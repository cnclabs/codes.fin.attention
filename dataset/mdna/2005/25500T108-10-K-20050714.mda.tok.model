overview we design  develop and market telecommunications equipment for use in canceling echo and enhancing voice quality in voice calls over wireline  wireless and internet protocol ip telecommunications networks 
as a result of announcing our intention to exit our optical communications business and completion of the sale of a substantial portion of assets used in our optical business in the first quarter of fiscal  our continuing operations are currently focused solely on our voice processing products  including our long standing echo cancellation products 
our initial entrance into the voice processing market was focused on echo cancellation 
since entering the voice processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our more recent product introductions have leveraged off the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also new voice quality assurance vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
we are currently selling our seventh generation echo cancellation product  which began production shipments in the third quarter of fiscal the majority of our r d spending in fiscal was directed toward the development of our packet voice processor  a new product targeting voice over internet protocol voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor introduces cost effective voice format transcoding capabilities and combines our voice quality assurance vqa software and newly developed packet quality assurance pqa technology to improve call quality and clarity by eliminating acoustic echo and voice level imbalances and reducing packet loss  delay and jitter 
since becoming a public company in june  our financial success has been primarily predicated on the success of the domestic wire line and more recently wireless carriers 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we benefited from the rapid expansion in domestic wire line infrastructure spending to support increasing demand expectations due to customer growth and the expectations of increased demand from internet traffic 
in the latter half of fiscal  as the promise of the internet s growth waned we  along with virtually every other telecommunications equipment supplier  experienced a significant decline in revenue due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending by domestic carriers 
over the last four years  wire line carriers have experienced a modest recovery in spending while wireless carriers have experienced more rapid growth 
however  beginning in calendar year  north american telecommunication service providers began a series of merger and acquisition activities and the affected telecommunications service providers are still assessing the network technology and deployment plans 
we expect such a trend will affect our near term revenue  as our revenue will continue to be heavily influenced by the buying trends of verizon wireless and nextel  two large domestic wireless carriers that are our two largest customers  one of which is involved in post merger integration 
in an attempt to reduce our reliance on our two large domestic customers  beginning in fiscal and throughout fiscal  we added sales and marketing resources to increase our presence and our vqa trial activity in the international marketplace and to focus on new large account opportunities in the united states 
we also expect that long term opportunities for growth will occur in voip based network deployments as there appears to be a growing trend of service providers transitioning away from traditional circuit switched network infrastructure to voip 
our packet voice processor targets these voip based networks 
we expect to begin to trial our new packet voice processor in the first quarter of fiscal exit of optical business 
in may  we announced a change to our strategic direction 
we decided to focus all of our assets in continuing to grow our voice processing business  including our echo cancellation and new vqa features  and as a result we decided to sell our optical communications business 
in july  we completed the primary step in our planned exit of our optical communications business through the sale of a large portion of the assets of the optical communications business to jds uniphase corporation jdsu 
the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory  certain specified optical related equipment and intellectual property rights  which were sold for an aggregate purchase price of up to approximately million in cash  of which a approximately million was paid to us at closing  b  to be paid to us one year from the closing subject to reduction in the event any successful indemnification claims are made against us  and c up to an additional million to be paid to us  which is comprised of up to  based on the level of inventory consumed by jdsu  and up to million based on revenues generated by the optical business acquired by jdsu through june   if any 
additionally  jdsu had the right to require us to reimburse jdsu for any purchased but unused inventory at june   up to million  which right expired as of july  jdsu also has indemnification rights in connection with the performance of certain warranty obligations relating to optical products that were sold by us on or prior to july  we and jdsu are currently evaluating the remaining obligations of each party  but have not reached agreement on what the remaining obligations are 
in fiscal  we recognized  associated with the level of revenue generated by jdsu since the close of the sale 
the proceeds were substantially offset by increased loss accruals associated with exiting our international optical operations and an estimated loss provision associated with our indemnification of the realizable value of the inventory purchased by jdsu 
the net effect of these items was reported as an incremental net loss on disposition of discontinued operations in fiscal of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal  income from discontinued operations was due to adjustments needed to reflect actual costs incurred and to recognize a tax benefit due to the release of our valuation reserve 
no additional revenue was recognized from the sale to jdsu 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have sold or abandoned all of the assets not purchased by jdsu 
as a result of exiting the optical business  our consolidated statements of operations reflect the optical business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition history 
since completing our initial public offering in june  we have completed three acquisitions 
at the time we made each of these acquisitions  they were made to bring needed technical skills into our research and development groups to aid in new product introductions 
the most recent  significant acquisition was in july  when we acquired atmosphere networks  inc to bring needed technical skills to our optical engineering group 
the total value of the acquisition was approximately million  which was accounted for using purchase accounting 
in may  we recorded a transitional impairment of the unamortized goodwill balance associated with this acquisition of million  which has been reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
in june  we announced that we acquired jasomi networks  inc  for million in cash and convertible notes plus assumed outstanding jasomi stock options and issued shares of ditech restricted stock to new employees assumed in the merger 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our customer base 
historically the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
these customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  sales to some of our us customers may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
we expect that as we expand shipments of our newer voice processing products  which are targeted at gsm networks  international revenue will begin to become a larger percentage of our overall revenue 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our two largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal our five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of any one of these customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a negative and substantial effect on our business 
for example  due to the decrease in projected purchases by one of our largest customers  we announced that we expect our first quarter fiscal revenue to be less than half of our fourth quarter fiscal revenue 
this announcement had a dramatic negative effect on our stock price 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenue  allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties and recovery of deferred income taxes 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
to the extent there are material differences between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of customers 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the united states and our relationships with them are documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred  of revenue 
to the extent that we have received cash for some or all of a given deferred revenue transaction  we reported it on the consolidated balance sheet as a deferred revenue liability 
however  to the extent that we have not collected cash against the deferred revenue transaction  we reflect the deferred revenue as a reduction in the corresponding account receivable balance 
of the  of revenue deferred as of april   the majority related to deferrals associated with maintenance contracts 
in dealing with smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
investments investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities  which we are able to liquidate on or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
other investment securities with remaining maturities of one year or more are considered long term investments 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of us government securities and corporate bonds  as well as  commercial paper  asset backed securities and certificates of deposit 
we have classified our short term and long term investments as available for sale securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are included in interest income based on specific identification 
interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included in interest income 
inventory valuation allowances in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation allowances  we are constantly monitoring projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of allowances required both for inventory on hand  as well as inventory on order from our contract manufacturer 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying allowance requirements in a timely manner  sudden changes in future buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels could result in some larger than anticipated write downs being recognized  such as the oc write down recorded in fiscal for the oc write down  the complete pull back from the forecasted demand by the primary customer for this product resulted in a million write down of the oc inventory 
however  in the addition of a few large new customers helped to utilize a large portion of the inventory which had been written down  resulting in approximately million and  of previously written down oc inventory being sold in fiscal and  respectively 
we sold no additional oc inventory in fiscal cost of warranty at the time that we recognize revenue  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer hardware warranties on our products ranging from two to five years and one year software warranties 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product and provide software bug fixes within the term of the warranty 
our accrual for the estimated warranty is based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures  which would result in a decrease in gross profits 
as of april   we had recorded million of accruals related to estimated future warranty costs 
in general  we have been able to closely estimate the level of warranty exposure on our products  and the level of adjustment required to the reserve has been relatively insignificant 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences  in conjunction with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at least once per quarter  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is no longer more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
beginning in fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance against our then existing deferred tax asset position was necessary 
we based this decision on the fact that in the fourth quarter of  we generated sufficient operating losses on a tax basis to fully recover all taxes paid in prior years 
in addition  our expectations of limited profitability  if any  due to the softness in the telecommunication industry during fiscal  combined with the significant tax losses generated by the sale of our echo cancellation software technology led us to conclude that the recovery of our deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not 
in the second quarter of  based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are deductible  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
we therefore released the valuation allowance of million in fiscal recent accounting pronouncements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance for identifying impaired investments and new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
on september   the fasb issued a final staff position fsp eitf issue that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs through of eitf quantitative and qualitative disclosures required by eitf remain unchanged by the staff position 
we do not believe the impact of adoption of the measurement provisions of the eitf will be significant to our overall results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  and  thus  will be effective for us beginning in fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas r on our financial position and results of operations 
see accounting for stock based compensation in note of the condensed consolidated financial statements for information related to the pro forma effects on our reported net income loss and net income loss per share of applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations other income  net income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations income tax provision from loss on discontinued operations gain loss on disposition income tax benefit from gain loss on disposition income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss discussion of fiscal years ended april   and revenue years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands revenue the increase in revenue in the last two years was largely driven by the addition of new customers  increased shipments to our two largest domestic wireless customers as they continued to expand and update their networks and  to a lesser extent  the expansion of our international customer base in asia  latin america and canada 
we believe that the introduction of our broadband voice processor flex bvp flex echo cancellation system in the third quarter of fiscal was critical in driving our revenue growth over the last two years 
in fiscal  our largest two domestic wireless customers accounted for of our revenue compared to of the revenue in fiscal and of the revenue in fiscal our third largest domestic customer accounted for of our revenue in fiscal  of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal in fiscal  sales of our broadband voice processor flex echo cancellation system  introduced in the third quarter of fiscal  accounted for of our revenue 
sales of vqa products running on both our bvp flex and qvp platforms accounted for million  or  of our revenue  primarily in the second half of the year  and included a  sale to nextel brazil 
we expected the sales of vqa products to be higher based on an order from an asian customer and acceptance from some customers that had been evaluating the product 
however  shipment of our vqa product to that asian customer did not materialize in fiscal as we expected and customer acceptance of vqa product being trialed elsewhere is taking longer than anticipated 
revenue growth in fiscal was largely driven by sales of our bvp system  which accounted for of our revenue compared to in the bvp flex system  despite the fact that it did not begin production shipment until late in the third quarter of fiscal  accounted for of our revenue in fiscal fiscal also saw the first revenue from our new qvp voice product  which includes our new voice quality features and is primarily targeted to the international gsm market 
we believe that the introduction of new products during fiscal and was a key contributor to acquiring and retaining our key strategic customers  as these new products have provided increased flexibility and easier installation for our customers 
geographically  revenue over the three fiscal years has been generated largely from domestic sales  which represented  and of our fiscal  and revenue  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of domestic sales over the three years was largely due to the growth in sales of our echo cancellation products to the domestic wireless telecommunications providers outpacing the growth in our international customer base 
while domestic sales continue to be the largest portion of our geographic revenue mix  we have begun to experience an increasing year over year trend in international revenue in terms of absolute dollar volume 
the relatively flat trend in domestic geographic concentration is largely being driven by the rate of growth in demand from our major domestic customers keeping pace with the growth in the smaller international portion of our business 
although we have successfully added customers internationally  the size of their order levels does not compare with that of our major domestic customers 
while our success in selling to international markets has been limited so far  we expect that in the coming year  the international portion of our business will begin to grow as a percentage of overall sales as we begin to realize more sales of our vqa applications 
however  we expect that our domestic customers will continue to represent the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we expect revenue in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million primarily due to a decline in shipments to one of our customers that was one of our two largest customers in fiscal and to a more normal level of shipments to our other large customer  from which we generated our highest ever historical quarterly sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue for the remainder of fiscal will be dependent on our success in adding new customers internationally  the network technology and deployment plans of the north american telecommunication service providers and  in the latter part of the fiscal year  the market acceptance of our new packet voice processor 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding forward looking statements such as the statements made in this paragraph about our expectations regarding our future revenue  as well as statements regarding our expectations in each of the categories below 
cost of goods sold years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  post sales installation costs  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal  despite higher revenue  was primarily due to favorable customer and product mixes and a million reduction in the inventory provision as substantially all of our older slower moving products had been fully reserved in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal was in large part driven by increased unit sales of our echo cancellation products  which contributed to a million increase over fiscal the other major factor impacting the increase in costs in was the write off of million of materials that were deemed too expensive or impractical to refurbish and an increase of approximately million in the level of installation costs due to increased shipments and an increase in the level of installation support requested by our customers 
our inventory provisions were  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our analysis of gross profit below discusses the other factors driving changes in cost of goods sold 
gross margin 
years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands gross profit gross margin pts pts the primary factor contributing to the percentage point increase in gross margin in fiscal was our favorable customer and product mix  as fiscal was heavily dominated by our bvp flex products  which have a higher overall gross margin than the products sold in fiscal shipments to our largest customer from fiscal had a somewhat lower margin than shipments to our largest customer in fiscal margins were also favorably impacted by the limited levels of excess and obsolete provisions  as virtually all of the product inventory identified as end of life near the end of fiscal was written down in fiscal leaving only minor levels of inventory other than our current qvp and bvp flex products 
partially offsetting the fiscal gross margin increases were lower sales of previously written down inventory 
in fiscal  we sold  of previously written down bvp and quad inventory compared to million of previously written down oc product in fiscal the fiscal gross margin increased percentage points compared to fiscal primarily for two reasons 
first  due to the addition of several new oc customers in fiscal  we began to sell previously written down oc product  which resulted in a benefit of million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  increasing gross margin by percentage points 
the other key factor in the improvement in gross margin in fiscal was the effect of our relatively fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
as these costs were relatively fixed over the period while revenue was steadily improving  we saw an improvement in our overall gross margin 
we expect that the previously noted decline in sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal while manufacturing costs remain relatively fixed will result in overall gross margins of 
over the next several quarters  we expect the price we charge our international customers will decline as we expand the distribution of our products through  value added resellers and distributors 
sales and marketing years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands sales and marketing expense of revenue pts pts sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was partly due to increases in salary and related costs  which increased million in fiscal  primarily due to incremental hiring of international sales and pre sales support staff as well as domestic sales and pre sales support staff focused on specific domestic opportunities 
travel expense increased  in fiscal  primarily to support international product evaluations of our qvp based products 
finally  outside service expenses increased  in fiscal to further support pre and post sales efforts in the field 
sales and marketing expenses began to trend up during fiscal as we expanded our efforts to introduce our qvp products internationally and commissions related to revenue that grew year over year 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly in fiscal as we launch our new packet voice processor 
research and development 
years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands research and development expense of revenue pts pts research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  materials and supplies used in the development of voice processing products 
the increase in spending in fiscal as compared to fiscal was partly related to increased salary and related costs of million and increased consulting and prototype materials costs of million 
these increases in spending were primarily associated with the development of our new packet voice processor 
our engineering staff grew to employees by the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal additionally  depreciation  allocations of facilities and information technology related costs and maintenance on software and equipment used by the engineering departments increased million 
this was due  in large part  to the increased demands from a larger engineering workforce 
in fiscal compared to fiscal  the largest increase was tied to increased headcount and related costs  as our engineering staff grew from employees at the end of fiscal to employees at the end of fiscal in addition  depreciation expense increased  due to increased levels of lab equipment to support voice processing product development 
we expect slight increases in our research and development spending due to the jasomi networks  inc acquisition and further development of the packet voice processor 
general and administrative years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands general and administrative expense of revenue pts pts general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
the fiscal increases in general and administrative spending were largely due to increased consulting  professional service costs and audit fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance work and international expansion  which resulted in an aggregate increase in spending of over million 
additionally  bad debt expense was  lower in fiscal due to credits taken in fiscal for an adjustment to our bad debt reserve based on improved collection efforts 
there were no such adjustments to the reserve in fiscal the somewhat higher levels of spending in fiscal compared to were due in large part to a  increase in salaries and related expense due to hiring and financial performance driven bonuses and  of initial spending related to international expansion and sarbanes oxley compliance 
those spending increases were mostly offset by a  reduction in bad debt expense due to credits taken in fiscal based on an improvement in our customer collection experience   lower annual report costs and the elimination of cheap stock amortization  which resulted in a  reduction in expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decline slightly in fiscal as our second year of sarbanes oxley compliance will require less use of outside resources 
restructuring years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands restructuring of revenue pts pts restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge recognized in fiscal was attributable to the elimination of redundant general corporate level costs  personnel and facilities  which were impacted as a result of exiting the optical business  but did not qualify for inclusion in discontinued operations 
these costs included  of severance and related benefits and a loss provision associated with the abandonment of a portion of our mountain view facilities of  as a result  the fiscal year reflects a net loss provision of  related to our building and employee severance costs 
other income  net years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands other income  net of revenue pts pts other income  net consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalent and investment balances  offset by a nominal amount of interest and other expense 
the increase in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to higher interest income  due to our larger invested cash balance and an improvement in the return on our invested cash as interest rates have begun to increase 
the decrease in other income in fiscal compared to  net was primarily attributable to lower interest rates reducing earnings on our invested balances 
our interest income will be dependent on our cash balances and the movement of us interest rates 
income taxes  continuing operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands income taxes  continuing operations of revenue pts pts income taxes 
income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the benefit in fiscal includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit related to our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit to continuing operations of million 
the majority of the valuation allowance was released in the second quarter of  based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are deductible the remainder of the valuation allowance was released over the third and fourth quarters 
the recognition of the deferred tax assets had no impact on our fiscal cash flows 
partially offsetting the tax benefit recorded was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries and state and federal alternative minimum tax totaling  in fiscal the income taxes incurred in fiscal were due to providing alternative minimum taxes on our domestic operations 
there was no tax provision for continuing operations in fiscal due to our loss 
we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately in fiscal income loss from discontinued operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands loss from discontinued operations income tax provision from loss on discontinued operations gain loss on disposition income tax benefit from gain loss on disposition income loss from discontinued operations of revenue pts pts the reduction of the loss in our discontinued optical business in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due in large part to reductions in spending subsequent to september  when we discontinued our optical system product development 
as a result  there was a significant decline in spending on salaries and materials in fiscal in addition  fiscal also benefited from reduced spending on optical communications marketing and development after our announcement to exit the optical business in may and the elimination of substantially all optical costs effective july as all operations related to our optical business ceased in fiscal  we did not have further losses from this discontinued operation in fiscal the  gain on disposition in fiscal was due to adjustments needed to reflect actual costs incurred 
the loss on disposition in fiscal reflects the aggregate loss of million realized in the first quarter of fiscal upon the sale of the optical technology  inventory and certain fixed assets to jdsu  along with other exit costs associated with abandoning that portion of the optical business not acquired by jdsu 
subsequent adjustments to the loss resulted in an incremental loss of approximately  and were included in the total loss from disposal of our discontinued optical operations of million for fiscal in the consolidated statement of operations 
we expect that the only future discontinued operations activity will be associated with final resolution of the contingent consideration and resolution of indemnification obligations between jdsu and us  as well as final wind up costs of international optical operations 
see note of notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the million cumulative effect of an accounting change reported in fiscal represents the transitional impairment loss for previously recorded goodwill associated with our acquisition of atmosphere  which we recorded in connection with our adoption of sfas effective may  there were no accounting changes in fiscal or stock based compensation associated with the acquisition of atmosphere on july   we recorded million of deferred compensation related to unvested options assumed in the acquisition 
this deferred compensation was amortized to research and development expense over the remaining vesting terms of the assumed options  which became fully vested in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the acquisition of atmosphere  we issued nonqualified stock options for approximately  shares of our common stock at a price equal to a discount from the market value of the stock on its grant date of august  the discount was recorded as deferred compensation of million in august subsequent to recording this deferred compensation in august  the gross amount of deferred compensation was reduced from time to time for the impact of option cancellations due to employee terminations 
due to the cancellation of all remaining options from this august grant  as part of our option exchange program as described below  the remaining deferred compensation of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no further amortization of this deferred compensation occurred in fiscal or as this deferred compensation was solely attributable to optical operations  the amortization expense has been included in the loss from discontinued operations for all years presented 
the atmosphere related deferred compensation expense totaled approximately million in fiscal in february  we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees  including officers 
we implemented this program in order to align employee and stockholder interests while sustaining high levels of performance during the then stagnant economic period 
a large number of our employees stock option exercise prices were significantly higher than the current market price of ditech common stock and  in an effort to motivate and retain our employees  our board approved this stock option exchange program 
under this program  eligible employees were offered the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding stock options with exercise prices of or more for new replacement options pursuant to the terms of the program 
the original options exchanged were canceled on march  on september   we issued options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock  representing of the number of shares originally subject to options exchanged for those individuals still employed by us on september  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  additionally  we had million of short term investments and no long term investments as of april   compared to million of short term and million of long term investments as of april  since march  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal cash flows from operating activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from operating activities the improvement in our cash flow from operations reflects the overall improvement in our operating results due in large part to increased product shipments 
in addition  our exiting the optical communications business in the first quarter of fiscal also favorably impacted our operating results in fiscal by dramatically reducing the level of spending we had previously invested in this product line 
in fiscal  we increased our spending as we invested in our new packet voice processor  international expansion and focused domestic opportunities  as well as sarbanes oxley compliance 
the combination of revenue growth  the elimination of our optical communications business and leveraged spending growth has contributed to our return to profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities in fiscal and compared to fiscal  fiscal showed growth in accounts receivable  which increased due to somewhat unfavorable sales linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and reductions in deferred revenue 
although we expect to see positive cash flows from operations in the coming year  they may not be in the same ratio to income from continuing operations before the provision for income taxes as fiscal  largely due to expected increases in accounts receivable as we enter new customer markets internationally  which may prolong payment terms somewhat  and as we introduce our new packet voice processor products  which may increase inventory levels 
cash flows from investing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from investing activities the change in the trend of cash flows from investing activities is due to two key events 
first  in fiscal  we changed our investing strategy to include short term and long term investments designed to improve our overall return on invested funds  which accounted for the majority of the cash used in fiscal and partially offsetting this use of cash in fiscal and contributing to the positive cash flows from investing activities in fiscal was the collection of proceeds from the sale of our echo cancellation software technology in fiscal and collection of the related purchase price installments in fiscal and of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and to a lesser degree the collection of sales proceeds from the sale of our optical business in fiscal of million 
in fiscal  we collected proceeds from the sale of our optical business and other minor sales of optical equipment of only  our acquisition of jasomi networks  inc on june  used approximately million of cash in fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we also plan to continue to invest in capital assets related to new product introductions and to support our efforts to sell new products internationally 
cash flows from financing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from financing activities the decrease in cash flow from financing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely due to the repurchase of shares of common stock  as discussed below  partially offset by funds received from stock option exercises 
stock option activity in the first half of fiscal was particularly high following the trend in our stock price over that same period 
the increase in cash flow from financing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to funds received upon stock option exercises 
the stock option activity in fiscal was largely due to option exercises by employees impacted by the restructuring of our optical business prior to the cancellation of those options  as well as options exercised by existing employees 
stock repurchase program in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a stock repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
consequently  we are not authorized to repurchase additional shares under the stock repurchase program 
the aggregate purchase price of the shares of our common stock repurchased was reflected as a reduction to shareholders equity 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins  we allocated the purchase price of the repurchased shares as a reduction to retained earnings  common stock and additional paid in capital 
commitments we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility leases  and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters 
this facility lease expires in june our contractual commitments  by year in which they become due  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year to years to years over years operating leases purchase commitments total in addition  as part of the optical sale agreement with jdsu  jdsu had the right to require us to indemnify jdsu for any purchased but unused inventory at june   up to million  and certain costs incurred by jdsu in connection with the performance of certain warranty obligations relating to optical products that we sold prior to july  we and jdsu are currently evaluating the remaining obligations of each party  but have not reached agreement on what the remaining obligations are 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next two years from our existing cash and short term investments 
we currently expect to renew our million line of credit  which expires in july the ability to fund our operations beyond the next two fiscal years will be dependent on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment 
should our customers significantly reduce their purchases of our products compared to current levels of purchases  we could need to find additional sources of cash during fiscal or be forced to reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
future growth and operating results subject to risk our business and the value of our stock are subject to a number of risks  which are set out below 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  which would likely have a corresponding impact on the value of our common stock 
these risk factors should be carefully reviewed 
we depend on a limited number of customers for our products  the loss of any one of which could cause our revenue to decrease 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
our two largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of our revenue in fiscal a customer may stop buying our products or significantly reduce its orders for our products for a number of reasons  including the acquisition of a customer by another company  financial difficulties or a delay in a scheduled product introduction 
if this happens  our revenue could be greatly reduced  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
due to continuing difficult economic conditions  many operators in the telecommunications industry have experienced financial difficulties  which have impacted their capital expenditures and  in some cases  resulted in their filing for bankruptcy or being acquired by other operators 
in calendar year  north american telecommunication service providers began a series of merger and acquisition activities and the affected telecommunication service providers are still assessing the network technology and deployment plans 
in any merger  product purchases for network deployment may be reviewed  postponed or canceled based on revised plans for technology or network expansion for the merged entity  which we believe has happened at nextel  leading to the majority of our projected decline in first quarter of fiscal revenue 
if this situation occurs at other customers  it may result in the delay of product purchases or the loss of those customers 
we are reliant solely on our voice quality business to generate revenue growth and profitability  which could limit our rate of future revenue growth 
we expect that  at least through fiscal  our sole business will be the design  development and marketing of voice processing products 
however  the relatively small size of the overall echo cancellation portion of the voice market  which is where we have derived the majority of our revenue to date  could limit the rate of growth of our business 
in addition  certain telecommunication service providers may utilize different technologies  such as voip  which would further limit demand for products we sold in fiscal  which are deployed in wireline networks 
although we expect to begin to trial our packet voice processor for use in the voip market in the first quarter of fiscal  we do not expect to generate meaningful revenue in fiscal our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we anticipate that they may continue to do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors  some of which are outside of our control 
if revenue significantly declines in a quarter  as we experienced in the second half of fiscal  again in the second quarter of fiscal and as we expect to experience in the first quarter of fiscal  our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter 
adverse changes in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
for example  when we announced in may that we expected our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal would be less than half of our revenue in the last quarter to fiscal  our stock price dropped from a closing price of just prior to our announcement to a closing price of per share on the day following our announcement 
our revenue may vary from period to period 
factors that could cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period include changes in capital spending in the telecommunications industry and larger macroeconomic trends  the timing or cancellation of orders from  or shipments to  existing and new customers  the loss of  or a significant decline in orders from  a customer  delays outside of our control in obtaining necessary components from our suppliers  delays outside of our control in the installation of products for our customers  the timing of new product and service introductions by us  our customers  our partners or our competitors  delays in timing of revenue recognition  due to new contractual terms with customers  competitive pricing pressures  variations in the mix of products offered by us  and variations in our sales or distribution channels 
in particular  sales of our echo cancellation products typically come from our major customers ordering large quantities when they deploy a switching center 
consequently  we may get one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then no orders in the next quarter 
as a result  our revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our customers may delay or rescind orders for our existing products in anticipation of the release of our or our competitors new products  due to merger and acquisition activity or if they are unable to put credit facilities in place 
further  if our or our competitors new products substantially replace the functionality of our existing products  our existing products may become obsolete  which could result in inventory write downs  and or we could be forced to sell them at reduced prices or even at a loss 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is typically lengthy 
before ordering our products  our customers perform significant technical evaluations  which typically last up to days or more for our base echo cancellation systems and up to days or more for our newer vqa product offering 
once an order is placed  delivery times can vary depending on the product ordered 
as a result  revenue forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter may not occur in that quarter 
because of the potential large size of our customers orders  this would adversely affect our revenue for the quarter 
our expenses may vary from period to period 
many of our expenses do not vary with our revenue 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the extent of marketing and sales efforts necessary to promote and sell our products  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  the availability and cost of key components for our products  and the timing of personnel hiring 
if we incur such additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue  our operating results would be adversely affected 
if we do not successfully develop and introduce new products  our products may become obsolete 
we operate in an industry that experiences rapid technological change  and if we do not successfully develop and introduce new products and our existing products become obsolete due to product introductions by competitors  our revenues will decline 
even if we are successful in developing new products  we may not be able to successfully produce or market our new products in commercial quantities  or increase our overall sales levels 
these risks are of particular concern when a new generation product is introduced 
although we believe we will achieve our product introduction dates  there is no guarantee that they will not be delayed 
the recent product introductions  which are of greatest significance  are our new voice quality features  which are being offered on our bvp flex and qvp voice processing hardware platforms 
we are currently experiencing numerous customer evaluations of these features around the world and realized our first modest levels of revenue from these new products in the fourth quarter of fiscal these evaluations are taking longer than we first anticipated 
we expect more significant levels of revenue from these new features in fiscal however  should the customer evaluation process become further protracted or the product not meet the customers expectations  the timing of our realization of any revenues from these new products could be delayed or not materialize at all 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we will begin to trial our packet voice processor  a new product targeting voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor provides voice processing functionality to enable the deployment of end to end voip services 
this is the first packet based product developed by us 
the product may not be accepted in the market due to feature or capabilities mis matches with customer requirements  pricing of the product  inadequately developed technical capabilities  or limitations of our sales and marketing force to properly interact with customers to communicate the benefits of the product 
we have in the past experienced  and in the future may experience  unforeseen delays in the development of our new products 
for example  in fiscal  sales of our fourth generation echo cancellers and our broadband system generated the majority of our echo revenue while sales of our fifth generation  oc echo cancellation system fell short of our expectations due to a sudden decline in projected demand in the third quarter of fiscal from our primary targeted customer for this product  qwest 
this unexpected drop in demand for the oc product led to the write down of million of excess inventory in the third quarter of fiscal although we were eventually able to sell this product after having written it down  there can be no assurances that we will be able to sell additional written down units in the future 
we must devote a substantial amount of resources in order to develop and achieve commercial acceptance of our new products  most recently  our packet voice processor and our voice quality features offered on our bvp flex and qvp hardware platforms 
our new and or existing products may not be able to address evolving demands in the telecommunications market in a timely or effective way 
even if they do  customers in these markets may purchase or otherwise implement competing products 
we operate in an industry experiencing rapid technological change  which may make our products obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop  introduce and market enhancements to our existing products and to introduce new products in a timely manner to meet our customers requirements 
the markets we target are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these rapid changes 
the emerging nature of these products and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products  particularly in response to competitive product offerings 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these developments 
the introduction or market acceptance of products incorporating superior technologies or the emergence of alternative technologies and new industry standards could render our existing products  as well as our products currently under development  obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  we may have only a limited amount of time to penetrate certain markets  and we may not be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
we may fail to anticipate or respond on a cost effective and timely basis to technological developments  changes in industry standards or end user requirements 
we may also experience significant delays in product development or introduction 
in addition  we may fail to release new products or to upgrade or enhance existing products on a timely basis 
we may need to modify our products as a result of changes in industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards  whether through adoption by official standards committees or widespread use by service providers  could require us to redesign our products 
if such standards become widespread  and our products are not in compliance  our current and potential customers may not purchase our products 
the rapid development of new standards increases the risk that our competitors could develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards before us 
acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we review acquisition and investment prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  augment our market coverage  secure supplies of critical materials or enhance our technological capabilities 
for example  in june we acquired jasomi networks  inc acquisitions or investments could result in a number of financial consequences  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large one time write offs  reduced cash balances and related interest income  higher fixed expenses which require a higher level of revenues to maintain gross margins  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to other acquisition related intangible assets and impairment of goodwill 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous operational risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  diversion of resources from our existing businesses  products or technologies  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
if we lose the services of any of our key management or key technical personnel  or are unable to retain or attract additional technical personnel  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be impaired 
we depend heavily on key management and technical personnel  for the conduct and development of our business and the development of our products 
however  there is no guarantee that if we lost the services of one or more of these people for any reason  that it would not adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our business and to develop new products 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
however  we may not be able to do so 
we anticipate that average selling prices for our products will decline in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to be profitable 
we expect that the price we can charge our customers for our products will decline as new technologies become available  as we expand the distribution of products through value added resellers and distributors internationally and as competitors lower prices either as a result of reduced manufacturing costs or a strategy of cutting margins to achieve or maintain market share 
if this occurs  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we expect price reductions to be more pronounced due to our planned expansion internationally 
while we intend to reduce our manufacturing costs in an attempt to maintain our margins and to introduce enhanced products with higher selling prices  we may not execute these programs on schedule 
in addition  our competitors may drive down prices faster or lower than our planned cost reduction programs 
even if we can reduce our manufacturing costs  many of our operating costs will not decline immediately if revenue decreases due to price competition 
in order to respond to increasing competition and our anticipation that average selling prices will decrease  we are attempting to reduce manufacturing costs of our new and existing products 
if we do not reduce manufacturing costs and average selling prices decrease  our operating results will be adversely affected 
manufacturing is currently outsourced to primarily one contract manufacturer 
we believe that our current contract manufacturing relationship provides us with competitive manufacturing costs for our products 
however  if we or this contract manufacturer terminates our relationship  or if we otherwise establish new relationships  we may encounter problems in the transition of manufacturing to another contract manufacturer  which could temporarily increase our manufacturing costs and cause production delays 
we face intense competition  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  continually evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  including our customers 
certain of our customers also have the ability to internally produce the equipment that they currently purchase from us 
in such cases  we also compete with their internal product development capabilities 
we expect that competition will increase in the future 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully 
we face competition from two major direct manufacturers of stand alone voice processing products  tellabs and natural microsystems 
the other competition in these markets comes from voice switch manufacturers 
these manufacturers do not sell voice processing products or compete in the stand alone voice processing product market  but they integrate voice processing functionality within their switches  either as hardware modules or as software running on chips 
a more widespread adoption of internal voice processing solutions would present an increased competitive threat to us  if the net result was the elimination of demand for our voice processing system products 
with the downturn in spending in the telecommunications industry  service providers appear to be exploring these alternative sources of voice processing more thoroughly  while they wait for more robust capital spending budgets to return 
if our customers decide to design these alternative sources of voice processing functionality into their future network expansion  it could adversely impact the speed and duration of our sales recovery 
most of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we will 
we now license our echo cancellation software from texas instruments  and if we do not receive the level of support we expect from texas instruments  it could adversely affect our echo cancellation systems business 
in april  we sold our echo cancellation software technology and future revenue streams from our licenses of acquired technology to texas instruments  in return for cash and a long term license of the echo cancellation software 
although the licensing agreement has strong guarantees of support for the software used in our products  if texas instruments were to breach that agreement in some fashion  and not deliver complete and timely support to us  our success in the echo cancellation systems business could be adversely affected 
if texas instruments licenses its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies  this could increase the competitive pressures on our echo cancellation systems business 
under the terms of the sale agreement of our echo cancellation software to texas instruments  texas instruments is precluded from licensing the software to other echo cancellation systems companies for a period of two years from the date of the sale and to two specified competitors for a period of four years from the date of sale 
if texas instruments were to license its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies now that the two year period has expired  it could increase the level of competition and adversely affect our success in our echo cancellation systems business 
if incumbent and emerging competitive service providers and the telecommunications industry as a whole experience another downturn or reduction in growth rate  the demand for our products will decrease  which will adversely affect our business 
we have experienced  as have other companies in our sector  a slowdown in infrastructure spending by our customers 
this trend of lower capital spending in the telecommunications industry contributed to the decline in our revenues  beginning in the second half of fiscal  and although we have experienced some level of recovery in sales to these customers  sales have not fully recovered to the levels we saw prior to the decline in fiscal our success will continue to depend in large part on development  expansion and or upgrade of voice and communications networks 
we are subject to risks of growth constraints due to our current and planned dependence on domestic and international telecommunications service providers 
these potential customers may be constrained for a number of reasons  including their limited capital resources  economic conditions  changes in regulation and mergers or consolidations which we have seen in north america since calendar year some of the key components used in our products are currently available only from sole sources  the loss of which could delay product shipments 
we rely on certain suppliers as the sole source of certain key components that we use in our products 
for example  we rely on texas instruments as the sole source supplier for the digital signal processors used in our echo cancellation and voice enhancement products 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
any extended interruption in the supply of these components would affect our ability to meet scheduled deliveries of our products to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these components  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships  and we could lose customers and orders 
additionally  because these suppliers are the sole source of these components  we are at risk that adverse increases in the price of these components could have negative impacts on the cost of our products or require us to find alternative  less expensive components  which would have to be designed into our products in an effort to avoid erosion in our product margin 
some suppliers of key components may reduce their inventory levels which could result in longer lead times for future component purchases and any delays in filling our demand may reduce or delay our expected product shipments and revenues 
although we believe there are currently ample supplies of components for our products  it is possible that in the near term component manufacturers may reduce their inventory levels and require firm orders before they manufacture components 
this reduction in stocking levels could lead to extended lead times in the future 
if we are unable to procure our planned quantities of materials from all prospective suppliers  and if we cannot use alternative components  we could experience revenue delays or reductions and potential harm to customer relationships 
an example of this risk occurred in the third quarter of fiscal as two suppliers supplying us with components used in our oc product did not meet our total demand 
as a result  the schedule shipment of our oc product was delayed  which contributed to our revenue shortfall in that quarter 
we may experience unforeseen problems as we diversify our international customer base  which would impair our ability to grow our business 
historically  we have sold mostly to customers in north america 
we are continuing to execute on our plans to expand our international presence through the establishment of new relationships with established international value added resellers and distributors 
however  we may still be required to hire additional personnel for the overseas market  as we have seen over the last couple of quarters  and may incur other unforeseen expenditures related to our international expansion 
despite these efforts  to date our planned expansion overseas has met with limited success and there is no guarantee of future success 
as we expand our sales focus farther into international markets  we will face new and complex issues that we may not have faced before  such as expanded risk to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  manufacturing overseas  political or economic instability  potential adverse tax consequences and broadened import export controls  which will put additional strain on our management personnel 
in the past  the vast majority of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars  however  in the future  we may be forced to denominate a greater amount of international sales in foreign currencies 
additionally  the number of installations we will be responsible for may increase as a result of our continued international expansion and recognition of revenue may be dependent on acceptances 
in addition  we may not be able to establish more relationships with international value added resellers and distributors 
if we do not  our ability to increase sales could be materially impaired 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which we may not be able to protect 
we may rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  such measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
we currently are  and in the future may be  subject to securities class action lawsuits due to decreases in our stock price 
we are at risk of being subject to securities class action lawsuits if our stock price declines substantially 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
for example  in may  we announced that we expected our first quarter fiscal revenue to be approximately one half of our last quarter fiscal revenue  and our stock price declined dramatically 
on june   a lawsuit entitled richard e 
jaffe v 
ditech communications corp  timothy k 
montgomery and william j 
tamblyn  case no 
c was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who purchased ditech s stock between august  and may  the complaint alleges claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of against the ditech and our chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
we expect that several similar lawsuits will subsequently be filed in the same court  and that all of the cases will be consolidated into a single action 
in addition  a shareholder s derivative suit has been filed against our directors and the same two executive officers  and has named ditech nominally as a defendant  making similar allegations 
we cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits 
if our stock price declines substantially in the future  we may be the target of similar litigation 
the current  and any future  securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may still assert infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
such assertions could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term and long term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments are primarily maintained at four major financial institutions in the united states 
as of april   we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk  and we attempt to achieve this by diversifying our portfolio in a variety of highly rated investment securities that have limited terms to maturity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but current maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities  which management is able to liquidate on or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
other investment securities with remaining maturities of one year or more are considered long term investments 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of us government securities and corporate bonds  as well as  commercial paper  asset backed securities and certificates of deposit 
short term and long term investments are maintained at three major financial institutions  are classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if we sell our short term or long term investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
in fiscal  and  we realized no gains or losses on our short or long term investments 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of our investments as of april   based on a discounted cash flow calculation over the remaining term of each investment  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
