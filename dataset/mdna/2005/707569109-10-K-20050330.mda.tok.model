item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operations we are a leading  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and operator of gaming properties  as well as horse racetracks and associated off track wagering facilities  or otws 
we own or operate nine gaming properties located in colorado  illinois  louisiana  mississippi  ontario and west virginia that are focused primarily on serving customers within driving distance of the properties 
we also own one racetrack and six otws in pennsylvania  one racetrack in west virginia  one racetrack in maine  and through a joint venture  own and operate a racetrack in new jersey 
on february   we completed the purchase of bangor historic track  inc which operates harness racing at the city owned track at bass park in bangor  maine 
we operate in two segments  gaming and racing  and derive substantially all of our revenues from such operations 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past few years and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
on march   we completed our largest acquisition to date  the acquisition of hollywood casino corporation 
the hollywood casino corporation acquisition significantly increased our revenues and cash flow 
in maine  subsequent to our february  purchase of bangor historic track  inc  we were granted an unconditional racing license for and a renewal for and operated a day harness meet at bass park in bangor 
the annual license represents the first regulatory approval necessary for us to proceed with our anticipated million development project for a  slot machine gaming facility and to satisfy a condition precedent to completing our purchase of bangor historic track 
on july   pennsylvania governor edward g 
rendell signed into law the pennsylvania race horse development and gaming act 
our plan is to develop a completely new gaming and racing facility at our penn national race course in grantville  pennsylvania 
under this plan  we expect to open in a new permanent facility with  slot machines within approximately one year after receiving a license at an estimated cost of million  inclusive of the million gaming license fee  and expand to up to  machines based on demand 
while we would have preferred to develop the site  as a result of the ownership restrictions on a second slot license in the pennsylvania gaming law  on october  we announced our agreement to sell our pocono downs facilities  land and otws to the mohegan tribal gaming authority 
this sale was completed on january  most notably  on november   we and argosy gaming company announced that our boards of directors unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of argosy for per share in cash 
the transaction is valued at approximately billion  including approximately million of long term debt of argosy and its subsidiaries 
upon closing  the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to our earnings per share 
on january   argosy s shareholders approved the merger agreement 
this transaction is an extremely significant step for us 
the vast majority of our revenue is gaming revenues derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and  to a lesser extent  table games 
racing revenues are derived from wagering on our live races  wagering on import simulcasts at our racetracks and otws and through telephone account wagering  and fees from wagering on export simulcasting our races 
other revenues are derived from hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities 
we intend to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties and the continued pursuit of strategic acquisitions of gaming properties particularly in attractive regional markets 
key performance indicators related to revenues are gaming revenue indicators slot handle volume indicator  table game drop volume indicator and win or hold percentages  which are not fully controllable by us 
our typical slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle and our typical table games win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop  and racing revenue indicators pari mutuel wagering commissions volume indicator earned on wagering on our live races  wagering on import simulcasts at our racetracks and otws and through telephone account wagering  and fees from wagering on export simulcasting our races 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund capital maintenance expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions 
we have reflected the results of the transactions for the disposition of hollywood casino shreveport and the downs racing  inc by classifying the assets  liabilities and results of operations of hollywood casino shreveport and the downs racing  inc as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
a gain or loss on either of these transactions has not been recorded or recognized as of december  since the sales have not yet been deemed completed

as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from acquisitions of gaming properties at reasonable valuations  jurisdictional expansions and  to a lesser extent  property expansion in under penetrated markets 
the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes  as illustrated by our experience in illinois in consistent with the consolidation trend in the gaming industry  the company has been very active in acquisitions 
we have acquired five casino properties  the casino rama management contract  and bangor historic track  inc since january   and on november  we announced the proposed acquisition of argosy gaming company 
a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance in pennsylvania and maine and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as maryland 
the timing and occurrence of these events remain uncertain 
legalized gaming from casinos located on native american lands can also have a significant competitive effect 
the continued demand for  and the company s emphasis on  slot wagering entertainment at our properties  which revenue is the consistently profitable segment of the gaming industry 
the continued expansion and revenue gains at our charles town entertainment complex 
financing in a favorable interest environment and under an improved credit profile facilitates our growth 
the racing revenues continue to decline at each of our racing properties 
however  our gaming revenues have increased and  as a result  our racing revenues represent a less significant percentage of our overall revenue

hollywood casino shreveport notes hollywood casino shreveport  or hcs  and shreveport capital corporation are co issuers of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due and million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage notes due  which we refer to in this document as the hollywood casino shreveport notes 
hollywood casino shreveport is a general partnership that owns the casino operations 
shreveport capital corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of hollywood casino shreveport formed solely for the purpose of being a co issuer of the hollywood casino shreveport notes 
the hollywood casino shreveport notes are non recourse to us and our subsidiaries other than hollywood casino shreveport  shreveport capital corporation  hcs i  inc  hcs ii  inc 
and hwcc louisiana  inc  which we refer to as the shreveport entities and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the casino  the first mortgage notes are secured by the partnership interests held by hcs i  inc and hcs ii  inc 
and the stock held by hwcc louisiana  inc further  an event of default under the indentures for the hollywood casino shreveport notes does not cause an event of default under the company s senior secured credit facility or senior subordinated notes 
the hollywood casino shreveport notes have been in default under the terms of their respective note indentures since may and accordingly are classified as current obligations within liabilities held for sale at december  critical accounting estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the estimated lives assigned to our assets  asset impairment  insurance reserves  the purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be those in which our policies  estimates and judgments have a significant impact on issues that are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of million  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
intangible assets  including goodwill as a result of our recent acquisitions  we have approximately million in goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of other businesses 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  a valuation was completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuation included data gathered as result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisition and projections for future operations 
the annual evaluation of goodwill requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill is no longer amortized  there may be more volatility in reported income than under previous accounting standards because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly in varying amounts 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
accounting pronouncements issued or adopted in in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  stock based payment sfas r 
this statement replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas  statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
sfas r is effective the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   which will be for the period covered by our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of we currently account for stock option grants using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb under the intrinsic value method  because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options is equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
if we would have applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we would have had a charge to earnings of million for stock based employee compensation  net of related income taxes  for item a

for debt obligations  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates

we entered into these interest rates swap agreements due to the requirements of the then current senior secured credit facility and to reduce the impact of future variable interest payments related to such senior secured credit facility 
in  we accounted for the effective interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
the changes in the fair values of effective interest rate swaps were recorded as adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  which as of december  amounted to million  net of an income tax benefit of million

the hedge designation was removed 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts are recognized as adjustments to loss on change in fair values of interest rate swaps in the accompanying statements of income in the period in which they occur 
accordingly  we have recorded a non cash pre tax loss of million  or 
per diluted share after tax  for the year ended december  amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income over the remaining term of the swap as we incur interest expense on the replacement debt 
over the next twelve months  approximately  will be reclassified to income

there are three two year swap contracts totaling million with an effective date of march  and a termination date of march  under these contracts  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate based on the day libor rate 
we also entered into three three year swap contracts totaling million with a termination date of march  we accounted for these effective interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
the changes in the fair values of effective interest rate swaps were recorded as adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the amount of ineffectiveness related to the cash flow hedges in  was immaterial 
under these contracts  we pay fixed rates of to against a variable rate based on the day libor rate 
the difference between amounts received and amounts paid under such agreements  as well as any costs or fees  is recorded as a reduction of  or addition to  interest expense as incurred over the life of the swap 
on september   we terminated our million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire on march  we paid  to terminate the swap agreement 
on december   we terminated our million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire on march  we received  to terminate the swap agreement
