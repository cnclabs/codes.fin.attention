item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the following summarizes our results for the three year period ended march  bar chart bar chart other consists of the financial results of our investment real estate operations  home services operations  corporate general and administrative expense and interest expense 
fiscal year represents our ninth consecutive year of growth in revenues and earnings from continuing operations 
revenues increased to billion as compared to fiscal year in addition  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to billion as compared to fiscal year the growth in revenues and operating earnings is primarily attributable to the growth and improvement in operating margin of our home building segment 
home building s operating earnings growth was slightly offset by a decline in operating earnings of our financial services segment in fiscal year the primary drivers of the growth in our home building business are growth in neighborhoods open for sale  increases in closings per neighborhood  increases in average unit selling prices  and improvements in operating margins 
in fiscal  we experienced improvements in each of these key areas 
home building s domestic operating margin operating earnings as a percentage of revenues increased to 
for more specific information on the operating results of our home building segment  refer to the home building segment information below 
the overall demand for housing in the united states remains favorable  and is driven by population growth  demographics  immigration  household formations and increasing home ownership rates 
short term 
table of contents growth drivers such as mortgage rates  consumer confidence and employment levels can also impact housing demand 
the highly fragmented homebuilding industry in the united states is in the early stages of a consolidation phase during which large homebuilders grow faster than the industry as a whole 
in  based upon single family permits issued in the united states  the largest homebuilders represented approximately of the housing market 
in calendar year  the largest homebuilders were producing approximately of the nation s new housing stock 
we believe industry consolidation will continue to be an important growth factor over the next decade or more as large homebuilders realize the benefits of size  such as capital strength  more efficient operations and technological advantages 
currently  we have homebuilding operations in of the largest housing markets in the united states housing market data obtained from professional builder magazine 
we have largely completed our geographic diversification plan and are now focused primarily on further penetration in our existing markets 
financial services operating results in fiscal year have been negatively impacted by decreased loan refinancing activity  increases in interest rates and  for our prime mortgage lending operations  an increase in the origination of less profitable adjustable rate mortgages 
ctx mortgage company  llc s refinancing activity accounted for of its originations for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  refinancing activity has declined due to an extended period of relatively low mortgage loan rates  which has reduced the supply of loans likely to be refinanced 
our financial services segment will continue to focus on serving the customers of our home building segment and increasing the percentage of prime mortgage loans provided to them 
for the year ended march   our prime mortgage lending business financed approximately of our home building non cash unit closings 
in addition  the financial services growth model includes plans to increase the number of loan officers originating prime retail loans and improve their productivity 
our prime mortgage lending business is a fee based business with low capital requirements 
our financial services segment also includes our sub prime home equity lending operations  which is a portfolio based model that produces more predictable earnings 
our sub prime home equity loans are obtained principally through our organically grown origination channels using centrally controlled product  pricing and underwriting 
home equity s revenues and operating earnings have increased and  respectively  as compared to fiscal year the growth in revenues and operating earnings is primarily as a result of continued growth in home equity s portfolio of residential mortgage loans held for investment and a program of whole loan sales to third parties 
the financial services growth model includes plans to continue to grow our portfolio of sub prime mortgage loans held for investment while adhering to our underwriting criteria 
we will primarily securitize these loans and certain loans will be included in whole loan sales 
the results of operations of certain of our segments  including our home building and financial services operations  may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
any significant increase in mortgage interest rates above current prevailing levels could affect demand for housing  at least in the short term  and could reduce the ability or willingness of prospective home buyers to finance home purchases and or it could curtail mortgage refinance activity 
although we expect that we would make adjustments in our operations in an effort to mitigate the effects of any increase in interest rates  there can be no assurances that these efforts would be successful 
our construction services segment operating earnings have increased from the prior year  but have not reached the levels achieved in fiscal industry conditions have created increased pricing pressure on construction companies  which in turn has reduced our construction services operating margins 
however  revenues have increased over the last two years due to our focus on increasing market share 
the commercial construction environment remains challenged but is showing signs of improvement as evidenced by the increase in backlog 
at march   the backlog was billion  an increase of over the prior year 
strategically  we will continue to focus on our core geographic and selected industry segments to achieve growth in construction services revenues and operating earnings 

table of contents in fiscal year  we consummated the tax free spin offs to our stockholders of substantially all of our manufactured housing operations in june and our entire ownership interest in eagle materials inc  formerly known as centex construction products  inc  a former majority owned subsidiary which we referred to as construction products  on january  manufactured housing and construction products are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements

we define a neighborhood as an individual active selling location targeted to a specific buyer segment 
for the year ended march   we opened neighborhoods and closed out of neighborhoods  driving our average operating neighborhoods to  a increase over the prior year 
higher sales rates continue to contribute to our growth in closings per average neighborhood 
sales per average neighborhood were for the year ended march   a increase over the prior year 
this sales rate increase can be attributed to our continued focus on market research  enhanced sales and marketing activities and activity based sales management 
sales orders increased in each of our geographic regions in fiscal year  and sales growth rates were particularly strong in the mid atlantic and west coast regions  which achieved increases over the prior year of and  respectively 
for all regions  sales orders totaled  units for the year ended march   an increase of versus the prior year 
the increase in sales per average neighborhood  as well as the increase in average operating neighborhoods  resulted in an increase of home closing volume of to  homes for the year ended march   as compared to the prior year 
current housing market conditions  combined with our geographic  product and segment diversification strategies  continued to drive higher average selling prices 
for the year ended march   average selling prices were up to  as compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to strong demand in the southeast and west coast regions resulting in pricing power  as well as a greater mix of homes closed in the west coast region 
california continues to experience the largest average sales price increase among the states in which we operate as average prices rose to  a  increase over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased at a slightly higher rate than revenues for the year ended march  primarily due to increases in employee count to support planned neighborhood growth and increased incentive compensation reflective of the growth in operating earnings 
operating margins consisting of operating earnings as a percentage of revenues for home building s domestic operations improved to for the year ended march   compared to for the year ended march  increased unit volume  increases in average unit selling price  continued focus on lowering direct construction costs  increased land sales  improved margin on land sales  and earnings from joint ventures resulted in margin improvement throughout home building s domestic operations 
national and regional purchasing programs and local cost reduction and efficiency efforts have helped partially offset 
table of contents increasing raw material costs experienced throughout the year 
we purchase materials  services and land from numerous sources  and during the past twelve months have been able to deal effectively with the challenges we have experienced relating to the supply or availability of materials  services and land 
the above factors contributed to the improvement in our operating earnings  which is reflective of our continued focus on our quality growth strategy  consisting of growing revenue and earnings while improving margins 
during the year  we continued to increase our land position to facilitate our short and longer term growth initiatives 
our total land position owned or controlled under option agreements at march  will provide land for approximately of closings for fiscal year  of closings for fiscal year  and of closings for fiscal year based on our current closing projections

table of contents difference between interest revenue on mortgage loans held for sale and interest expense on debt used to fund the mortgage loans 
our business strategy of selling prime loans reduces our capital investment and related risks  provides substantial cash flow and is an efficient process given the size and liquidity of the prime mortgage loan secondary capital markets 
ctx mortgage company  llc originates mortgage loans and sells them to hsf i and investors 
hsf i is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary and  as of july   it was consolidated with our financial services segment

for the year ended march   ctx mortgage company  llc originated of the non cash unit closings of home building s customers  versus for the prior year

any significant increase in mortgage interest rates above current prevailing levels could affect the ability or willingness of prospective homebuyers to finance home purchases and or curtail mortgage refinance activity 
although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful  we will seek to mitigate the effects of any increase in mortgage interest rates by increasing our market share by adding loan officers and improving their productivity while at the same time seek to improve our operating leverage 

table of contents sub prime home equity lending the following summarizes the results of our sub prime home equity lending operations for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change revenues cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses loan loss provision operating earnings interest margin average interest earning assets average yield nm nm average interest bearing liabilities average rate paid nm nm the revenues of home equity increased primarily as a result of continued growth in our portfolio of residential mortgage loans held for investment and as a result of a program of whole loan sales to third parties 
our portfolio growth translated into more interest income  our largest component of revenue 
home equity recorded approximately million in net revenue and operating earnings related to the whole loan sales for the year ended march  whole loan sales have the effect of increasing current revenues but decreasing future interest margin that would have been recognized had the loans been securitized or retained as inventory 
the estimated net impact on operating earnings from resulting gain on sale treatment was approximately million 
a program of whole loan sales is a component of home equity s diversification of funding sources and provides more efficient utilization of capital 
cost of sales is comprised of interest expense  which increased in fiscal year commensurate with increases in our average debt outstanding and increases in interest rates since the prior year 
operating expenses for the year ended march  increased as a result of home equity s continued growth 
the increase in loan production volume  the expansion of branch offices and the increase in the number of employees led to a corresponding increase in salaries and related costs  rent expense  group insurance costs and advertising expenditures 
the increase in the loan loss provision for the year ended march  occurred primarily because of the increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment 
also  as the portfolio continues to mature and grow  we expect the provision for losses  the loans charged off and the allowance for losses to continue to increase 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policy and methodology for establishing the provision for losses  see critical accounting estimates valuation of residential mortgage loans held for investment 
changes in the allowance for losses are included in note b  residential mortgage loans held for investment  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
the increase in operating earnings for the year ended march  is primarily attributable to the increase in interest margin  which we define as the difference between interest revenue on mortgage loans held for sale or investment and interest expense on debt used to fund the mortgage loans 
interest margin for the year ended march  increased primarily as a result of an increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans held 
table of contents for investment 
in the current year  interest margin as a percentage of revenues has decreased primarily as a result of an increasing interest rate environment  as well as increased competitive industry conditions 
whole loan sale transactions also contributed to the increase in operating earnings for the year ended march  average interest earning assets and liabilities for the year ended march  increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of loan originations and an increase in average loan size see table below 
the following table provides a comparative analysis of mortgage loan originations and applications for the two year period ended march  for the years ended march  change change origination volume in millions number of loans originated number of loan applications average loan size the increase in origination volume was due to an increase in the average loan size and an increase in the overall sales force  which resulted in an increase in the number of loan applications received 
the following summarizes home equity s portfolio of mortgage loans  classified by the securitization structure used  as of march  and for the years ended march  change change servicing portfolio number of loans portfolio accounting method serviced for others total dollars in billions portfolio accounting method serviced for others total home equity periodically securitizes its inventory of mortgage loan originations or engages in whole loan sales in order to provide funding for its mortgage operations 
the majority of home equity s servicing portfolio is accounted for using the portfolio accounting method in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  where loan originations are securitized and accounted for as borrowings  interest income is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest actuarial method  the mortgage loans receivable and the securitization debt asset backed certificates remain on home equity s balance sheet  and the related interest margin is reflected in the income statement 
this structure of securitizations has been utilized since april  another component of home equity s servicing portfolio includes securitizations accounted for as gain on sale in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets 
table of contents and extinguishments of liabilities  where from october through march  an estimate of the entire gain resulting from the sale was included in earnings during the period in which the securitization transaction occurred 
this is referred to as the gain on sale method and is included in the serviced for others category in the above table 
unlike the portfolio accounting method  our balance sheet does not reflect the mortgage loans receivable or the offsetting debt resulting from these securitizations 
however  under the gain on sale method  home equity s retained residual interest in  as well as the servicing rights to  the securitized loans are reflected on the balance sheet 
home equity carries msri at fair value on the balance sheet 
the serviced for others category of home equity s servicing portfolio also includes loans sold on a whole loan servicing retained basis 
home equity continues to service these loans  which resulted in a million servicing asset recorded  based on the present value of estimated future cash flows as of march  for the year ended march   home equity s whole loan sales on a servicing retained basis totaled million 
no such sales occurred during fiscal year the structure of home equity s securitizations has no effect on the ultimate amount of profit and cash flow recognized over the life of the mortgages 
however  the structure does affect the timing of profit recognition 
under both structures  recourse on the securitized debt is limited to the payments received on the underlying mortgage collateral with no recourse to home equity or centex corporation 
as is common in these structures  home equity remains liable for customary loan representations 
the primary risks in home equity s operations are consistent with those of the financial services industry and include credit risk associated with its loans  liquidity risk related to funding its loans and interest rate risk prior to securitization of the loans 
although the volume of originations in our home equity operations is less sensitive to increases in interest rates than ctx mortgage company  llc and its related companies  interest rate increases generally result in decreased interest margins 
in addition  it is also subject to prepayment risks principal reductions in excess of contractually scheduled reductions associated with loans securitized prior to april for additional information on home equity s msri  see note a  significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this report

revenue increases are due to an increase in the number of active projects and an increase in average contract size 
as of march   we had active projects  which represents a increase over the prior year 
the construction services industry continues to experience pricing pressure  however  industry conditions are improving 
the increase in new contracts executed and backlog of uncompleted contracts was 
table of contents primarily due to the execution of contracts for multi unit residential projects

in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we took a charge of million to notes receivable received in connection with the sale of our security monitoring center in fiscal year the fluctuations in our investment real estate division s operating earnings were primarily related to the timing of property sales 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent corporate employee compensation and other corporate costs such as investor communications  insurance  rent and professional services 
the decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses in fiscal year is primarily related to million in incremental executive compensation costs recorded in the prior year for the retirement of an executive officer 
for the year ended march  and  interest costs include interest expense of million and million  respectively  and previously capitalized interest included in home building s costs and expenses of million and million  respectively 
total interest costs  excluding financial services interest expense  were million and million for the year ended march  and  respectively

our record fourth quarter sales resulted in some existing neighborhoods being closed out ie  all remaining units sold earlier than anticipated 
in addition  to maximize our pricing opportunities  we delayed the opening of other neighborhoods 
the increase in closings per average neighborhood in fiscal was the result of higher sales rates due to our continued focus on market research  activity based sales management and internet marketing 
sales orders for the year were strong across all of our operating regions and totaled  units  an increase of versus the prior year

the increase in home equity s operating earnings is primarily the result of the increase in interest margin  as noted above 
interest income will be positively affected as the portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment increases and matures

the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in the provision for loan losses 
the increase in the provision for losses in fiscal occurred primarily because the amount of the residential mortgage loans held for investment increased and the residential mortgage loan portfolio continued to mature

in addition  in fiscal  construction services 
table of contents recorded a project loss of million related to the construction of a distribution facility and incurred approximately million of costs associated with its decision to exit the pharmaceutical and industrial construction markets 
the increases in new contracts executed and backlog of uncompleted contracts were the result of our strategy to increase market share by focusing on key geographic markets and certain industry markets 
construction services has also been awarded work that is pending execution of a signed contract 
at march  and  such work  which is not included in backlog  was approximately billion and billion  respectively 
there is no assurance that this awarded work will result in future revenues 
other our other segment includes our home services operations  investment real estate operations  corporate general and administrative expense and interest expense 
in june  we spun off tax free substantially all of our investment in manufactured housing operations  which had previously been included in the other segment 
as a result of the spin off  manufactured housing operations are reflected as a discontinued operation and not included in the segment information below 
as described in item business  the company acquired holding and the partnership in february subsequent to the merger  the company has consolidated the financial results of the partnership 
as a result  the company has realigned its reporting for the partnership  such that the partnership s international homebuilding operations are included in the home building business segment 
the partnership s domestic operations continue to be reported within our investment real estate operations 
the company has determined that no significant capital will be allocated to our investment real estate operations for new business development 
beginning april   the financial results of our investment real estate operations are included in the other business segment 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
other consisted of the following dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change operating loss from home services operations operating earnings from investment real estate operations corporate general and administrative expense interest expense other operating loss the decrease in our home services division s operating loss in fiscal was primarily due to an million provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce the carrying value of its remaining home security monitoring assets to estimated fair value 
our home services operations sold substantially all of its remaining security monitoring assets in fiscal the sale of these operations did not have a material effect on home services operating loss in fiscal the changes in operating earnings of our investment real estate operations were primarily related to the timing of property sales 
property sales contributed operating earnings of million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  the timing of sales is uncertain and can vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents corporate general and administrative expenses represent corporate employee compensation and other corporate costs such as investor communications  insurance  rent and professional services 
the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses is primarily related to compensation increases reflective of additional personnel to support the growth in our operations and higher performance related compensation levels due to the expensing of stock options and increases in our earnings and returns 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded an incremental million in employee compensation related to acceleration of certain executive compensation costs for the march  retirement of an executive officer 
total interest costs  including interest expensed and relieved to home building s costs and expenses and excluding interest to financial services  for the years ended march  and  were million and million  respectively 
the increase in total interest costs is primarily related to an increase in average debt outstanding for the fiscal year  as compared to the prior year 
this increase is offset by slightly lower borrowing costs in the fiscal year  as compared to the prior year 
for additional discussion of interest costs  see note a  significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
our effective tax rate related to continuing operations increased to from in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during fiscal compared to fiscal discontinued operations in june  we spun off tax free to our stockholders substantially all of our manufactured housing operations  and in january  we spun off tax free to our stockholders our entire equity interest in construction products 
as a result of the spin offs  the earnings from these operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated earnings 
all prior period information related to these discontinued operations has been reclassified to be consistent with the march  presentation 
for the years ended march  and  discontinued operations had revenues of million and million and operating earnings of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the tax free distribution of our interests in construction products  we recognized  as a component of discontinued operations  a tax benefit of million 
the tax benefit is a result of the reversal of a deferred tax liability for the difference between the financial carrying amount of our investment in construction products and the respective tax basis  which was no longer required given the tax free nature of the distribution 
in connection with the spin offs  we recorded a dividend to stockholders of million representing our net investments in manufactured housing operations and construction products on the respective spin off dates

we believe that separate disclosure of the consolidating information is useful because the financial services subsidiaries operate in a distinctly different financial environment that generally requires significantly less equity to support their higher debt levels compared to the operations of our other subsidiaries  the financial services subsidiaries have structured their financing programs substantially on a stand alone basis  and centex has limited obligations with respect to the indebtedness of our financial services subsidiaries 
management uses this information in its financial and strategic planning 
we also use this presentation to allow investors to compare us to homebuilders that do not have financial services operations 
we generally fund our centex operating and other short term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations  borrowings from commercial paper and the issuance of senior debt 
centex s operating cash is derived primarily through home and land sales from our home building segment and general contracting fees obtained through our construction services segment 
during fiscal  cash was primarily used in centex s operating activities to finance increases in home building inventories relating to the increased level of sales and resulting units under construction during the year  and for the acquisition of land held for development 
the funds provided by centex s financing activities were primarily from debt issued to fund the increased homebuilding activity 
we generally fund our financial services operating and other short term liquidity needs through securitizations  committed credit facilities  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans to investors and cash flows from operations

financial services long term debt associated with home equity includes asset backed certificates related to securitized residential mortgage loans structured as collateralized borrowings 
the principal and interest on these certificates are paid from the liquidation of the underlying residential mortgage loans  which serve as collateral for the debt 
accordingly  the timing of the principal payments on these certificates is dependent upon the payments received on the underlying residential mortgage loans 
the contractual obligations of this component of long term debt are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected prepayments 
our contractual obligations will be funded in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows and through our credit facilities 
centex corporation currently has an investment grade credit rating from each of the principal credit rating agencies

table of contents certain off balance sheet obligations the following is a summary of certain off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations and their possible effects on our liquidity and capital resources 
joint ventures we conduct a portion of our land acquisition  development and other activities through our participation in joint ventures in which we hold less than a majority equity interest 
these land related activities typically require substantial capital  and partnering with other developers allows home building to share the risks and rewards of ownership while providing for efficient asset utilization 
our investment in these non consolidated joint ventures was million and million at march  and  respectively 
these joint ventures had total outstanding secured land acquisition and development debt of approximately million and million at march  and  respectively 
we are liable  on a contingent basis  through limited guarantees  letters of credit or other arrangements  with respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and development debt of certain of the joint ventures  which we refer to as the recourse joint ventures 
our maximum potential liability with respect to the debt of the recourse joint ventures  based on our ownership percentage of the recourse joint ventures  is approximately million and million at march  and march   respectively 
for certain of the joint ventures  we have also guaranteed the completion of the project by the joint ventures and agreed to indemnify the construction lender for certain environmental liabilities with respect to the project 
for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our accounting for transactions with non consolidated joint ventures  see recent accounting pronouncements of this report 
critical accounting estimates some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  however  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with members of the audit committee 
impairment of long lived assets housing projects and land held for development and sale are stated at the lower of cost including direct construction costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes or fair value less cost to sell 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we assess these assets for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no significant impairments of long lived assets were recorded in fiscal  or goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired 
see note e  goodwill  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of the changes in goodwill by segment 
we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 effective april  upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment conducted as of january  at the reporting unit level  by applying a fair value based test 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment has occurred 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow or market valuation approach 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if the goodwill is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value 
we had no impairment of goodwill in fiscal  or inventory valuation housing projects and land held for development and sale are stated at the lower of cost including direct construction costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes or fair value less cost to sell 
home construction costs are accumulated on a specific identification basis 
under the specific identification basis  costs and expenses includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs 
construction costs for homes closed includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home  plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid  based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs 
land acquisition and development costs are estimated based on the total costs expected in a project 
any changes to the estimated total development costs identified subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated to the remaining homes in the project 
land held for development and sale includes the cost of land purchased for development  deposits for land purchases and related acquisition costs 
a liability has been established based on our historical experience  to anticipate that some of the amounts capitalized as land and land development cost will not ultimately be acquired 
when it is probable that the land will not be acquired  the deposit and related acquisition costs are charged to the liability 
land held under option agreements not owned in order to ensure the future availability of land for homebuilding  the company enters into lot option purchase agreements with unaffiliated third parties 
under the option agreements  the company pays a stated deposit in consideration for the right to purchase land at a future time  usually at predetermined prices 
these options generally do not contain performance requirements from the company nor obligate the company to purchase the land 
the company has evaluated those entities with which we entered into lot option agreements in accordance with the provisions of fin the provisions of fin require the company to consolidate the financial results of a variable interest entity if the company is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
variable interest entities are entities in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest and or the entity is unable to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the owner or investor that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns 
the company determines if it is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity 
expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity are highly dependent upon management s estimates of the variability and probabilities of future land prices  the probabilities of expected cash flows and entitlement risks related to the underlying land  among other factors 
based on this evaluation  if the company is the primary beneficiary of those entities with which we have entered into lot option agreements  the variable interest entity is consolidated 

table of contents for purposes of consolidation  to the extent financial statements are available  the company consolidates the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity 
if financial statements for the variable interest entity are not available  the company records the remaining purchase price of land in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  land held under option agreements not owned  with a corresponding increase in minority interests 
lot option deposits related to these options are also reclassified to land held under option agreements not owned 
to the extent we do not exercise our option to purchase such land  the amount of the lot option deposit and any letters of credit represent our maximum exposure to loss 
see note i  land held under option agreements not owned and other land deposits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for further discussion on the results of our analysis of lot option agreements 
valuation of residential mortgage loans held for investment home equity originates and purchases loans in accordance with standard underwriting criteria 
the underwriting standards are primarily intended to assess the creditworthiness of the mortgagee  the value of the mortgaged property and the adequacy of the property as collateral for the home equity loan 
home equity establishes an allowance for losses by recording a provision for losses in the statement of consolidated earnings when it believes a loss has occurred 
when home equity determines that a residential mortgage loan held for investment is partially or fully uncollectible  the estimated loss is charged against the allowance for losses 
recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance at the time the recovery is collected 
we evaluate the allowance on an aggregate basis considering  among other things  the relationship of the allowance to the amount of residential mortgage loans held for investment and historical credit losses 
the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
a range of expected credit losses is estimated using historical losses  static pool loss curves and delinquency modeling 
these tools take into consideration historical information regarding delinquency and loss severity experience and apply that information to the portfolio at each reporting date 
although we consider the allowance for losses on residential mortgage loans held for investment reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
this allowance may prove to be insufficient due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries 
see note c  allowance for losses on residential mortgage loans held for investment  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for a discussion of the changes in the allowance for losses 
mortgage securitization residual interest home equity uses mortgage securitizations to finance its mortgage loan portfolio 
for securitizations prior to april  which home equity accounted for as sales  home equity retained a msri 
the msri represents the present value of home equity s right to receive  over the life of the securitization  the excess of the weighted average coupon on the loans securitized over the interest rates on the securities sold  a normal servicing fee  a trustee fee and an insurance fee  where applicable  net of the credit losses relating to the loans securitized 
home equity estimates the fair value of msri through the application of discounted cash flow analysis 
such analysis requires the use of various assumptions  the most significant of which are anticipated prepayments principal reductions in excess of contractually scheduled reductions  estimated future credit losses and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
see note a  significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for a discussion of the sensitivity of the msri to changes in the assumptions 

table of contents loan origination reserve ctx mortgage company  llc has established a liability for anticipated losses associated with loans originated based upon  among other factors  historical loss rates and current trends in loan originations 
this liability includes losses associated with certain borrower payment defaults  credit quality issues  or misrepresentation and reflects management s judgment of the loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
although we consider the loan origination reserve reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at march  to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations 
this reserve may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries 
warranty accruals home building offers a ten year limited warranty for most homes constructed and sold in the united states and in the united kingdom 
the warranty covers defects in materials or workmanship in the first two years of the home and certain designated components or structural elements of the home in the third through tenth years 
in california  effective january   home building began following the statutory provisions of senate bill  which in part provides a statutory warranty to customers and a statutory dispute resolution process 
home building estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty program for which it will be responsible and records a liability at the time each home is closed 
factors that affect home building s warranty liability include the number of homes closed  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
home building periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the warranty accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
insurance accruals we have certain deductible limits under our workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance policies for which reserves are actuarially determined based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses concerning these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to factors such as claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations  among others 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our insurance accruals and adjust the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
entitled share based payment  or sfas r 
share based payments are transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees  but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model 
sfas r supersedes apb no

when fully phased in  the deduction 
table of contents will be up to of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
fsp clarifies that the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under fasb no 
and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods during which the amounts are deductible on the tax return 
although this provision does not impact the fiscal year financial statements  the company believes the new deduction for qualified domestic production activities will likely result in a benefit to the company s financial statements in future periods 
the company is currently quantifying the potential benefit of this provision

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our direct debt obligations  on mortgage loans receivable  residual interest in mortgage securitizations and securitizations classified as debt 
the following analysis provides a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of march  we have utilized derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage the outstanding debt that is subject to changes in interest rates 
as of march   we had interest rate swap agreements that in effect converted billion of our variable rate debt outstanding into fixed rate debt 
we recognize amounts paid or received under interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense 
financial services  through ctx mortgage company  llc and its related companies  enters into interest rate lock commitments  or irlcs with its customers under which ctx mortgage company  llc and its related companies agree to make mortgage loans at agreed upon rates within a period of time  generally from to days  if certain conditions are met 
initially  the irlcs are treated as derivative instruments and their fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the irlcs are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to hedge the interest rate risk related to its irlcs  ctx mortgage company  llc and its related companies execute mandatory forward trade commitments  or forward trade commitments 
these forward trade commitments are not designated as hedges  and their fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these forward trade commitments are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
financial services originates  sells and securitizes conforming and nonconforming a mortgages  sub prime first and second mortgages and home equity loans 
since december  substantially all conforming 
table of contents and jumbo a mortgages have been sold to hsf i at or near the date on which the loans were funded 
ctx mortgage company  llc and its related companies also execute forward trade commitments to hedge the interest rate risk related to its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale  including mortgage loans held by hsf i 
these forward trade commitments have been designated as fair value hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the forward trade commitments and the mortgage loans  for which the hedge relationship is deemed effective  are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to the extent the hedge is effective  gains or losses in the value of the hedged loans due to interest rate movement will be offset by an equal and opposite gain or loss in the value of the forward trade commitment 
this will result in net zero impact to earnings 
to the extent the hedge contains some ineffectiveness  the ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings 
due to the high degree of liquidity in the a mortgage market and the frequency of loan sales and securitizations  the use of forward sales is an effective economic hedge against changes in market value of both irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale that result from changes in interest rates 
home equity uses interest rate swaps to hedge the market risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate securitization debt used to finance sub prime mortgages 
home equity will generally hold mortgages in anticipation of securitization for up to days 
home equity also uses interest rate swaps  included in the billion balance stated above that  in effect  fix the interest rate on its variable interest rate debt 
as of march   our total msri was million  which consists of million remaining on loans securitized from october to march accounted for as gain on sale  million related to an acquisition in fiscal  and million related to loans sold in fiscal year to a government sponsored enterprise that we continue to service 
we continually monitor the fair value of the msri and review the factors expected to influence the future constant prepayment rate  or cpr  discount rates and credit losses 
in developing assumptions regarding expected future cpr  we consider a variety of factors  many of which are interrelated 
these factors include historical performance  origination channels  characteristics of borrowers  such as credit quality and loan to value relationships  and market factors that influence competition 
if changes in assumptions regarding future cpr  discount rates or credit losses are necessary  the msri fair value is adjusted accordingly 
our international homebuilding operations are located in the united kingdom 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in the foreign currency exchange rate or weak economic conditions in our markets 
our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk is approximately million as of march  we use both short term and long term debt in our financing strategy 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay any of our fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
as of march   short term debt was billion  most of which was applicable to financial services 
the majority of financial services debt is collateralized by residential mortgage loans 
we borrow on a short term basis in the commercial paper market under a million commercial paper program supported by an million revolving credit facility with a term expiring in fiscal year  all of which bear interest at prevailing market rates 
the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings outstanding at march  was
