general we are in the business of marketing and distributing safety and security products which are primarily manufactured through our owned hong kong joint venture 
our financial statements detail our sales and other operational results only  and report the financial results of the hong kong joint venture using the equity method 
accordingly  the following discussion and analysis of the fiscal years ended march   and relate to the operational results of the company only 
a discussion and analysis of the hong kong joint venture s operational results for these periods is presented below under the heading hong kong joint venture 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended march   and sales 
in fiscal year  our net sales increased by   from  in fiscal to  in fiscal we experienced an increase of approximately  in sales to the company s retail and wholesale distribution customers over the prior year principally as a result of increased volume 
our focus on marketing to the electrical distribution trade through our usi electric subsidiary generated an increase in sales  also principally due to increased volume  to this market of approximately  from approximately  in to approximately  in 
we anticipate continued revenue growth in all our markets 
in fiscal year  sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal our focus on marketing to retailers  including the wholesale distribution trades  generated the majority of the increase 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales or gross margin in fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in the fiscal year ended march  reflects higher costs and pricing concessions applied to meet competitive pressures 
the increase in gross margin for the year ended march  resulted from increased productivity and efficiency 
during fiscal we were able to increase gross margins by increasing sales 
since fixed costs did not increase at the same rate as sales  the gross margin percentage as a percent of sales increased as sales increased 
management does not anticipate a near term need to increase fixed costs 
expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales is attributable to costs that do not increase proportionately with the higher sales volume 
various expense categories contributed to the increased dollar amount of the expense  but the following major account classifications were significant factors in this dollar increase i commissions and freight charges  as a percentage of sales  while consistent with commissions and freight charges of the prior year  vary directly with sales volume 
therefore  of the  increase in expenses   is attributable to commissions and freight charges from higher sales volume during the period 
ii professional fees increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended march  costs associated with the kovens litigation discussed under item  legal proceedings  were approximately  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
professional fees associated with the patent litigation decreased by approximately  to approximately  for the fiscal year ended march  professional fees associated with patent litigation for the period were reduced by insurance reimbursements 
the company believes that professional fees will continue at increased levels until outstanding litigation matters are resolved 
in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately   from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal and in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales was due to increased sales commissions and freight  and higher legal costs partly associated with defending the suits described under item  legal proceedings 
these increases were partially offset by a net gain of  from the sale of a acre parcel of land during the second quarter of fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal primarily due to higher interest rates 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates and lower levels of debt 
income taxes 
we did not make a provision for federal income taxes in each of the  and fiscal years  due to our operating loss carryforward for income tax purposes 
however  we made a provision of  and  for state income taxes for fiscal year and  respectively 
the valuation allowance previously established to offset tax benefits associated with our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets was reduced during the fourth quarter by  resulting in a net income tax benefit of  the valuation allowance is heavily influenced by historical results of operations and management believes recent operating results support the recognition of a portion of the income tax benefits associated with realization of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the remaining valuation allowance of  which offsets future tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets until circumstances indicate the allowance is no longer required 
net income 
we reported net income of  for fiscal year compared to a net income of  for fiscal year  a  increase 
this increase in net income resulted from both higher gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses as described above  and higher hong kong joint venture earnings and the income tax benefit of  arising principally from the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
we reported net income of  for fiscal year compared to a net income of  for fiscal year  a  increase 
this increase in net income resulted from both higher hong kong joint venture earnings and higher gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses as described above 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are currently met by funds generated from operations and from our factoring agreement  which supplies both short term borrowings and letters of credit to finance foreign inventory purchases 
the maximum we may borrow under this agreement is  however  based on specified percentages of our accounts receivable and inventory and letter of credit commitments  at march   our maximum borrowing amount was limited to  all of which was available under this agreement as of march  the outstanding principal balance under this agreement is payable upon demand 
the interest rate on the factoring agreement  on the uncollected factored accounts receivable and any additional borrowings is equal to the prime rate of interest charged by the factor which  as of march   was 
the borrowings are collateralized by all our accounts receivable and inventory 
during the year ended march   working capital computed as the excess of current assets over current liabilities increased by  from  on march   to  on march  our operating activities used cash of  for the year ended march  for the fiscal year ended march   operating activities used cash of  this increase of  was primarily due to higher levels of accounts receivable and undistributed joint venture earnings partially offset by higher net income 
our investing activities provided cash of  during fiscal and provided cash of  during fiscal this increase resulted primarily from higher distributions from the joint venture

the company offset  during fiscal and  during fiscal of trade amounts due by it to the hong kong joint venture in lieu of cash distributions 
the company records these payments as a non cash transaction in its statement of cash flows

net income was  for fiscal year compared to net income of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in the current fiscal year is primarily attributable to higher gross margins due to price increases instituted during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in income for the year ended march  was due primarily to lower gross margins due to competition and higher manufacturing costs 
gross margins of the hong kong joint venture for fiscal increased to from in the prior fiscal year

contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents  as of march   our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in note e to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to march   the company exercised its option to extend the operating lease on its corporate offices until october payment due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations    critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statement included as part of this document 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application on these and other accounting policies see note a to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements issued by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we established allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts based upon historical experience 
inventories are valued at the lower of market or cost 
cost is determined on the first in first out method 
we have recorded a reserve for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management reviews the reserve quarterly 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
we have provided a valuation allowance on future tax benefits such as foreign tax credits  foreign net operating losses  capital losses and net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses and losses in recent years 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
as a result of management s assessment  the valuation allowance was reduced by  resulting in a net income tax benefit of  recognized in the fourth quarter and for the year ended march  as a result  an allowance of  continues to be provided to offset tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets at march  we are subject to lawsuits and other claims  related to patents and other matters 
management is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for the classification of certain financial instruments as a liability or an asset in some circumstances whereas many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the provisions of fas are generally effective for such instruments entered into or modified after may  for the fiscal years ended march   and  we have not issued any financial instruments which have the characteristics within the scope of or that are within the requirements of fas in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
the effective date of fasb r is for interim and annual periods beginning after june  subsequently  the securities and exchange commission sec approved a rule which delays the effective date of fas r for certain public companies 
under the sec s rule  fas r is now effective for the company s annual period beginning april  we have elected to defer adoption of the change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the recordation of such amounts as charges to operating expense until the annual period beginning april  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal financial instrument is our factoring agreement which provides for interest at the factor s prime rate at march  
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by us under our factoring agreement 
a significant rise in the prime rate could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
at march   we had  principal outstanding under the facility 
if principal amounts outstanding under our factoring agreement remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by  we would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest in that year 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose
