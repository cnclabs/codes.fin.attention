item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of our operations for the years ended december   and the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
overview cardinal financial corporation cardinal  a locally owned and managed financial holding company headquartered in tysons corner  virginia  is committed to providing superior customer service  a diversified mix of financial products and services  and convenient banking to our retail and business consumers 
we own cardinal bank  a state chartered community bank  and cardinal wealth services  inc  an investment services subsidiary 
through these two subsidiaries and george mason  a subsidiary of cardinal bank  we offer a wide range of banking products and services to both our commercial and retail customers 
our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting loan and depository relationships with small and medium sized businesses as well as commercial real estate developers  builders  and professionals such as physicians  accountants and attorneys 
we have nineteen retail branch locations and provide competitive retail products and services 
we complement our core banking operations by offering investment products and services to our customers through our third party brokerage relationship with raymond james financial services  inc on july   we acquired george mason from united bank virginia  a wholly owned subsidiary of united bankshares  inc in a cash transaction for million 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and george mason s assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the purchase date 
george mason s operating results are included in the consolidated results since the date of the acquisition 
george mason  based in fairfax  virginia  engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through nine branches located throughout the metropolitan washington region 
george mason has approximately employees and does business in eight states  including virginia  maryland and the district of columbia 
george mason is one of the significant residential mortgage originators in the greater washington metropolitan area  reporting originations of over billion in and billion in george mason s primary sources of revenue include net interest income earned on loans held for sale  gain on the sale of loans held for sale and contractual management fees earned relating to the management of other entities activities 
loans are made pursuant to purchase commitments and are sold servicing released 
in july  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cardinal statutory trust i  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are due in and have an interest rate of libor london interbank offered rate plus  which adjusts quarterly 
these securities are redeemable at a premium through march and at par thereafter 
the company has guaranteed payment of these securities 
the million payable by the company to cardinal statutory trust i is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since cardinal statutory trust i is an unconsolidated subsidiary as the company is not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
the company utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the bank 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk to maximize  and concurrently stabilize  net interest income 
we do this by monitoring the spread between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it 
in addition to management of interest rate risk  we analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk 
risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry  and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by carefully underwriting and monitoring our extensions of credit 
in addition to net interest income  non interest income is an increasingly important source of income for us and includes service charges on deposits and loans  investment fee income  gains on sales on investment securities available for sale  gains on sale of loans held for sale and management fee income 
our acquisition of george mason in july has resulted in non interest income becoming a larger component of our total revenues 
net interest income and non interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue for the three years ended december  net interest income non interest income we anticipate that non interest income will be a larger percentage of our total revenue in than it was in since we will have owned george mason for a full year in compared to a half year in our business strategy is to grow through geographic expansion while maintaining strong asset quality and achieving sustained profitability 
we completed a secondary common stock offering that raised million in capital in december and an additional million in capital following the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in january this capital is being used to support the continuing expansion of our branch office network and balance sheet growth 
as a result of this increased capital and retained earnings  we increased our legal lending limit to million as of december   which allows us to more quickly expand our commercial and real estate lending loan portfolios 
we expect to increase our loan to deposit ratio and shift the mix of our earning assets to higher yielding loans 
we used million of the cash that was raised in december and january to acquire george mason 
george mason adds to our plans to increase our selection of banking products and financial services and diversify our revenue base  increase fee income  and strengthen customer relationships 
risks factors we have operated at a cumulative loss since our inception 
we have operated at a cumulative loss since our organization in while we reported net income of million in and million in  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to operate at a profit as we continue to grow 
we may not be able to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during the last five years  we have experienced significant growth  and a key aspect of our business strategy is our continued growth and expansion 
our ability to continue to grow depends  in part  upon our ability to open new branch offices or acquire existing branches or other financial institutions  attract deposits to those locations  and identify attractive loan and investment opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify attractive markets  locations or opportunities to expand in the future 
our ability to manage our growth successfully also will depend on whether we can maintain capital levels adequate to support our growth and maintain cost controls and asset quality 
as we continue to implement our growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or other banks  we expect to incur increased personnel  occupancy and other operating expenses 
in the case of new branches  we must absorb those higher expenses while we begin to generate new deposits  and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets 
thus  our plans to branch aggressively could depress our earnings in the short run  even if we efficiently execute our branching strategy 
we rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations  we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
we are a customer focused and relationship driven organization 
we expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our customers by our chairman  president and chief executive officer  bernard h 
clineburg  and our other executive and senior lending officers 
we have entered into employment agreements with mr 
clineburg and three other executive officers 
the existence of such agreements  however  does not necessarily assure that we will be able to continue to retain their services 
the unexpected loss of mr 
clineburg or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executives 
the implementation of our business strategy will also require us to continue to attract  hire  motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services 
many experienced banking professionals employed by our competitors are covered by agreements not to compete or solicit their existing customers if they were to leave their current employment 
these agreements make the recruitment of these professionals more difficult 
the market for these people is competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting  hiring  motivating or retaining them 
we may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk 
our profitability will depend in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and interest rates paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
we may pay above market rates to attract deposits as we have done in some of our marketing promotions in the past 
changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but we will be unable to eliminate it 
our net interest spread will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control  including competition  federal economic  monetary and fiscal policies  and economic conditions generally 
we may be adversely affected by economic conditions in our market area 
we are headquartered in northern virginia  and our market includes the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
because our lending is concentrated in this market  we will be affected by the general economic conditions in the greater washington area  which may be impacted by the level of federal government spending 
changes in the economy  and government spending in particular  may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits  the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and the demand for banking products and services generally could negatively affect our financial condition and performance 
in recent years  there has been a proliferation of technology and communications businesses in our market area 
the recent economic recession and the downturn in those industries have had a significant adverse impact on a number of those businesses 
although we do not have significant credit exposure to these businesses  the downturn in these industries could have a negative impact on local economic conditions and real estate collateral values generally  which could negatively affect our profitability 
our concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase our credit losses  which would negatively affect our financial results 
we offer a variety of secured loans  including commercial lines of credit  commercial term loans  real estate  construction  home equity  consumer and other loans 
many of our loans are secured by real estate both residential and commercial in our market area 
a major change in the real estate market  such as a deterioration in the value of this collateral  or in the local or national economy  could adversely affect our customers ability to pay these loans  which in turn could impact us 
risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry  and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by monitoring our extensions of credit carefully 
we cannot fully eliminate credit risk  and as a result credit losses may occur in the future 
if our allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio  management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions  credit quality of the loan portfolio  the collateral supporting the loans and performance of our customers relative to their financial obligations with us 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that may be beyond our control  and these losses may exceed our current estimates 
rapidly growing loan portfolios are  by their nature  unseasoned 
as a result  estimating loan loss allowances is more difficult  and may be more susceptible to changes in estimates  and to losses exceeding estimates  than more seasoned portfolios 
although we believe the allowance for loan losses is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio  we cannot fully predict such losses or that our loan loss allowance will be adequate in the future 
excessive loan losses could have a material impact on our financial performance 
federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of our management 
any increase in the amount of our provision or loans charged off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results 
our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry 
we face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions  including savings and loan associates  savings banks  finance companies and credit unions for deposits  loans and other financial services in our market area 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources  as well as larger lending limits and branch systems  and offer a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can 
many of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us 
as a result  these nonbank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our profitability and the value of your investment may suffer because of rapid and unpredictable changes in the highly regulated environment in which we operate 
we are subject to extensive supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels 
recently enacted  proposed and future banking legislation and regulations have had  and will continue to have  or may have a significant impact on the financial services industry 
these regulations  which are intended to protect depositors and not our shareholders  and the interpretation and application of them by federal and state regulators  are beyond our control  may change rapidly and unpredictably and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth 
our success depends on our continued ability to maintain compliance with these regulations 
some of these regulations may increase our costs and thus place other financial institutions who are not subject to similar regulation in stronger  more favorable competitive positions 
if we need additional capital in the future to continue our growth  we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable 
this could negatively affect our performance and the value of our common stock 
our business strategy calls for continued growth 
we anticipate that we will be able to support this growth through the generation of additional deposits at new branch locations as well as investment opportunities 
however  we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our capital levels 
our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the condition of financial markets at that time 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital in the amounts or on terms satisfactory to us 
our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed 
off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business we issue loan commitments  stand by letters of credit and enter into guarantees which are not reflected in the consolidated statements of condition 
such arrangements could expose us to additional risk of loss 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
caution about forward looking statements we make certain forward looking statements in this form k that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include statements regarding our profitability  liquidity  allowance for loan losses  interest rate sensitivity  market risk  growth strategy  and financial and other goals 
the words believes  expects  may  will  should  projects  contemplates  anticipates  forecasts  intends  or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies if we are unable to identify attractive markets  locations or opportunities to expand in the future  changes in interest rates and their policies  risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values  the successful management of interest rate risk  maintaining cost controls and asset quality as we open or acquire new branches  maintaining capital levels adequate to support our growth  reliance on our management team  including our ability to attract and retain key personnel  competition with other banks and financial institutions  and companies outside of the banking industry  including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources  changes in general economic and business conditions in our market area  demand  development and acceptance of new products and services  problems with technology utilized by us  changing trends in customer profiles and behavior  changes in banking  other laws and regulations applicable to us  and other factors discussed in risk factors above 
because of these uncertainties  our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
financial developments prior to march  cardinal was a multi bank organization 
in  we completed the consolidation of our original four banking subsidiaries into a single bank in order to reduce costs and streamline operations and decision making 
as a result of the bank consolidation noted above  we reduced staffing levels during the fourth quarter of we reduced our number of employees from on june  to as of december  most of the staff reductions were made in the commercial lending area of the bank  which had become overstaffed in light of the shift in strategy from four banks to one 
we also made significant reductions in staff in our centralized administration areas  including accounting  deposit operations and credit administration 
we have grown our branch banking network from seven locations at the end of to eighteen locations at the end of this growth  combined with the acquisition of george mason  has resulted in the number of our employees increasing from at the beginning of to at the end of our restructuring resulted in significant savings in operating costs during however  an other than temporary write down of million on a worldcom bond recorded in the second quarter of  created a reported net loss to common shareholders of million for the year ended december  the year ended december  was our first full year of profitability 
we reported net income of million or per diluted common share in included in this net income was an income tax benefit of million attributable to the recognition of deferred tax assets since we determined that it was more likely than not that these assets would be utilized 
the pretax profit to common shareholders in was million  which was achieved through continued growth in our earning assets  as well as increases in non interest income  primarily attributable to million of realized gains on sales of investment securities available for sale 
these sales were from our mortgage backed investment securities available for sale portfolio  which had accelerated prepayment speeds as a result of the low mortgage rate environment experienced during we sold these securities with realized gains and reinvested the funds in our loan and investment securities portfolio 
we do not have plans to record such gains in the future  although we may sell portions of our available for sale investment securities portfolio as needed for liquidity or interest rate risk management purposes 
the year ended december  was our second full year of profitability 
for the year  we reported net income of million 
george mason is included in our operating results since july  and contributed approximately million to consolidated net income during the decrease in net income from the prior year is the result of the one time income tax benefit recorded in pretax income in was million compared to million in total assets increased by million in  from million at december   to billion at december  total deposits increased by million in  from million at december   to million at december  critical accounting policies general u 
s generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting  and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurements are not possible or practical 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such judgments  assumptions or estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding the accounting for business combinations  the determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for economic hedging activities  and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
accounting for business combinations we account for acquisitions of other businesses in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
this statement mandates the use of purchase accounting and  accordingly  assets and liabilities  including previously unrecorded assets and liabilities  are recorded at fair values as of the acquisition date 
we utilize a variety of valuation methods to estimate fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
these methodologies are often based upon assumptions and estimates which may change at a future date and require that the carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired be adjusted 
to reduce the possibility of future adjustments  we have utilized independent consultants to identify and value identifiable purchased intangibles 
the difference between the fair value of assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and any other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested on at least an annual basis for impairment 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of the individual borrowers 
as a part of our analysis  we use comparative peer group data  duration factors and qualitative factors such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of loans exhibiting similar risk profiles to support our estimates 
credit losses are an inherent part of our business and  although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are adequate  it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional analysis or regulatory comment 
additional provisions for such losses  if necessary  would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segment  as appropriate  and would negatively impact earnings 
for purposes of our analysis  we categorize our loans into one of five categories commercial and industrial  commercial real estate including construction  home equity lines of credit  residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
peer group annual loss factors in the absence of historical results are applied to all categories and are adjusted by the projected duration of the loan category and by the qualitative factors mentioned above 
the indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied to each of the loan categories to determine a reserve level for each of the five categories of loans 
in addition  we individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes  as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral values 
since we have limited historical data on which to base loss factors for classified loans  we apply  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  a loss factor to all special mention loans  a loss factor to all substandard loans and a loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged off 
hedging we account for our derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity sfas no 
 as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and fasb statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including loan commitments and rate lock commitments to extend credit to finance residential mortgages 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the time frame established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates move between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered derivatives in accordance with the guidance of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
accordingly  the fair value of these derivatives at the end of the reporting period has been determined through an analysis of changes in market interest rates from the interest rate lock date and loan closing date 
to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments  we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sale contracts 
these forward contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges under statement no 
the change in the fair value of loan commitments and the change in the fair value of forward sales contracts generally move in opposite directions and  accordingly  impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitments period is generally inconsequential 
although the forward loan sale contracts also serve as an economic hedge of loans held for sale  forward contracts have not been designated as accounting hedges under statement no 
and  accordingly  loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is probable of recovery 
the establishment of a valuation allowance increases the provision for income taxes 
new financial accounting standards in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provided guidance for evaluating whether an investment in debt and equity securities is other than temporarily impaired and was effective for other than temporary impairment evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after june  according to eitf  a security is impaired when its fair value is less than its carrying value  and an impairment is other than temporary if the investor does not have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery of its carrying amount 
eitf requires that once an investment is determined to be impaired  the impairment must be assessed using the ability and intent to hold criterion regardless of the severity or amount of the impairment 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment loss should be recognized in earnings 
the fasb staff subsequently issued fsp eitf  which deferred the application of measurement provisions of eitf the fasb determined that a delay in the effective date of those provisions was necessary until it can issue additional guidance on the application of eitf the disclosure provisions of eitf remain effective 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payments an amendment of fasb statements and this statement requires that companies recognize to the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 
this statement requires that stock awards be classified as either an equity award or a liability award 
equity classified awards are valued as of the grant date using either an observable market price or a valuation methodology 
liability classified awards are valued at fair value as of each reporting date 
this statement is effective for the company in the third quarter of we estimate that this new standard will result in an increase in pretax expense of approximately  in the second half of compared to the first six months of financial overview compared to at december   total assets were billion  an increase of or million  compared to million at december  total loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs  increased or million  to million at december   compared to million at december  total investment securities increased by million or  to million at december   compared to million at december  total deposits increased or million  to million at december   compared to million at december  other borrowed funds  which primarily include repurchase agreements  fhlb advances and our payable to cardinal statutory trust i  increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  during  we introduced repurchase agreements to our customers  which totaled million at december  and million at december  advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta were million at december   and million at december  shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  the increase in shareholders equity was primarily attributable to million of additional equity raised as a result of the underwriters exercising in january their over allotment option in connection with our stock offering and net income of million

the level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates 
during and continuing in  we experienced a weakened economy that had entered into a recessionary phase early in during  the federal reserve lowered rates eleven times in order to generate economic growth 
during the fourth quarter of  in response to this weakening economy and the lack of any inflationary pressures  the federal reserve lowered rates an additional basis points 
during the second quarter of  the federal reserve again decreased interest rates another basis points 
at the end of  the prime lending rate was at  its lowest level in over forty years 
during and into as economic activity has increased  the federal reserve raised the key federal funds rate six times to 
the prime lending rate increased from at the end of to at the end of see interest rate sensitivity for further information 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in net interest income is a result of increases in average volume of investment securities  loans held for sale and loans receivable  net of the impact of decreased yields during  compared with the same period of these net increases were funded through the increases in total deposits and other borrowed funds 
our net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively  as a result of earning asset yields declining more quickly than the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to in from in and our cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to in from in the yield on other borrowed funds  which generally are shorter term fundings and which we utilized to a greater extent in than as a result of the george mason acquisition  increased basis points to for compared to for total earning assets increased by to billion at december   compared to million at december  this resulted primarily from a million increase in loans held for sale as a result of our george mason acquisition and a million increase in loans receivable 
these increases were funded by deposit growth of million  or  and other borrowed funds and warehouse financing growth of million over december  balances 
in addition  other borrowed funds increased by million during to million at december   compared to million at december  average loans receivable increased million to million during from million in average balances of nonperforming assets  which consist of non accrual loans  are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in and additional interest income of approximately  for and  for would have been realized had all nonperforming assets performed as originally expected 
nonperforming assets exclude loans that are both past due days or more and still accruing interest due to an assessment of collectibility 
average total deposits increased million to million in from million in the largest increase in average deposit balances was experienced in certificates of deposit  an increase of million compared to  a result of our branch expansion and increased advertising of our rates on certificates of deposit 
in addition  to assist in the funding of george mason s loans held for sale  we began using the brokered certificates of deposit market during at december   we had million of brokered certificates of deposit 
our utilization of the brokered certificates of deposit market averaged million in net interest income was million for the year ended december   up million or from the increase was primarily due to the increase in loans and investment securities available for sale during  funded through the increase in total deposits and shareholders equity 
our net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin was a result of the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities offset slightly by the decrease in the yield on average earning assets 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to in from in and our cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to in from in the decrease in our cost of interest bearing deposits is primarily the result of our decreasing the rate on our president s club relationship product to  down from at december  in addition  the yield on other borrowed funds decreased basis points to at december  compared to december  total earning assets increased by to million at december   compared to million at december  this increase consisted mainly of an million  or increase in loans receivable  net of fees and a million  or increase in total investment securities 
these increases were funded by deposit growth of million  or  and other borrowed funds growth of million over december  balances 
in addition  proceeds from our secondary common stock offering of million funded our earning asset growth as of december  average total loans increased million to million during from million in average balances of non performing assets  which consist of non accrual loans  are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in and additional interest income of approximately  for and  for would have been realized had all non performing assets performed as originally expected

interest income on non accruing loans was not material for years presented 
we do not have investments that have tax benefit attributes  therefore  there are no tax equivalent adjustments to our net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk 
our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk 
management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain 
we manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee alco 
alco is responsible for managing the interest rate risk for the company in conjunction with liquidity and capital management 
in managing interest rate sensitivity  the alco committee until the third quarter of primarily used gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to determine the volume of interest sensitive assets less interest sensitive liabilities in various time intervals 
the difference is the interest sensitivity gap which indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
at december   we were liability sensitive within a one year time horizon  which means that rising rates had an adverse impact on net interest income 
a negative gap  or liability sensitive position exists when we have more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time frame than interest sensitive assets 
based on gap analysis  we could then simulate how changes in interest rates would impact net interest income 
we maintained guidelines on both the level of acceptable gaps as well as guidelines for negative variances of net interest income given certain interest rate changes 
beginning with the interest rate sensitivity analysis for the third quarter of  we hired an independent consulting firm to model the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
instead of gap analysis  we began using a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity 
many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as now  money market and savings accounts 
based on inputs that include the current balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged 
this is considered the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be given changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations performed include a ramped rate change of down basis points and up basis points over a two year time period 
in the ramped rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were asset sensitive 
asset sensitive means that we had more assets maturing and repricing than liabilities 
we have a significant portion of our assets as floating rate assets and we have taken a significant amount of term funding through fixed rate  fixed term  certificates of deposit 
in a rising rate environment  net interest income should grow for an asset sensitive bank 
in the up basis point scenario for one year  net interest income improves by not more than compared to the base case and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
being asset sensitive  net interest income declines compared to the base case in the down basis point scenario 
at december   net interest income has a negative variance to the base case of less than for the one year period and a negative variance of less than over the cumulative two year period 
provision expense and allowance for loan losses our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of the individual borrower 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million compared to million at december  our allowance for loan loss ratio at december  was compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is primarily reflective of the shift in the loan mix in our portfolio and a slight improvement in overall loan quality 
our growth in the loan portfolio was mostly comprised of increases in our residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loan portfolios  which require lower reserve coverage than other portions of the loan portfolio 
we continued to experience strong loan quality with annualized net charged off loans equal to to average loans receivable for the year ended december   and non performing loans equal to of total loans as of december  provision for loan losses was  for the growth in loans during was comprised primarily of increases in our residential and home equity loan portfolios  which require lower reserve amounts than the remainder of the loan portfolio

non interest income non interest income includes service charges on deposits and loans  gains on the sale of loans held for sale  investment fee income  management fee income and gains on sales of investment securities available for sale  and continues to be an important factor in our operating results 
non interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of increased gains on the sale of loans held for sale of million as a result of our acquisition of george mason in july also contributing to the increase in non interest income  and also as a direct result of the george mason acquisition  management fee income rose by million from to offsetting these increases was a million decrease in gains on sales of investment securities available for sale from to management fees represent the income earned for services provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders 
the gains on the sale of investment securities available for sale were recorded on sales of mortgage backed securities with accelerated prepayment speeds  a result of the lower interest rate environment experienced during service charges on deposit accounts increased and investment fees decreased slightly from levels 
deposit service charges increased primarily as a result of an increased number of transaction accounts and investment fees decreased primarily as a result of reduced finders fees earned by cardinal wealth services 
loan service charges increased by  from to non interest income increased by  from to as previously noted  due to the interest rate condition  we recorded gains on investment securities available for sale during in  these gains were  greater than in in addition  gains on the sale of loans held for sale increased by  from to these gains  along with a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts  were partially offset by a  reduction in investment fee income

expenses related to the branch expansion are represented in the increases in our salaries and benefits expense and occupancy expense 
expenses have also increased in professional fees  marketing and advertising  and loan expenses to support our branch openings and strong asset growth over the past year

deposits and other borrowed funds total deposits were million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to december  this growth is primarily attributable to the opening of seven branch offices during in addition  to assist in the funding of george mason s loans held for sale  we began using the brokered certificates of deposit market during at december   we had million of brokered certificates of deposit at an average rate of

our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence 
regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution 
the guidelines define capital as both tier primarily common shareholders equity  defined to include certain debt obligations and tier to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and of unrealized gains in equity securities

at december   shareholders equity was million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
this increase in shareholders equity was primarily driven by our completion of a secondary common stock offering that raised million of equity capital in december in addition  we recorded net income to common shareholders of million for the year ended december  these increases were offset by an unfavorable mark to market adjustment of million in our investment securities available for sale portfolio

we must be able to meet these needs with cash on hand by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non cash items to cash 
the objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient liquid resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position 
in addition  we have demonstrated our ability to attract retail deposits because of our convenient branch locations  personal service and pricing 
in addition to retail deposits  we have access to the different wholesale funding markets 
these markets include the brokered cd market  the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market 
in addition  we maintain secured lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding 
cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers 
we have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management 
for our liquidity management program  we first determine our current liquidity position 
liquidity is then forecasted based on forecasted changes in the balance sheet 
the bank expects to maintain a certain liquidity cushion throughout the forecast period 
in addition to the forecast  we also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios 
guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established 
in addition  one stress test combines all other stress tests to see how liquidity would react to several negative scenarios occurring at the same time 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs 
in september  george mason and the cardinal bank entered into a one year million floating rate revolving credit and security agreement with a third party 
the purpose of this credit facility is to fund residential mortgage loans at george mason prior to their sale into the secondary market 
the credit facility requires  among other things  that george mason and the bank have positive quarterly net income and maintain specified minimum tangible and regulatory net worth levels 
the company has guaranteed repayment of this debt 
the interest rate on this credit facility is libor plus between and 
at december   of this line was utilized 
in addition to this facility  this same lender has also provided a million facility that is utilized by george mason to warehouse residential mortgage loans held for sale to this lender 
the terms of this facility are substantially the same as the above referenced revolving credit and security agreement and the cost of this facility is netted against interest earned on the loans pending settlement with the lender 
at december   of this line was utilized 
george mason also had a million line of credit with an unaffiliated party  which it uses to warehouse loans pending sale 
this line matured on march  and had an interest rate of libor plus

we are committed to maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
contractual obligations we have entered into a number of long term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities 
these contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us 
the required payments under such obligations were as follows table contractual obligations at december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years certificates of deposit of  or more brokered certificates of deposits advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta trust preferred securities operating lease obligations total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and credit risk we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we hold certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary
