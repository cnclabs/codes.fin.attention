estimates are used for such items as collectability of trade accounts receivable  inventory valuation  depreciable lives  self insurance programs  warranty costs and income taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  and historical collection and allowances amounts

the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience and actual returns and allowances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
raw steel  lumber and wood frame parts are valued on the last in  first out lifo method 
other inventories are valued on the first in  first out fifo method 
changes in the market conditions could require a write down of inventory 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets and estimated depreciable or amortizable lives for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows and is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that asset carrying values may not be recoverable or that the estimated depreciable or amortizable lives may have changed 
these evaluations could result in a change in estimated useful lives in future periods

the actual claims experience could differ from the estimates made by the company 
warranty the company estimates the amount of warranty claims on sold product that may be incurred based on current and historical data 
the actual warranty expense could differ from the estimates made by the company based on product performance 
income taxes deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition is upon delivery of product to our customer 
our ordering process creates persuasive evidence of the sale arrangement and the sales amount is determined

 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the fsp to provide guidance on the application of sfas no 
to the provision within the american jobs creation act of the act that provides tax relief to us domestic manufacturers 
the fsp states that the manufacturers deduction provided for under the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate reduction 
a special deduction is accounted for by recording the benefit of the deduction in the year in which it can be taken in the company s tax return  and by not adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of the act s enactment which would have been done if the deduction on qualified production activities were treated as a change in enacted tax rates

for fiscal year repayment of debt and the payment of dividends were the primary financing activities utilizing cash 
in fiscal years and  the payment of dividends was the primary financing activity utilizing cash 
the company has adequate cash  cash equivalents  short term investment and credit arrangements to meet its operating and capital requirements 
in the opinion of management  the company s liquidity and credit resources provide it with the ability to react to opportunities as they arise  the ability to pay quarterly dividends to its shareholders  and ensures that productive capital assets that enhance safety and improve operations are purchased as needed 
the company s contractual obligations as of june  are as follows in thousands for the years ending june  total debt obligations    interest  operating lease obligations   total contractual obligations    at june  the company had no capital lease obligations  and no purchase obligations for raw materials or finished goods extending more than six months

at june   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the credit agreement 
outlook for the fiscal year ended june   residential net sales have been weaker than the prior year and we expect that this softness will continue through the first half of fiscal year due to rising interest rates and higher energy costs that may dampen consumer confidence 
net sales of vehicle seating have fallen off as several manufacturers of recreational vehicles adjust inventory levels of finished units due to weakness in demand for recreational vehicles 
we expect that net sales will remain relatively stable during the first quarter of fiscal we expect lower net sales in our second fiscal quarter due to lower demand for recreational vehicles 
additionally  the volatility and high cost of fuel may temper the favorable longer term demographics that exist in the recreational vehicle industry 
our commercial marketing channels provide an opportunity to expand distribution and increase net sales in the first half of fiscal commercial office furniture net sales will benefit from a continued general increase in demand for these products 
hospitality occupancy rates have improved with an increase in business and recreational travel 
this improvement has led to increased construction and renovation activity that has led to increased demand for the hospitality products we offer 
margin pressures continued through all of fiscal year and we expect pressures on margins to continue through the first half of fiscal  with the cost of fuel being a key element 
the rise in fuel cost continues to negatively impact the cost of bringing raw materials into our factories  as well as the cost of delivering finished products to our customers 
petroleum prices are setting record prices weekly  if not daily  and we anticipate that prices will remain volatile and at record or near record levels for at least the first half of fiscal year the result will be continuing increasing costs and we believe a factor keeping consumer confidence at relative low levels  negatively affecting demand for residential and vehicle seating products 
the cost of steel appears to have steadied during the second half of the fiscal year just ended  albeit at relatively high historical prices 
the cost of chemicals required in manufacturing poly foam used in our seating products increased throughout fiscal at this time there are no announced price increases for poly foam 
the furniture industry is in an unprecedented period of change 
there are increases in the cost of raw materials and fuel accompanied by an increased flow of competing product from all over the world that have added to pricing pressures 
the distribution channels are changing and increasingly include such non traditional customers such as mass merchandisers  wholesale clubs and specialty retail chains in addition to e commerce opportunities 
flexsteel continues to take actions to address the above concerns including new product introductions  refining existing product offerings  adjusting selling and delivery prices  adjusting production levels and implementing cost control measures for inventory and capital expenditures 
these actions occur regularly regardless of operating performance  but will continue to receive additional attention under current business conditions 
flexsteel is also in a unique position to take advantage of the rapid change that is affecting most of the markets we serve 
we have had tremendous success in the introduction of our complete new line of wrangler home collection 
we continue to develop products for the marine industry to augment our vehicle seating products 
our commercial office product lineup is strong and expanded to continue to take full advantage as demand for this product increases 
our hospitality team is poised to deliver the needed products as this market expansion continues 
we continue to believe that our strategy of providing furniture from a wide selection of domestically manufactured and imported products is sound business practice 
this blended strategy gives flexsteel the opportunity to successfully participate in all the important avenues of furniture distribution in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located and disruptions associated with shipping distances 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
foreign currency risk during fiscal  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies  nor did it have any active subsidiaries located in foreign countries 
as such  the company is not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately  assuming no change in the volume or composition of debt 
the company has effectively fixed the interest rates at on approximately million of its long term debt through the use of interest rate swaps  and the above estimated earnings reduction takes these swaps into account 
as of june   the fair value of these swaps is an asset of approximately  and is included in other assets 
tariffs the company has exposure to actions by governments  including tariffs 
tariffs are a possibility on any imported or exported products
