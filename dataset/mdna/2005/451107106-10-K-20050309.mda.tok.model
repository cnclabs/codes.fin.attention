introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the general financial condition and results of operations for idacorp  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  idacorp and idaho power company and its subsidiary collectively  ipc are discussed 
idacorp is a holding company formed in whose principal operating subsidiary is ipc 
idacorp is exempt from registration as a public utility holding company pursuant to section a of the public utility holding company act of act 
in addition  pursuant to rule of the general rules and regulations under the act  idacorp is exempt from all the provisions of the act and rules thereunder  except for section a of the act  which requires idacorp to seek prior securities and exchange commission approval to acquire securities of another public utility company 
ipc is an electric utility with a service territory covering approximately  square miles  primarily in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
the measurement of ipc s service area increased by approximately  square miles over due to the conversion from a manual mapping system to global information system technology 
ipc is the parent of idaho energy resources co  a joint venturer in bridger coal company  which supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant owned in part by ipc 
idacorp s other operating subsidiaries include idacorp financial services  inc ifs holder of affordable housing and other real estate investments  idatech developer of integrated fuel cell systems  idacomm provider of telecommunications services and commercial and residential internet services  and ida west energy ida west operator of independent power projects 
idacorp energy ie  a marketer of electricity and natural gas  wound down its operations during also in  ida west discontinued its project development operations and is managing its independent power projects with a reduced workforce 
see further discussions in results of operations energy marketing and results of operations ida west later in the md a 
in  idacorp transferred its ownership of rmc holdings  inc and its subsidiary velocitus to idacomm 
in january  rmc holdings  inc and velocitus were merged into idacomm 
while reading the md a  please refer to the consolidated financial statements of idacorp and ipc  which present the financial position at december  and  and the results of operations and cash flows for each company for the years ended december   and forward looking information in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of reform act  idacorp and ipc are hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements as such term is defined in the reform act made by or on behalf of idacorp or ipc in this annual report on form k  any quarterly report on form q  any current report on form k  in presentations  in response to questions or otherwise

any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
risk factors the following are factors that could have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of idacorp  inc and idaho power company and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements reduced hydroelectric generation can reduce revenues and increase costs 
idaho power company has a predominately hydroelectric generating base 
because of idaho power company s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation  the weather can significantly affect its operations 
idaho power company is experiencing its sixth consecutive year of below normal water conditions in when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power company must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power 
through its power cost adjustment in idaho  idaho power company can expect to recover approximately percent of the increase in its idaho jurisdictional net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  above the level included in its base rates 
the power cost adjustment recovery includes both a forecast and deferrals that are subject to the regulatory process 
the non idaho net power supply costs are subject to periodic recovery from its oregon and federal energy regulatory commission jurisdictional customers 
continuing declines in stream flows and over appropriation of water in idaho will reduce hydroelectric generation and revenues and increase costs 
the combination of declining snake river base flows  over appropriation of water and continuing drought conditions have led to disputes among certain surface water and ground water irrigators  and the state of idaho 
recharging the eastern snake river aquifer  which contributes to snake river flows  by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the dispute 
idaho power company believes aquifer recharge would further reduce snake river base flows available for hydroelectric generation  reduce idaho power company revenues and increase costs 
changes in temperature can reduce power sales and revenues 
warmer than normal winters or cooler than normal summers will reduce retail revenues from power sales 
the idaho public utilities commission s grant of less rate relief than requested will reduce idaho power company s projected earnings and cash flows 
because idaho power company did not receive the full amount of rate relief requested  its projected earnings and cash flows have been reduced and idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings have been downgraded 
if the idaho public utilities commission were to grant less rate relief than idaho power company requests in the future  it could have a negative effect on earnings and cash flow and result in future downgrades of idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings 
a downgrade in idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings could negatively affect the companies ability to access capital 
on november   standard poor s ratings services  on december   moody s investors service  and on january   fitch  inc each downgraded idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings 
these downgrades and any future downgrades of idacorp  inc s or idaho power company s credit ratings could limit the companies ability to access the capital markets  including the commercial paper markets 
in addition  idacorp  inc and idaho power company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate on existing variable rate debt and in future financings 
conditions that may be imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for several of its hydroelectric projects 
conditions with respect to environmental  operating and other matters that the federal energy regulatory commission may impose in connection with the renewal of idaho power company s licenses could have a negative effect on idaho power company s operations  require large capital expenditures and reduce earnings and cash flows 
the cost of complying with environmental regulations can harm cash flows and earnings 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources and health and safety 
compliance with these environmental statutes  rules and regulations involves significant capital  operating and other costs  and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of changes in legislation and enforcement policies 
for instance  considerable attention has been focused on carbon dioxide emissions from coal fired generating plants and their potential role in contributing to global warming and mercury emissions from coal fired plants 
the adoption of new laws and regulations to implement carbon dioxide  mercury or other emission controls could adversely affect operations and increase the cost of operating coal fired generating plants 
terrorist threats and activities could result in reduced revenues and increased costs 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities 
potential targets include generation and transmission facilities 
the effects of terrorist threats and activities could prevent idaho power company from purchasing  generating or transmitting power and result in reduced revenues and increased costs 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy and idaho power company are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings  settlements  investigations and claims  including those that have arisen out of the western energy situation 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy and idaho power company are involved in a number of proceedings including a complaint filed against sellers of power in california  based on california s unfair competition law  a cross action wholesale electric antitrust case against various sellers and generators of power in california and the california refund proceeding at the federal energy regulatory commission 
other cases that are the direct or indirect result of the western energy situation include a refund proceeding affecting sellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the pacific northwest  in which the federal energy regulatory commission directed that no refunds be paid  but which is now pending on appeal before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  efforts by certain parties to reform or terminate contracts for the purchase of power from idacorp energy or claiming violations of state and federal antitrust acts and dysfunctional energy markets as the result of market manipulation  show cause proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission  which have been settled but are the subject of motions for rehearing or have been appealed and the reversal by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit of federal energy regulatory commission rulings that market based sellers transactional reports satisfy the federal energy regulatory commission s filed rate doctrine requirements as a means of expanding refunds from all sellers of wholesale power  which rulings remain pending before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on rehearing 
to the extent the companies are required to make payments  earnings will be negatively affected 
it is possible that additional proceedings related to the western energy situation may be filed in the future against idacorp  inc  idacorp energy or idaho power company 
pending shareholder litigation could be costly  time consuming and  if adversely decided  result in substantial liabilities 
two securities shareholder lawsuits consolidated by order dated august  have been filed against idacorp  inc and certain of its officers and directors 
securities litigation can be costly  time consuming and disruptive to normal business operations 
certain costs below a self insured retention are not covered by insurance policies 
while idacorp  inc cannot predict the outcome of these matters and these matters will take time to resolve  damages arising from these lawsuits if resolved against idacorp  inc or in connection with any settlement  absent insurance coverage or damages in excess of insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of idacorp  inc litigation relating to stray voltage  if adversely decided  could result in liabilities  reducing earnings  and encourage the commencement of additional lawsuits 
in three instances  dairy farmers have brought actions against idaho power company claiming loss of milk production and other damages to livestock due to stray voltage from idaho power company s electrical system 
in the first proceeding  the jury ruled in idaho power company s favor 
in the second proceeding  a jury verdict was entered in favor of the plaintiffs 
a third is in the discovery stage 
adverse court rulings in such proceedings could increase the number of future claims 
the costs of defending these lawsuits could be significant  and certain costs  such as those below a deductible amount  are not covered by insurance policies 
increased capital expenditures can significantly affect liquidity 
increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission  distribution and generating systems 
because idaho power company did not receive the full amount of rate relief requested  idaho power company will have to rely more on external financing for its planned utility construction expenditures in the through period  these large planned expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of idaho power company and idacorp  inc additionally  a significant portion of idaho power company s facilities were constructed many years ago 
aging equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures 
failure of equipment or facilities used in idaho power company s systems could potentially increase repair and maintenance expenses  purchased power expenses and capital expenditures 
if idacorp  inc and idaho power company are unable to complete future assessments as to the adequacy of their internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or if the companies complete the future assessments and identify and report material weaknesses  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of the companies financial statements  which could decrease the value of idacorp  inc s common stock 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission has adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
this report is required to contain management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the most recent fiscal year 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a public company s financial statements must also attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
effective internal controls are necessary for the companies to provide reliable financial reports and to prevent and detect fraud 
if the companies should fail to have an effectively designed and operating system of internal control over financial reporting  this could result in decreased confidence in the reliability of the companies financial statements  which could cause the market price of idacorp  inc s common stock to decline 
business strategy  overview of and outlook for this section presents an overview of what management believes are the most critical issues that idacorp and ipc are facing and the significant items that affected idacorp s and ipc s operating results 
these items will be discussed in more detail within various sections of the md a 
business strategy idacorp continues to focus on a strategy called electricity plus  a back to basics strategy that emphasizes ipc as idacorp s core business 
ipc continues to experience strong customer growth in its service area  and this corporate strategy recognizes that ipc must make substantial investments in infrastructure to ensure adequate supply and reliable service 
the plus recognizes that through modest investments in idatech and idacomm  idacorp can preserve the potential for additional growth in shareowner value 
ifs  with its affordable housing and historic rehabilitation portfolio  remains a key component of the revised corporate strategy 
the electricity plus strategy includes seeking timely rate relief in both the idaho and oregon jurisdictions 
ipc plans to file in idaho and oregon for either asset specific or general rate relief regularly in upcoming years 
the first of these filings was on march  for the bennett mountain power plant 
ipc also plans to file an idaho general rate case in the fall of water conditions and weather as ipc s service territory enters the sixth consecutive year of below normal water conditions  ipc expects to rely more on higher cost thermal generation and wholesale power purchases 
historically  hydroelectric generation has provided approximately percent of ipc s total system generation 
in  ipc produced percent of its power at its hydroelectric facilities 
ipc has already incurred higher purchased power expenses in january  compared to  and expects power supply costs to remain high as long as below normal water conditions persist 
generation at ipc s hydroelectric facilities is currently expected to be million mwh in compared to normal generation of million mwh 
also  temperatures through february  as measured by heating degree days in boise  idaho  were approximately seven percent warmer than normal and eleven percent warmer than if winter temperatures remain at or above last year s levels  idacorp s and ipc s earnings could be negatively impacted by reduced electric usage 
the continuing below normal water conditions have exacerbated a developing water shortage in idaho 
the state has been observing declining snake river base flows since the early s 
this water shortage has led to conflicts between ground water and surface water irrigators 
at times during the year  flows into the snake river are dependent upon spring flows fed by the eastern snake plain aquifer 
one proposed solution is aquifer recharge diverting surface water to porous surface locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer 
ipc believes aquifer recharge is inconsistent with state law and would adversely impact generation at its hydroelectric plants 
efforts have been underway since to find a solution to this conflict 
a march interim agreement stayed all administrative and legal proceedings to give the parties one year to develop a solution 
in january  surface irrigators not a party to the interim agreement submitted a delivery call letter and filed a petition with the idaho department of water resources requesting delivery of their senior natural flow and storage rights and for the designation of the eastern snake plain aquifer as a ground water management area 
ipc has sought intervention in these matters  which has been opposed by the idaho ground water appropriators  inc capital requirements and cash flows idacorp expects internal cash generation after dividends will provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through the contribution for internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs 
current forecasts indicate total utility construction expenditures to be million  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afdc  over the next three years 
this amount reflects the need for additional resources in order for ipc to supply power to a growing number of customers while considering the maintenance of corporate credit ratings 
idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital requirements with internally generated funds and with increased reliance on externally financed capital 
in december  idacorp issued approximately million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
idacorp used million of these proceeds to reduce short term borrowings and contributed million to ipc 
ipc used a portion of the proceeds to pay down short term borrowings 
financial results idacorp s basic and diluted earnings per share eps for the year of was a per share increase over s results of per share 
the increase is primarily due to improved results at ipc  a gain on the sale of an investment at ifs and the negative impacts of exiting energy trading at ie and asset impairments at ida west in ipc s earnings of per share for are a per share increase over last year 
this increase was driven by the settlement of the irrigation lost revenue case allowing ipc to recover approximately million that was written off in plus million in related interest 
the million is included in other operating revenue and the interest is included in other income 
ipc s other operating revenue also increased million primarily as a result of settlement no 
with the ipuc discussed later  regarding the calculation of ipc s income taxes 
additionally  the portion of net power supply costs absorbed by ipc and not recovered under the idaho power cost adjustment pca and oregon excess power cost mechanisms decreased by million 
ipc s income tax expense decreased million largely due to the reversal of a million regulatory liability that was established in and reversed as part of settlement no 
with the ipuc discussed later 
these increases to net income were partially offset by a million rise in other operations and maintenance expense mainly due to higher payroll expenses associated with an employee incentive program and a write off of approximately million of disallowed costs related to the idaho general rate case 
ifs contributed per share  principally from the generation of federal income tax credits and tax depreciation benefits 
these results also include a million gain on the sale of ifs s investment in the el cortez hotel in san diego  california 
ida west s earnings of per share are a per share increase over last year s loss of per share 
during  ida west recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt by purchasing million of debt issued by marysville hydro partners  a percent owned  consolidated joint venture 
ida west s gain  net of minority interest  was approximately million 
in  ida west wrote down its remaining investment in the garnet project and two joint ventures and recorded a reserve on a note receivable 
ie earned per share for primarily from gains on settlements of legal disputes  which are included as offsets to energy marketing operating expenses 
in  ie posted a net loss of per share due to losses on legal settlements and continued wind down costs  partially offset by a gain on the sale of its forward book of electricity trading contracts 
regulatory matters irrigation lost revenues on december   the ipuc issued order no 
allowing ipc to recover million in revenues and million of interest resulting from ipc s irrigation load reduction program 
the recovery will be included as part of ipc s annual pca beginning june  general rate case ipc filed its idaho general rate case with the ipuc on october  the ipuc approved an increase of million in ipc s electric rates  an average of percent  in an order issued on may  the rate increase became effective on june  the ipuc also approved a return on equity of percent 
the ipuc disallowed several costs in the order  including million annually related to the determination of ipc s income tax expense  million of incentive payments capitalized in prior years and million of capitalized pension expense 
on june   ipc filed with the ipuc a petition for reconsideration of these and other items 
on july   the ipuc granted this petition in part  agreeing to reconsider the issue relating to the determination of ipc s income tax expense and  in light of the ipuc staff s computational errors  ordering rates increased by approximately million on or before august  ipc recorded an impairment of assets in the second quarter of related to the disallowed incentive payments and the disallowed capitalized pension expenses 
the final result of ipc s idaho general rate case was a million increase to the base idaho jurisdictional revenue requirement  comprised of million in the initial order  million related to computational errors and million in the order approving settlement no 
discussed below 
ipc filed an oregon general rate case with the opuc on september  requesting an increase of million annually 
settlement agreements on september   the ipuc issued separate orders approving two settlement agreements entered into on august  between ipc and the ipuc staff 
settlement no 
relates to the calculation of ipc s taxes for purposes of test year income tax expense 
as a result of settlement no 
 ipc will compute and record over the month period june  through may  a regulatory asset of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount was recognized as other operating revenue as of december  settlement no 
resolved outstanding issues related to an unplanned outage at one of the two units of the north valmy steam electric generating plant valmy in the summer of  a matter relating to the expense adjustment rate for growth component of the pca and regulatory accounting issues related to a tax accounting method change in as a result of settlement no 
 ipc established a regulatory liability of million with a charge to pca expense 
also  ipc reversed a million regulatory tax liability by reducing income tax expense 
relicensing for several years  ipc has been actively pursuing the relicensing of some of its hydroelectric projects 
the following is a summary of the status of relicensing activity middle snake river projects on august   ipc received the ferc license orders for each of its five middle snake river projects 
ipc is now in the process of developing protection  mitigation and enhancement pm e plans to ensure compliance with the various license articles 
two environmental organizations have filed petitions for rehearing of the orders issuing the licenses for the middle snake river projects 
the ferc has yet to issue orders on these petitions 
malad project ipc filed a new license application for the malad project in july and the license expired on august  the ferc has issued a final environmental assessment under the national environmental policy act of nepa and ipc expects a new license to be issued in hells canyon complex this represents ipc s most significant relicensing effort 
ipc filed its license application in july and the current license will expire in july ipc s current application  including water quality measures as part of the state s process under section of the clean water act  identifies proposed pm e measures totaling approximately million 
ipc s preliminary estimate of the cost of all the proposed pm e measures submitted by other parties participating in the hells canyon relicensing process is approximately billion over up to a year period 
ipc is engaged in discussions with the ferc and relevant federal and state agencies on the effects  if any  of the relicensing of the hells canyon complex on species listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act esa 
these discussions are generally referred to as the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process 
on january   ipc filed an agreement on interim operations with the ferc 
the interim agreement is intended to address issues relating to operations of the hells canyon complex and esa listed species in advance of the issuance of a new license while the parties continue discussions in an effort to negotiate a comprehensive relicensing settlement agreement 
pursuant to the requirements of nepa  the ferc is independently evaluating the environmental effects of relicensing the hells canyon complex 
ipc and a number of participants in the settlement discussions have requested that the ferc defer its nepa schedule to enable the parties to pursue a comprehensive relicensing settlement in the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process discussions 
the ferc granted ipc s request for deferral 
the relicensing process permits intervenors to submit additional study requests to the ferc 
the ferc received a total of additional study requests and the ferc has issued to ipc a total of additional information requests 
ipc and those participating in the relicensing process have objected to the ferc s decision and the ferc has made a number of rulings on the objections 
meanwhile  ipc is proceeding with the studies and analysis relevant to the additional information requests 
legal issues idacorp  ipc and ie have been named as defendants in a number of legal cases 
major developments include on september   the idaho supreme court dismissed ipc s appeal of a verdict awarding vierstra dairy approximately million 
the dismissal was incident to a settlement of the matter among ipc  ipc s insurance carrier and the plaintiffs 
the settlement  less a deductible  was covered by insurance and did not have a material effect on ipc  on may   herculano and frances alves brought an action against ipc seeking unspecified monetary damages alleging that ipc allowed electrical current to flow in the earth injuring their right to use and enjoy their property and adversely affecting their dairy herd  on october   the ninth circuit court of appeals unanimously affirmed a district court s dismissal of the california attorney general s action against ipc and twelve other defendants claiming violations of the federal power act  three similar cases in us district court arising out of the western energy situation alleging anti trust violations and market manipulation against idacorp  ipc and ie were dismissed 
the action by the port of seattle against idacorp and ipc was dismissed on may  and is on appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
the actions by the city of tacoma and wah chang against idacorp  ipc and ie were both dismissed on february  on august   the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed a us district court dismissal of a complaint filed by the public utility district no 
of grays harbor county  washington against idacorp and ie claiming an electric purchase contract was void and unenforceable and seeking restitution but permitted grays harbor leave to amend its complaint to seek declaratory relief only as to contract formation  two shareholder lawsuits against idacorp and certain of its directors and officers alleging materially false and misleading statements or omissions about idacorp s financial outlook and seeking unspecified monetary damages were consolidated and the defendants filed a consolidated motion to dismiss on february   which is now pending  powerex corp 
filed suit against idacorp and ie alleging breach of an oral and written contract and seeking unspecified general damages  in the market manipulation proceeding  on january   the ferc approved the ferc staff s motion to dismiss the partnership proceeding against ipc and no rehearing was sought 
on march   the ferc approved ipc s settlement in the gaming proceeding and eight parties sought rehearing  and on may   the ferc office of market oversight and investigations issued a letter advising ipc that it was terminating its investigation of ipc in its bidding investigation 
critical accounting policies idacorp s and ipc s discussion and analysis of their financial condition and results of operations are based upon their consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires idacorp and ipc to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  idacorp and ipc evaluate these estimates  including those related to rate regulation  benefit costs  contingencies  litigation  impairment of assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and bad debt 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
idacorp and ipc  based on their ongoing reviews  will make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
idacorp and ipc believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for rate regulation a regulated company must satisfy the following conditions in order to apply the accounting policies and practices of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
sfas requires companies that meet the above conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities and amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
ipc follows sfas  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating ipc 
the primary effect of this policy is that ipc has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  while ipc expects to fully recover these regulatory assets and return these regulatory liabilities  such recovery is subject to final review by the regulatory entities 
if ipc should determine in the future that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas  it would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
ipc intends to seek recovery of all of its prudent costs  including stranded costs  in the event of deregulation 
however  due to the current lack of definitive legislation  ipc cannot predict whether recovery would be successful 
if ipc has to write off a material amount of the regulatory assets  it will have a material adverse effect on ipc s results of operations and financial position 
pension expense ipc maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most employees and an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors 
idacorp s and ipc s recorded pension expense for these plans is dependent on a number of factors  including the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets and several actuarial assumptions used in the valuations upon which pension expense is based 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management reviews these assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates and other factors used to develop these assumptions are extremely uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
based on recent market trends  the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be reduced to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical real returns after inflation for each asset class  based on a recognized index established for the asset class being measured s p index for large cap core stocks  russell growth for large cap growth stocks  etc historical real returns are then adjusted to include an inflation premium based on the current inflation environment 
currently a three percent inflation assumption is used in the asset modeling process 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets will be percent in  the same as in pension expense for these plans totaled million  million and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor costs 
for  pension expense is expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the reduction of the discount rate noted above and returns on plan assets in that exceeded actuarial estimates 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of increase effect of decrease no cash contributions were made to the qualified plan in through  and none are expected in under the non qualified plan  ipc makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
payments averaged approximately million per year in through  and a similar amount is anticipated in please refer to note of idacorp s consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information about pension expense  including results of the actuarial valuations  actuarial assumptions used to measure pension expense and information about plan assets 
contingent liabilities there are a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory  legal and tax matters 
contingent liabilities are provided for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies not meeting both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
the companies have made estimates of the ultimate resolution of all such matters  based on the facts and circumstances  opinions of legal counsel and other factors 
if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the current financial statements 
asset impairment idacorp has several assets that are tested for impairment in accordance with various accounting pronouncements 
those assets that were tested in include the following goodwill idacorp has million of goodwill related to its investments in idacomm and idatech 
idacorp conducts its impairment tests under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  and more frequently when events occur or circumstances change that more likely than not would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
sfas requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be compared with its carrying value to determine the amount of the impairment 
idacorp s recorded goodwill amounts were tested for impairment as required  and no impairment was noted 
the fair value calculations used for these tests require idacorp to make assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
assumptions related to future market demand  market prices and product costs could vary from actual results  and the impact of such variations could be material 
factors that could affect the assumptions include changes in economic conditions  success in developing marketable products and services and competitive conditions in the telecommunications and fuel cell industries 
long lived assets long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
southwest intertie project ipc began developing the southwest intertie project swip in ipc s investment consists predominantly of rights of way over public lands in idaho and nevada 
the swip rights of way extend from midpoint substation in south central idaho through eastern nevada to the crystal switchyard north of las vegas  nevada 
ipc does not currently anticipate constructing this transmission line itself and is in discussions regarding the sale of the rights of way 
the bureau of land management recently granted a five year extension to begin construction of a proposed kv transmission line within the rights of way before december based on these discussions and management expectations regarding the ultimate development of swip  no impairment has been identified 
these expectations are based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
investments ifs has affordable housing and other investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for two investments now consolidated under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb  these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded under apb is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
prior to the decision to discontinue ida west s project development activities  ida west had the intent and ability to hold the investments for a period sufficient to recover the recorded value 
based upon the change in management s intent  these investments were tested for impairment  and two of the investments were determined to be impaired  resulting in a write down of million in the impairment amounts are based on the estimated fair value of the investments 
impairment tests on these investments were performed in and no impairment was noted 
these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future stream flows  revenues  cash flows and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and ipc s earnings over the last three years 
in this analysis  the results of are compared to and the results of are compared to the analysis is organized by idacorp s reportable segments  which are utility operations and ifs 
the following table presents eps for both reportable segments as well as for the holding company and its other subsidiaries combined eps of common stock utility operations ifs other total eps the eps of any one segment does not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to any one segment but rather represents a direct equity interest in idacorp s assets and liabilities as a whole 
return on year end common equity utility operations this section discusses ipc s utility operations  which are subject to regulation by  among others  the state public utility commissions of idaho and oregon and by the ferc 
generation ipc relies on its hydroelectric plants for a significant portion of its power supply 
the availability of hydroelectric generation can significantly affect the amount of net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  that ipc incurs 
most  but not all  of the net power supply costs are recovered through the rates charged to customers 
lower hydroelectric generation increases net power supply costs  thereby increasing the amount of these costs that ipc must absorb 
ipc s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand usually occurring in the summer 
ipc s record system peak of  mw occurred on july  peak summer demand in was  mw on june and peak winter demand for the year was  mw on january ipc was able to meet system load requirements and off system sales requirements and had sufficient system reserves in place 
ipc s integrated resource plan irp reports that customers use of electricity continues to grow especially during the summer months 
ipc projects that summer peaks could grow by an average of percent per year over the ten year irp planning period 
in  ipc experienced its fifth consecutive year of below normal hydroelectric generating conditions 
the national weather service northwest river forecast center reports april through july inflow to brownlee reservoir for totaled million acre feet maf  which is percent of the year average 
the total annual brownlee inflow for was maf  which the river forecast center reports is percent of average 
below average stream flow conditions are continuing for a sixth consecutive year in the river forecast center forecast released on march  indicates brownlee inflow for april through july is expected to total maf  or percent of average 
snow pack accumulation was percent of average on march  storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee at the end of december was percent of average 
october  storage in these reservoirs  which is considered carryover storage into water year  was only percent of average 
the flows in the snake river at several measurement locations are at or near record lows 
the continuing below average hydrologic conditions will reduce ipc s hydroelectric generation  and require it to use wholesale purchases from the energy markets and higher cost thermal generation when necessary to meet its energy needs in generation from ipc s hydroelectric facilities is expected to be million mwh in  compared to million mwh in and normal generation of million mwh 
the following table presents ipc s system generation mwh of total generation total total system system hydroelectric thermal generation hydroelectric thermal generation normal a a normal hydroelectric generation represents the annual average based on median conditions  using stream flows  adjusted to the level of depletion  and observed generation for normal thermal represents average generation for the past five years 
general business revenue the following table presents ipc s general business revenues and mwh sales for the last three years revenue mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total vs 
rates lower average rates  resulting from the pca  decreased general business revenue million 
the decrease in pca revenues was approximately million 
this was partially offset by a million increase due to new base rates beginning on june  the general rate case and the pca are discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues general rate case and regulatory issues deferred power supply costs idaho  customers an increase in general business customers improved revenue million during ipc is experiencing strong customer growth in its service territory  adding nearly  general business customers in the last months  a percent increase 
similar growth is expected to continue in and beyond  contract expiration the expiration in march of a take or pay contract with fmc astaris caused a million decrease in revenues for fmc astaris  formerly ipc s largest volume customer  closed its plants late in but was required under the contract to pay ipc for generation capacity regardless of delivery  and usage revenues decreased approximately million during mainly due to cooler summer weather 
cooling degree days for this year were percent less than  which had unusually hot summer temperatures 
cooling degree days are a common measure used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for air conditioning 
vs 
rates decreased average rates  resulting from the pca  reduced revenue million  contract expiration revenues decreased million due to the expiration in march of the take or pay contract with fmc astaris  customers a percent increase in general business customers increased revenue million  and usage milder fall and winter weather and other usage factors reduced revenues by approximately million 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
revenues from off system sales grew significantly over due mainly to increased volumes sold 
the increased volumes sold are largely a result of power supply hedge activity in late spring based on temporarily improved hydroelectric generation 
although overall hydroelectric generating conditions were below normal  may precipitation was above normal and reservoir storage space was limited 
consequently  ipc generated more hydroelectric power than previously planned for may and june earlier hedge purchase activity combined with increased hydroelectric generation resulted in surplus energy 
vs 
revenues from off system sales increased due principally to higher average prices in the wholesale electricity markets 
other revenues vs 
other revenues increased million over due mainly to the following in december  ipc recorded approximately million related to the recovery of lost revenue resulting from ipc s irrigation load reduction program 
the recovery will be included as part of ipc s annual pca beginning on june  this matter is discussed further in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs idaho  ipc recognized approximately million of revenue due to the ipuc order approving settlement no 
 which relates to the calculation of ipc s taxes for purposes of test year income tax expense in the idaho general rate case 
as a result of this settlement  ipc is recording a regulatory asset of approximately million from june  through may  ipc will begin collecting this amount beginning in june with an adjustment to rates  and in july  ipc recognized million of revenue from an agreement with the bonneville power administration for the release of  acre feet of storage water from brownlee reservoir 
this amount has been included in the pca and will result in a benefit to ipc s idaho customers in the next pca year 
vs 
other revenues did not change materially from to purchased power purchased power purchases load reduction costs mwh purchased cost per mwh purchased vs 
the increase in purchased power expense is mostly due to a percent increase in volumes purchased 
the increased volumes purchased are a result of power supply hedge activity based on expectations of reduced hydroelectric generation due to continued below normal water conditions 
load reduction costs decreased from million to zero due to the expiration in march of the fmc astaris voluntary load reduction program  which is discussed further in regulatory issues fmc astaris settlement agreement 
vs 
volumes purchased increased due principally to two factors unplanned outages at ipc s thermal plants and increased sales to general business customers 
load reduction costs decreased million due to the expiration of the fmc astaris voluntary load reduction program in march fuel expense the following table presents ipc s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants fuel expense thermal mwh generated cost per mwh vs 
fuel expenses increased in mainly due to a six percent rise in generation 
the increase in generation resulted from a return to normal operations at valmy  which produced percent more in than in see discussion of the outage at the valmy plant below 
this increase was partially offset by a percent reduction in generation from the boardman plant  which was offline for a longer period in in order to perform an upgrade to the turbine generator 
vs 
fuel expense decreased in due primarily to increased unplanned outages 
the most significant outage involved one of the two units of the valmy plant 
as the unit was being returned to service after an unplanned outage  a breakdown occurred  unrelated to the completed maintenance  forcing the unit out of service from late june to early september in the unit was repaired and modernized controls and protection systems are in place 
additional maintenance was completed during the outage that minimized the planned maintenance outage period for the unit 
ipc owns percent of the valmy plant and is not the plant operator 
coal supply the valmy plant has experienced problems with its coal supply  delivery and resulting coal inventory level 
during  delivery service from the coal mines to valmy was unpredictable 
in addition  there have been several mine production and quality issues that have reduced coal availability 
these factors have negatively impacted the plant s coal inventory level and ipc and sierra pacific power company  valmy s co owner and operator  continue to address the problem 
ipc expects these problems to continue during the preferred valmy coal inventory level is days at full load  the current coal inventory level is days at full load 
to date  generation has not been negatively impacted by the coal inventory level 
ipc and sierra pacific power company have an agreement in place to modify plant operations if inventory drops below days at full load 
pca pca expense represents the effect of ipc s pca regulatory mechanism  which is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs idaho 
in  and  actual net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  exceeded those anticipated in the annual pca forecast  resulting in the deferral of a portion of those costs to subsequent years when they are to be recovered in rates 
as the revenues are being recovered  the deferred balances are amortized 
the following table presents the components of pca expense current year net power supply cost deferral fmc astaris and irrigation program cost deferral amortization of prior year authorized balances write offs of disallowed costs settlement agreement total power cost adjustment other operations and maintenance expenses vs 
other operations and maintenance expenses increased million due mainly to the following an increase in payroll expense of million for an employee incentive program  which was partially triggered by the settlement relating to the irrigation load reduction program  a write off of million related to disallowed items in the idaho general rate case  and increases in transmission expense of million primarily due to the increase in purchased power 
vs 
other operations and maintenance expenses increased million due principally to thefollowing qualified pension plan expenses increased million  maintenance of thermal plants rose million due to increased unplanned outages  primarily at the valmy plant  and transmission maintenance increased million  predominantly from an increase in tree trimming and pole maintenance costs of million  and because of insurance proceeds of million received in related to a outage

energy marketing ie wound down its power marketing operations  closed its business locations and sold its forward book of electricity trading contracts to sempra energy trading in as part of the sale of the forward book of electricity trading contracts  ie entered into an indemnity agreement with sempra energy trading  guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
the indemnity agreement has been accounted for in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others and did not have a material effect on idacorp s financial statements

see also note of idacorp s consolidated financial statements for information related to restructuring costs of ie 
on december   ie received a million cash payment from overton power district no 
for final settlement 
overton had a million long term receivable with ie  and this payment resulted in a million expense to ie in december in addition  ie recorded a write down of million related to this receivable in the second quarter of these write downs are included in energy marketing operating expenses on idacorp s consolidated statement of income 
ida west in  ida west discontinued its project development operations 
this decision resulted from the implementation of idacorp s new corporate strategy 
this strategy does not include the development or acquisition of merchant generation  which was ida west s focus 
currently  ida west continues to manage its independent power projects with a reduced workforce 
impairment charges  as discussed below  negatively affected ida west s earnings in both and garnet impairment in  garnet  a wholly owned subsidiary of ida west  entered into a purchased power agreement with ipc to provide energy to be produced by garnet s proposed natural gas fired plant 
due to changes in the electricity industry  financing of the project on acceptable terms under the purchased power agreement became impracticable 
in  ida west wrote down million of its investment in equipment related to garnet 
at that time  the site remained viable for future generation development 
in  the original purchased power agreement was mutually terminated 
also in  ipc issued a formal request for proposal rfp seeking bids for the construction of up to megawatts mw of additional generation 
the rfp specifically prohibited affiliates of ipc  including ida west  from bidding 
while one bid proposed acquisition and use of the garnet site  a different bid was selected 
based on the termination of the purchased power agreement  the results of the rfp process and the decision to discontinue project development operations  ida west determined that recovery of its remaining million investment in the garnet site development costs was uncertain and an impairment charge for the entire amount was recorded 
each of these impairments is presented on the consolidated statement of income as other operating expenses 
joint ventures based on management s new corporate strategy  ida west s investments in four joint ventures were evaluated for impairment in as a result  million in impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of to partially impair two of the joint ventures 
this impairment is presented on the consolidated statement of income as other expense 
there was no impairment identified for in addition  a million bad debt reserve was established in on a note receivable from a partner in one of the joint ventures 
this reserve is presented on the consolidated statement of income as other operating expenses 
no further reserve was necessary for income taxes status of audit proceedings in  idacorp settled all issues related to the internal revenue service s examination of its federal income tax returns for the years through applicable state tax return amendments were completed in and settled 
the settlement resulted in a benefit of million in and million in  as the deficiencies assessed were less than previously accrued 
in  ipc settled federal income tax deficiencies for the years and related to its partnership investment in the bridger coal company 
ipc had previously accrued sufficient amounts to satisfy the and deficiencies 
in  ipc settled the years through the settlement resulted in deficiencies that were less than previously accrued  enabling ipc to decrease income tax expense by approximately million 
during  the internal revenue service will begin its examination of idacorp s through tax years 
management believes that an adequate provision for income taxes and related interest charges has been made for the open years and after 
the accrued amounts are classified as a current liability in taxes accrued 
management cannot predict with certainty which financial accounts or tax adjustments will be chosen by the irs for examination 
idacorp intends to vigorously defend its tax positions 
it is possible that material differences in actual outcomes  costs and exposures relative to current estimates  or material changes in such estimates  could have a material adverse effect on idacorp s consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory settlement in  ipc and the ipuc finalized an income tax issue from ipc s idaho general rate case 
the issue concerned the regulatory accounting treatment for the capitalized overhead cost tax method ipc adopted in the idacorp federal income tax return 
as a result of the settlement  a million regulatory tax liability was reversed  creating a tax benefit 
tax accounting method change in  idacorp filed its federal income tax return and adopted a change to ipc s tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs 
the former method allocated such costs primarily to the construction of plant  while the new method allocates such costs to both construction of plant and the production of electricity 
the tax accounting method change decreased income tax expense by million  of which million was attributable to and prior tax years  and million was attributable to the tax year 
the decrease to tax expense was a result of deductions on the applicable tax returns of costs that were capitalized into fixed assets for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income tax expense was not provided because the prescribed regulatory accounting method does not allow for inclusion of such deferred tax expense in current rates 
regulated enterprises are required to recognize such adjustments as regulatory assets if it is probable that such amounts will be recovered from customers in future rates 
tax credits ifs generates federal income tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits related to its investments in affordable housing and historic rehabilitation developments 
ifs generated tax credits of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
american jobs creation act of in october  the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the act  which may have tax implications for idacorp and ipc 
one provision of the act with potential implications for the companies relates to manufacturing tax incentives for the production of electricity beginning in taxpayers will be able to deduct a percentage three percent in and  six percent in through  and nine percent in and thereafter of the lesser of their qualified production activities income or their taxable income 
management is currently reviewing this and other aspects of the act to determine the impact on the companies 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows for were million and million  respectively 
idacorp s operating cash flows decreased million in as a result of reduced receipts from ipc s general business customers of million and an million decrease in net operating cash flows from ie 
in  ie received million from the sale of its forward book of electricity trading contracts and collected million on a note receivable from overton power district no 
these decreases in were partially offset by a million reduction in income taxes paid 
ipc s operating cash flows have increased million from as a result of a million decrease in income taxes paid to idacorp during the year  partially offset by a decrease of million in receipts from general business customers 
in  net cash provided by operating activities will be driven by ipc  where general business revenues and the costs to supply power to general business customers have the greatest impact on operating cash flows 
as ipc s service territory enters the sixth consecutive year of below normal water conditions  the company expects to rely more on higher cost thermal generation and wholesale power purchases to meet its energy needs in thus  it is expected that ipc s pca will be higher than the pca 
environmental regulation costs ipc anticipates million in annual operating costs for environmental facilities during hydroelectric facility expenses account for million of this total and million is related to thermal plant operating expenses 
from through  total environmental related operating costs are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenses related to the hydroelectric facilities account for million and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million during this period 
working capital the changes in working capital are due primarily to an increase in deferred income taxes of million as a result of changes in temporary differences between pre tax financial income and taxable income  an increase of million in current maturities of long term debt due to the differences in first mortgage bonds due in and  a decrease in notes payable of million due to the pay down of commercial paper and an increase of million in accounts payable due mainly to the accrual of payroll expenses associated with an employee incentive plan 
pension expense and contributions total pension expenses in were million and pension plan contributions were million for the qualified and non qualified plans 
these amounts are not expected to change materially in insurance expenses ipc forecasts that its medical insurance costs will increase to approximately million  approximately million above actual amounts 
rising health care costs are the principal contributor to this increase 
dividend reduction in september  idacorp s annual dividend was reduced to per share from per share 
this action was taken in order to strengthen idacorp s financial position  and its ability to fund ipc s growing capital expenditure needs 
the dividend reduction was also made to improve cash flows and help maintain credit ratings

i amounts include the obligations of various subsidiaries with the exception of ipc  which is shown separately 
off balance sheet arrangements the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes establish operational  reclamation and closure standards that must be met during and upon completion of mining activities 
these obligations mandate that mine property be restored consistent with specific standards and the approved reclamation plan 
the mining operations at the bridger coal company are subject to these reclamation and closure requirements 
ipc has guaranteed the performance of reclamation activities of its bridger coal company joint venture 
this guarantee  which is renewed each december  was million at december  bridger coal has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs and expects that the fund will be sufficient to cover all such costs 
because of the existence of the fund  the estimated fair value as well as the impact on the consolidated financial statements of this guarantee was minimal 
in august  ie sold its forward book of electricity trading contracts to sempra energy trading 
as part of the sale  ie entered into an indemnity agreement with sempra energy trading  guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
the impact of this guarantee on the consolidated financial statements was minimal 
credit ratings s p on november   s p announced that it had lowered the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp and ipc 
the companies commercial paper rating was affirmed at a  and the rating outlooks for both companies are stable 
s p stated that its decision reflects weakened financial ratios that have resulted from a combination of sustained drought conditions on the snake river that have depressed ipc s hydro production and increased deferred power costs  a disappointing general rate case ruling by the ipuc  partly mitigated by the approval of a settlement agreement on september   which granted ipc s position on income tax issues  and more than million of expected capital requirements by ipc 
s p stated that these pressures resulted in a financial profile that is weak even for the current bbb corporate credit rating 
further  s p stated that two key issues that would determine future ratings movement were water flows in the snake river and future rate case rulings by the ipuc 
moody s on december   moody s announced that it had lowered the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp and the corporate credit ratings and long term and short term ratings of ipc 
the rating outlooks for both companies are stable 
moody s stated that the downgrade of ipc s ratings reflected expected weaker cash flow coverage of interest and debt  the likelihood for continued negative free cash flow over the next few years  with internally generated funds falling short of meeting the dividend requirements of idacorp and significant utility related capital spending  persistent drought conditions that are likely to result in higher supply costs  not all of which are recoverable under ipc s power cost adjustment mechanism  the final resolution this fall of ipc s rate case  which resulted in a revenue increase of a little more than half of ipc s updated request  and the likely need for additional support from the ipuc in future rate proceedings as ipc adds new generation and transmission infrastructure to help meet customer and load growth and ensure reliability of service 
according to moody s  the downgrade of idacorp s ratings reflected the weaker credit profile of ipc  which is by far the largest source of cash flow in the form of dividends to the parent company 
moody s stated that  with the continuing negative free cash flow trend for ipc  idacorp may need to depend more on dividends from its riskier non utility subsidiaries to meet its own fixed obligations and common dividend to shareholders  even though management has committed to a back to basics strategy of focusing on its regulated business 
in addition  moody s assigned a baa rating to idacorp s three year million senior unsecured bank credit facility and a baa rating to ipc s three year million senior unsecured bank credit facility 
both facilities expire on march  moody s stated that the ratings assigned to the bank credit facilities reflected the pari passu ranking of the facilities with each company s other senior unsecured obligations 
the facilities serve as part of the alternate liquidity for each company s commercial paper program and contain a maximum percent total debt to total capitalization ratio covenant with a material adverse change clause as part of the representations and warranties relating to each credit extension 
in moody s view  the existence of the material adverse change clause detracts from the quality of the facilities since it could preclude access to funds at the time of greatest need 
fitch on january   fitch announced that it has lowered the long term ratings of idacorp and ipc and the short term debt ratings at ipc 
the rating outlooks for both companies are stable 
fitch stated that the downgrade of ipc s ratings reflected ipc s increased earnings volatility and debt burden relative to cash flows  primarily due to the adverse effect of ongoing drought conditions in southern idaho and the lower than expected general rate case order issued by the ipuc in according to fitch  consolidated leverage has also been adversely affected by higher non utility debt 
fitch noted that the revised ratings also considered the moderating effect of ipc s pca mechanism  which has enabled the company to maintain solid interest coverage ratios  the positive impact of a more conservative corporate business profile and ongoing efforts to reduce financial leverage 
fitch stated that the stable rating outlook assumes a return to normal stream flows and hydroelectric generation output in access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality 
these downgrades are expected to increase the cost of new debt and other issued securities going forward

capital requirements the following table presents idacorp s and ipc s expected capital requirements from through millions of dollars ipc capital expenditures construction expenditures excluding afdc generating facilities hydroelectric thermal total generating facilities transmission lines and substations distribution lines and substations general total construction expenditures excluding afdc long term debt maturities other total ipc ifs investments ifs long term debt maturities other total idacorp variations in the timing and amounts of capital expenditures will result from regulatory and environmental factors  load growth and other resource acquisition needs and the timing of relicensing expenditures 
internal cash generation after dividends is expected to provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through the contribution from internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs 
idacorp s internally generated cash after dividends is expected to provide percent of capital requirements  where capital requirements are defined as utility construction expenditures  excluding afdc  plus other regulated and non regulated investments 
this excludes mandatory or optional principal payments on debt obligations 
ipc s construction expenditures represent percent of these capital requirements 
idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital requirements with internally generated funds and with increased reliance on externally financed capital 
utility construction program ipc s construction expenditures were million in  million in and million in aging facilities  relicensing costs and projected load growth are expected to increase construction expenditures over the next three years 
ipc s coal fired plants are approaching their fourth decade of service and plant utilization has increased due to both load growth and reduced hydroelectric generation resulting from below normal water conditions 
these factors result in increased upgrade and replacement requirements and plant additions such as the bennett mountain power plant  which is currently estimated to cost million  million of which had been incurred as of december  this power plant is discussed in more detail later in the md a in regulatory issues 
ipc filed its irp with the ipuc and the opuc in august the irp includes several elements requiring significant capital expenditures in the future 
two of these projects are included in the utility capital expenditure forecast million of construction costs for a mw combustion turbine peaking resource expected to be operational in mid  and million of planning costs for a million mw coal fired plant expected to be operational in additional generation needs identified in the irp are expected to be met via purchased power agreements 
these agreements are projected to be million average mw in and million average mw in ipc has also issued an rfp for purchased power agreements for mw of wind powered generation  which is not included in the capital expenditure forecast 
continuing load growth also requires that ipc add to its transmission system and distribution facilities to provide new service and to maintain reliability 
planned expenditures include distribution lines for new customers and several high voltage transmission lines 
ipc has no nuclear involvement and its future construction plans do not include development of any nuclear generation 
ipc s aging hydroelectric facilities require continuing upgrades and component replacement 
in addition  costs related to relicensing hydroelectric facilities are expected to increase substantially 
the three year construction program anticipates million of upgrades to existing hydroelectric facilities and million of costs associated with relicensing of hydroelectric facilities 
based upon present environmental laws and regulations  ipc estimates its capital expenditures for environmental matters  excluding afdc  will total million 
studies and measures related to environmental concerns at ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million and investments in environmental equipment and facilities at the thermal plants account for million 
from through  environmental related capital expenditures  excluding afdc  are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenses related to ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million

the complaints alleged that  during the purported class period  idacorp and or certain of its officers and or directors made materially false and misleading statements or omissions about the company s financial outlook in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b  thereby causing investors to purchase the company s common stock at artificially inflated prices 
more specifically  the complaints alleged that idacorp failed to disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts which were known to defendants or recklessly disregarded by them idacorp failed to appreciate the negative impact that lower volatility and reduced pricing spreads in the western wholesale energy market would have on its marketing subsidiary  ie  idacorp would be forced to limit its origination activities to shorter term transactions due to increasing regulatory uncertainty and continued deterioration of creditworthy counterparties  idacorp failed to discount for the fact that ipc may not recover from the lingering effects of the prior year s regional drought and as a result of the foregoing  defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about idacorp and their earnings projections 
the powell complaint also alleged that the defendants conduct artificially inflated the price of the company s common stock 
the actions sought an unspecified amount of damages  as well as other forms of relief 
by order dated august   the court consolidated the powell and shorthouse cases for pretrial purposes  and ordered the plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint within days

western energy proceedings at the ferc ie and ipc are involved in a number of ferc proceedings arising out of the western energy situation and claims that dysfunctions in the organized california markets contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices in pacific northwest spot markets  and may have been the result of manipulations of gas or electric power markets 
they include proceedings involving the chargeback provisions of the california power exchange calpx participation agreement  which was triggered when a participant defaulted on a payment to the calpx 
upon such a default  other participants were required to pay their allocated share of the default amount to the calpx 
this provision was first triggered by the southern california edison default and later by the pacific gas and electric company default 
the ferc ordered the calpx to rescind all chargeback actions related to the southern california edison and pacific gas and electric company liabilities 
the calpx is awaiting further orders from the ferc and bankruptcy court before distributing the funds it collected under the chargeback mechanism  efforts by the state of california to obtain refunds for a portion of the spot market sales prices from sellers of electricity into california from october  through june  california is claiming that the prices were not just and reasonable and were not in compliance with the federal power act 
the ferc issued an order on refund liability on march  which multiple parties  including ie  sought rehearing on 
on october   the ferc denied the requests for rehearing and required the california independent system operator cal iso to make a compliance filing regarding refund amounts within five months  which has since been delayed until at least april on may   the ferc issued an order clarifying its earlier refund orders and denying a request by certain parties to present as evidence an earlier settlement between the california public utilities commission and el paso related to manipulation of gas pipeline capacity claiming that the settlement dollars california is receiving from el paso billion are duplicative of the ferc order changing the gas component of its refund methodology 
the ferc denied requests for rehearing on november  on december   ie and others petitioned the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit for review of the ferc s orders on california refunds 
as additional ferc orders have been issued  further petitions for review have been filed  including by ie  and have been consolidated with the appeals already pending before the ninth circuit 
on september   the ninth circuit convened the first of its case management proceedings  a procedure reserved to help organize complex cases 
on october  the ninth circuit severed several issues related to ferc s refund jurisdiction and established a schedule for briefing and oral argument 
at december   with respect to the calpx chargeback and the california refund proceedings discussed above  the calpx and the cal iso owed million and million  respectively  for energy sales made to them by ipc in november and december ie has accrued a reserve of million against these receivables 
this reserve was calculated taking into account the uncertainty of collection  given the california energy situation 
based on the reserve recorded as of december   idacorp believes that the future collectibility of these receivables or any potential refunds ordered by the ferc would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  the pacific northwest refund proceedings wherein it was argued that the spot market in the pacific northwest was affected by the dysfunction in the california market  warranting refunds 
the ferc rejected this claim on june  and denied rehearing on november  and february  the ferc orders were appealed to the ninth circuit 
on july   the city of seattle petitioned the ninth circuit requesting the court to direct the ferc to permit additional evidence consisting of audiotapes of enron trader conversations and a delay in the briefing schedule in the pacific northwest refund 
on august   the ninth circuit held the briefing schedule in abeyance pending resolution of the motion to offer additional evidence 
on august  and august   respectively  the ferc and a group of parties  including ie  filed their answers in opposition to the motion to offer additional evidence 
on september   the ninth circuit denied the city of seattle s motion without prejudice to renew the request in briefing in the pacific northwest refund case and established a briefing schedule with final briefs due in july of ie and ipc are unable to predict the outcome of these matters  and two ferc show cause orders which resulted from a ruling of the ninth circuit that the ferc permit the california parties in the california refund proceeding to submit materials to the ferc demonstrating market manipulation by various sellers of electricity into california 
on june   the ferc ordered a large number of parties including ipc to show cause why certain trading practices did not constitute gaming gaming or anomalous market behavior partnership in violation of the cal iso and calpx tariffs 
on october   ipc reached agreement with the ferc staff on the show cause orders 
the gaming settlement was approved by the ferc on march  the ferc approved the motion to dismiss the partnership proceeding on january  although the orders establishing the scope of the show cause proceedings are presently the subject of review petitions in the ninth circuit  the order dismissing ipc from the partnership proceedings was not the subject of rehearing requests 
eight parties have requested rehearing of the ferc s march  order approving the gaming settlement but the ferc has not yet acted on those requests 
on july   californians for renewable energy filed a motion with the ferc in connection with the california refund  the pacific northwest refund and the market manipulation cases requesting the ferc to revise its approach to the western energy situation by revoking market based rate authority and replacing it with cost of service rates and requiring refunds back to the date of the order granting the market based rate authority  revising long term contracts entered into during the western energy situation and deferring new and rejecting existing refund settlements 
on september   californians for renewable energy filed a motion to withdraw its july  pleading 
by operation of law  the withdrawal was effective september  these matters are discussed in more detail in note to idacorp s consolidated financial statements 
other legal proceedings idacorp  ipc and or ie are involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings  discussed above and in detail in note to idacorp s consolidated financial statements 
the companies believe they have meritorious defenses to all lawsuits and legal proceedings where they have been named as defendants 
resolution of any of these matters will take time  and the companies cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings 
the companies believe that their reserves are adequate for these matters 
other legal issues idaho power company transmission line rights of way across fort hall indian reservation ipc has multiple transmission lines that cross the shoshone bannock tribes fort hall indian reservation near the city of pocatello in southeastern idaho 
ipc has been working since to renew four of the right of way permits for five of the transmission lines  which have stated permit expiration dates between and ipc filed applications with the us department of the interior  bureau of indian affairs  to renew the four rights of way for years  including payment of the independently appraised value of the rights of way to the tribes and the tribal allottees who own portions of the rights of way 
due to the lack of definitive legal guidelines for valuation of the permit renewals  ipc is in the process of negotiating mutually acceptable renewal terms with the tribes and allottees 
the parties are pursuing a possible year renewal of the permits including all pre renewal periods for a total payment of approximately million to the tribes and allottees 
ipc  the tribes and the bureau of indian affairs are currently working through the process of finalizing the agreement  including obtaining the requisite consents from the allottees 
the parties hope to obtain the required consents early in on december   ipc filed an application with the ipuc seeking an accounting order regarding the treatment of this transaction 
on february   the ipuc issued an order approving ipc s application 
environmental issues idaho water management issues ipc holds water rights for generation purposes at each of its hydroelectric projects 
the state of idaho is experiencing its sixth consecutive year of below normal precipitation and stream flows 
these conditions have exacerbated a developing water shortage in the state  which is manifested by a number of water issues that are of interest to ipc because of their potential impacts on generation at ipc s hydroelectric projects including declining snake river base flows and recharge to the eastern snake plain aquifer  a large underground aquifer that has been estimated to hold between million acre feet of water 
with respect to base flows  observed records suggest that the base flows in the snake river  particularly between ipc s twin falls and swan falls projects  have been in decline for several decades 
the yearly average flow measured below swan falls declined at an average rate of cubic feet per second cfs per year during the period  and observed stream flow gains between twin falls and lower salmon falls  which are largely attributed to base flow contribution  declined at a rate of cfs year over the same period 
low flow in the snake river near hagerman  idaho continues to be observed several river gauges in that area are recording the lowest snake river flows since the early s 
regarding aquifer recharge  the snake river  at various places throughout its reach from rexburg  idaho to king hill  idaho  is connected to the eastern snake plain aquifer 
in certain times of the year  the flows into the snake river below milner dam are heavily dependent on the outflow from springs that are connected to and fed by the eastern snake plain aquifer in the thousand springs reach of the snake river 
the majority of ipc s hydroelectric projects are below milner dam 
ground water irrigators and surface water irrigators in southern idaho are involved in a conflict regarding shortages of irrigation water 
one solution that has been offered is aquifer recharge  or using surface water supplies to increase ground water supplies by allowing the water to sink into the earth in porous locations 
ipc believes this solution will impact its senior water rights and therefore conflicts with state law and will likely reduce the amount of water available for generation in ipc s hydroelectric plants 
in august  the idaho department of water resources designated portions of the eastern snake plain aquifer that are tributary to the thousand springs reach of the snake river as a ground water management area due to the effect  exacerbated by several years of drought  of junior priority ground water withdrawals on senior surface water rights 
subsequently  in late and early  junior ground water interests entered into a stipulated agreement with certain affected senior surface water users in an effort to mitigate the effects of ground water pumping 
the idaho department of water resources established two ground water districts to facilitate the operation of the agreement 
however  in  surface water users that were not parties to the stipulated agreement filed delivery calls with the idaho department of water resources  demanding that it manage ground water withdrawals pursuant to the prior appropriation doctrine of first in time is first in right and curtail junior ground water rights that are depleting the aquifer and affecting flows to senior surface water rights 
these delivery calls resulted in several administrative actions before the idaho department of water resources and a judicial action before the state district court in ada county  idaho 
because ipc holds water rights in the thousand springs area that are dependent on spring flows and the overall condition of the eastern snake plain aquifer  ipc intervened in these actions to protect its interests and encourage the development of a long term management plan that will protect the aquifer from further depletion 
in march  the state of idaho negotiated an interim agreement between various ground and surface water users in an effort to allow the state to develop short and long term goals and objectives for effectively managing the eastern snake plain aquifer and ensuring that senior water rights are protected consistent with the prior appropriation doctrine and state law 
as part of the interim agreement  the pending administrative and judicial processes are stayed until march  and the idaho legislature directed the natural resources interim committee  a standing committee  to meet and evaluate ways to stabilize and properly manage the aquifer 
this interim committee has been meeting with interested parties since march of in an effort to resolve the pending controversies 
ipc is participating in that process as necessary to protect its existing hydroelectric generation water rights 
on january   seven surface water irrigation entities from above milner dam that are not parties to the march interim agreement submitted a delivery call letter to the director of the idaho department of water resources requesting that the director administer and deliver their senior natural flow and storage water rights pursuant to idaho law 
the irrigation entities contend that existing data reflects that senior surface water rights above milner dam have been reduced by approximately  acre feet  a percent reduction  over the past six years due  in part  to junior groundwater pumping from the eastern snake plain aquifer and that these reductions have resulted in cumulative shortages in natural flow and storage water accrual in american falls reservoir  a us bureau of reclamation reservoir that supplies a portion of their senior water rights 
these same entities also filed a petition with the idaho department of water resources for water rights administration and designation of the eastern snake plain aquifer as a ground water management area 
on february   the idaho ground water appropriators  inc  an idaho non profit corporation organized to promote and represent the interests of groundwater users  petitioned to intervene in the delivery call action 
on february   the director of the idaho department of water resources issued an interlocutory order establishing a contested case under the department s procedural rules in response to the delivery call letter 
the order granted the idaho ground water appropriators  inc s petition to intervene and requested that the surface water irrigation entities supply the department with additional information relative to their claim for delivery of water within days of the date of the order 
similar to the surface water irrigation entities  ipc holds storage rights in american falls reservoir 
to the extent that groundwater pumping and the reduced surface water flows have impacted american falls storage water rights  ipc s storage rights have also been impacted 
as such  ipc submitted a letter to the idaho department of water resources in support of the delivery call and asked the department to grant ipc intervenor status in the pending contested case 
the idaho ground water appropriators  inc filed a motion opposing ipc s intervention 
regulatory issues general rate case idaho ipc filed its idaho general rate case with the ipuc on october  ipc originally requested approximately million annually in additional revenue  an average percent increase to base rates 
on rebuttal  ipc lowered its overall requested increase to million annually  an average of percent 
the ipuc approved an increase in ipc s electric rates of million  an average of percent  in an order issued on may  the rate increase became effective on june  in the order  the ipuc approved a return on equity of percent  compared to the percent ipc requested  an overall rate of return of percent  compared to the percent requested by ipc 
the ipuc reduced the billion in rate base requested for ipc s idaho jurisdiction to billion 
additionally  the ipuc approved higher rates for residential and small commercial customers during the summer months to encourage conservation 
the percent higher summer rate applies to monthly usage over kilowatt hours 
the ipuc also ordered time of use rates to be phased in for industrial customers  asked ipc to submit a proposal for a conservation program for industrial customers and ordered increased low income weatherization funding of million annually 
the ipuc also noted two other issues to be addressed in separate proceedings and potentially handled in workshops instead of formal hearings 
these issues are investigating approaches to removing financial disincentives to ipc for investing in cost effective energy efficiency and clean distributed generation and investigating various cost of service issues raised in the general rate case  including those associated with load growth 
during the year  initial workshops were held on both issues 
the ipuc disallowed several costs in the idaho general rate case order  including million annually related to the determination of ipc s income tax expense  million of incentive payments capitalized in prior years and million of capitalized pension expense 
on june   ipc filed with the ipuc a petition for reconsideration of these and other items 
on july   the ipuc granted this petition in part  agreeing to reconsider the issue relating to the determination of ipc s income tax expense and  in light of the ipuc staff s computational errors  ordering rates increased by approximately million on or before august  ipc recorded an impairment of assets of million related to the disallowed incentive payments and the disallowed capitalized pension expenses 
on september   the ipuc issued separate orders approving two settlement agreements entered into on august  between ipc and the ipuc staff 
settlement no 
 approved by the ipuc in order no 
 relates to the calculation of ipc s taxes for purposes of test year income tax expense 
in the idaho general rate case order  the ipuc adopted the use of a historic five year average income tax rate to calculate ipc s income tax expense 
settlement no 
approved the modification of the general rate case order to utilize ipc s statutory income tax rates to compute test year income tax expense 
as a result  ipc will compute and record monthly during the period june  through may  a regulatory asset with interest accrued at a rate of one percent per annum of approximately million 
rates will increase on june  to reflect the ongoing impact of the tax expense 
approximately million of this amount was recorded in as other operating revenue 
settlement no 
allows ipc to continue its compliance with the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and associated treasury regulations  and will allow ipc to continue to receive the benefits of accelerated depreciation 
settlement no 
 approved by the ipuc in order no 
 resolved outstanding issues related to an unplanned outage at one of the two units of the valmy plant in the summer of  a matter relating to the expense adjustment rate for growth component of the pca and regulatory accounting issues related to a tax accounting method change in in settlement no 
 ipc and the ipuc staff agreed that the ipuc will not examine the cost of replacement power and a possible pca adjustment resulting from the valmy plant outage  and the expense adjustment rate for growth component of the pca will continue at its existing value until ipc s next general rate case 
in september  as a result of the order  ipc established a regulatory liability of million with a charge to pca expense 
a monthly credit of approximately  will be included in the pca through may  which will reduce this regulatory liability 
also in september  ipc reversed a million regulatory tax liability by reducing income tax expense 
this regulatory tax liability was established in when ipc changed its tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs 
the final result of ipc s general rate case was a million increase to the base idaho jurisdictional revenue requirement  comprised of million in the initial order  million related to computational errors and million in the order approving settlement no 
ipc plans to file an idaho general rate case with the ipuc in the fall of  requesting rates to be implemented on june  ipc is unable to predict what rate relief  if any  the ipuc will grant 
oregon on september   ipc filed an application with the opuc to increase general rates an average of percent  approximately million annually 
ipc s filing includes a request to introduce summer and non summer rates similar to proposals that were approved in the idaho general rate case 
ipc has not filed for a change to its overall rates in oregon since on october   the opuc suspended ipc s request for a period of time not to exceed nine months from october  to investigate the propriety and reasonableness of the request 
a pre hearing conference and public meeting was held on november  the hearing schedule called for a settlement conference  which began on february   and an evidentiary hearing to begin on may  ipc is unable to predict what rate relief  if any  the opuc will grant 
deferred power supply costs ipc s deferred net power supply costs consisted of the following at december oregon deferral idaho pca current year net power supply cost deferrals deferral for rate year deferral for rate year irrigation lost revenues idaho pca true up awaiting recovery remaining true up authorized may remaining true up authorized may total deferral idaho ipc has a pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
these adjustments are based on forecasts of net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  and the true up of the prior year s forecast 
during the year  percent of the difference between the actual and forecasted costs is deferred with interest 
the ending balance of this deferral  called the true up for the current year s portion and the true up of the true up for the prior years unrecovered portion  is then included in the calculation of the next year s pca 
on april   ipc filed its pca with the ipuc requesting recovery of million above base rates and a proposed effective date of june  on may   the ipuc issued order no 
approving ipc s filing with additional instructions for ipc and the ipuc staff to examine the cost of replacement power attributable to the unplanned outage at the valmy plant in based on the order approving settlement no 
 discussed above  the ipuc will not examine the costs related to this outage 
on may   the ipuc issued order no 
approving ipc s pca filing  with a small adjustment to the original filing 
as approved  ipc s rates were adjusted to collect million above base rates 
on april   the ipuc issued order no 
disallowing recovery of million of lost revenues resulting from the irrigation load reduction program that was in place in ipc believed that this ipuc order was inconsistent with order no 
 dated may   that allowed recovery of such costs  and ipc filed a petition for reconsideration on may  on august   the ipuc issued order no 
denying the petition for reconsideration 
as a result of this order  approximately million was expensed in september ipc believed it was entitled to recover this amount and argued its position before the idaho supreme court on december  on march   the idaho supreme court set aside the ipuc denial of the recovery of lost revenues and remanded the matter to the ipuc to determine the amount of lost revenues to be recovered 
on december   the ipuc issued order no 
allowing ipc to recover million in lost revenues and million in interest 
the recovery will be included as part of ipc s annual pca beginning june  oregon on march  ipc file for an accounting order to defer net power supply costs for the period of march  through february  in anticipation of the low water conditions ipc is currently experiencing 
the net system power supply costs included in this filing was million 
ipc is proposing to use the same methodology for this deferral filing that was accepted in for oregon s share of ipc s net power supply expenses 
ipc is also recovering calendar year excess power supply costs applicable to the oregon jurisdiction 
in two separate orders  the opuc approved rate increases totaling six percent  which was the maximum annual rate of recovery allowed under oregon state law at that time 
these increases were recovering approximately million annually 
during the oregon legislative session  the maximum annual rate of recovery was raised to ten percent under certain circumstances 
ipc requested and received authority to increase the surcharge to ten percent 
as a result of the increased recovery rate  which became effective on april   ipc will recover approximately million annually 
bennett mountain power plant on february   ipc issued a formal rfp seeking bids for the construction of up to mw of additional generation to support the growing seasonal demand for electricity in ipc s service area 
as a result of this process  ipc selected tr as the successful bidder for the construction of the bennett mountain power plant  a mw gas fired generating plant near mountain home  idaho 
tr contracted with siemens westinghouse power corporation to furnish all of the labor  equipment and materials and to perform all of the engineering and construction of the plant 
the estimated project cost  including plant construction and associated transmission system upgrades  is million 
ipc will take ownership of the plant once it is tested and operational 
in january  the ipuc approved ipc s application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity  which will allow ipc to place reasonable and prudent capital costs of the bennett mountain power plant into its idaho base rates when the plant is operational 
ipc made a rate filing with the ipuc on march  to include the investment of approximately million associated with this plant in idaho retail rates 
ipc requested that these costs be included in idaho retail rates effective june  wind down of energy marketing idacorp announced in that ie would wind down its energy marketing operations 
in connection with the wind down  certain matters were identified that required resolution with the ferc  the ipuc and the opuc 
these matters were resolved in all three jurisdictions 
idaho in an ipuc proceeding that began in may  ipc  the ipuc staff and several interested customer groups worked to determine the appropriate compensation ie should provide to ipc for certain transactions between ipc and ie 
the ipuc has issued several orders since then regarding these matters 
order no 
issued on september  covered the time period prior to february order no 
covered the time period from march through march the ipuc also approved ipc s ongoing hedging and risk management strategies in order no 
issued on august  this order formalized ipc s agreement to implement a number of changes to its existing practices for managing risk and initiating hedging purchases and sales 
the million in benefits related to the ferc settlement were included in the pca and credited to idaho retail customers in accordance with the pca methodology 
the parties to the proceeding executed a settlement agreement providing that an additional million be flowed through the pca mechanism to the idaho retail customers from april through december this agreement was filed with the ipuc on february  and approved on march  oregon following ipc s settlement with the ipuc on issues related to ipc s past relationship with ie  ipc approached the opuc to settle the issue of fair compensation to oregon customers related to the terminated electricity supply management services agreement between ipc and ie  as well as any other issues relating to transactions between ipc and ie 
on october   ipc filed a petition with the opuc requesting an accounting order approving a settlement stipulation and authorizing ipc to credit its existing deferral balance of excess power supply costs 
in the proposed settlement  ipc agrees to continue the  monthly credit to customers that began in july through december  and to reduce the existing excess power supply cost deferral balance by a one time credit of  on january  the opuc issued order no 
approving this settlement on november  fmc astaris settlement agreement on january   the ipuc initiated an investigation to examine the load reduction rates contained in the voluntary load reduction agreement between ipc and fmc astaris 
this agreement amended the electric service agreement that governed the delivery of electric service to fmc astaris pocatello  idaho plant  which ceased operations late in on june   ipc and fmc astaris signed and filed a proposed stipulation and settlement agreement with the ipuc and on june   the ipuc approved the stipulation and settlement agreement in order no 
which included the following provisions the voluntary load reduction payments that ipc would have made to fmc astaris through may were decreased million  reducing ipc s overall payments to million 
approximately percent of this million reduction flowed through the pca mechanism as a reduction in costs to idaho retail customers 
fmc astaris dismissed  with prejudice  a declaratory judgment action concerning the fmc astaris contract that it had previously filed against ipc in the fourth judicial district for the state of idaho 
fmc astaris paid ipc approximately million through march to settle the electric service agreement 
ipc s need to purchase power from the wholesale markets decreased during due to the ceased operation of fmc astaris pocatello  idaho plant and settlement of the above mentioned electric service agreement 
public utilities regulatory policy act of as mandated by the enactment of the public utilities regulatory policy act of purpa and the adoption of avoided costs standards by the ipuc and the opuc  ipc has entered into contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
under these contracts  ipc is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside the ipc service territory 
for projects located outside the ipc service territory  ipc is required to purchase the output that ipc has the ability to receive at the facility s requested point of delivery on the ipc system 
the costs associated with these idaho jurisdictional contracts are fully recovered through the pca 
for ipuc jurisdictional projects  projects up to ten mw are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and the opuc to estimate ipc s cost of developing additional generation resources 
for opuc jurisdictional projects  projects up to one mw are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a five year contract term automatically renewable at the end of five years 
the costs associated with these oregon jurisdictional contracts are recovered through general rate case filings 
the oregon provisions are currently being reviewed in an opuc proceeding  as discussed below 
if a purpa project does not qualify for the published avoided costs  then ipc is required to negotiate the terms  prices and conditions with the developer of that project 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location and size and the benefits to the ipc system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
recent activities  including the extension of the federal production tax credit and the expansion of the tax credit for eligibility to solar  geothermal and other forms of generation  resolution of ipuc and opuc purpa related hearings and the december  order by the ipuc increasing the published avoided costs  create a favorable climate for purpa project development during  which may require ipc to enter into additional purpa agreements 
the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements may result in ipc acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices  thus increasing costs to its customers 
additionally  it is highly likely that the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements will add to ipc s surplus during certain times of the year  potentially during off peak hours 
this could also increase costs to ipc s customers 
idaho on june   the ipuc ordered that two separate complaints against ipc be consolidated 
the complaints both relate to the contract terms required by ipc for purpa qualifying facilities 
the specific issues to be addressed by the ipuc were size threshold for standard rates  the distinction between firm and non firm energy and the appropriateness of performance bands and the ability to terminate contractual obligations should retail deregulation be implemented in idaho 
a public hearing was conducted on september  and september  and post hearing briefs were filed on september  the ipuc issued order no 
on november   clarifying the determination of the ten mw size threshold for standard published rates  approving the implementation of performance bands and denying ipc s request for the ability to terminate contractual obligations if retail deregulation were implemented in idaho 
ipc subsequently signed a purchased power agreement with one of the complainants 
oregon in january  the opuc opened a proceeding to review its policies on purpa matters and issue a comprehensive order to address them 
the following issues have been identified for consideration in this proceeding contract length and price structure  size threshold for standard rates  utility tariff content  avoided cost calculation methods  applicability of oregon purpa administrative rules and dispute mediation 
a hearing began on october  briefs on the matter were due january  and oral arguments were held on february  the outcome of these issues is unknown at this time 
idaho renewable energy legislation idaho s interim legislative committee on energy developed a green power tax incentive bill 
the legislation would provide a sales tax exemption on alternative generation equipment used directly in generating electricity using fuel cells  low impact hydro  wind  geothermal resources  cogeneration  sun or landfill gas as the principal source of power 
the alternative generation facility would need to be in excess of five mw to be eligible for the sales tax exemption 
if enacted  the legislation would expire in july ipc is unable to predict whether this bill will become law or what effect it would have on its operations 
integrated resource plan ipc filed its irp with the ipuc and the opuc in august the irp reviews ipc s load and resource situation for the next ten years  analyzes potential supply side and demand side options and identifies near term and long term actions 
the two primary goals of the irp are to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy service within ipc s service area throughout the year planning period and ensure that the portfolio of resources selected balances cost  risk and environmental concerns 
in addition  there are two secondary goals to give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures and to involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way 
the irp is filed every two years with both the ipuc and the opuc 
prior to filing  the irp requires extensive involvement by ipc  the ipuc staff and the opuc staff  as well as customer  technological and environmental representatives and is the starting point for demonstrating prudence in ipc s resource decisions 
public comments concerning ipc s irp were filed with the ipuc by december  on december   ipc filed its response to the filed comments 
ipc expects that the commissions will acknowledge the plan in early the irp includes the following elements  which may require significant capital expenditures in the future mw demand response programs  mw energy efficiency programs  mw wind powered generation  mw geothermal powered generation  mw combined heat and power at customer facilities  mw simple cycle natural gas fired combustion turbine  mw combustion turbine  distributed generation or market purchases  and mw coal fired generation 
the irp identifies specific actions to be taken by ipc prior to the next irp in ipc is in the process of implementing these actions 
during december of  ipc issued two rfps associated with an air conditioning cycling program and on january   ipc issued an rfp for mw of wind powered generation 
during the remainder of  ipc will design demand side programs in coordination with the energy efficiency advisory group and both commissions  issue an rfp for a combustion turbine peaking resource  issue an rfp for a mw combined heat and power co generation facility and issue an rfp for mw of geothermal powered generation 
advanced meter reading on february   the ipuc issued order no 
 which directed ipc to submit a plan no later than march  to replace its existing meters with advanced meters that are capable of both automated meter reading and time of use pricing 
on april   the ipuc issued order no 
 which modified and clarified order no 
the requirement to commence installation in was removed  however  ipc was expected to implement advanced meter reading as soon as practicable  subject to updated analysis showing advanced meter reading to be cost effective for customers 
as ordered by the ipuc  ipc submitted an updated analysis on may  a workshop with the ipuc staff and other interested parties to discuss the analysis was held on may  the ipuc issued order no 
on july   providing interested parties the opportunity to submit comments regarding ipc s updated analysis 
on october   the ipuc issued order no 
 which directed ipc to collaboratively develop and submit a phase one advanced meter reading implementation plan to replace current residential meters with advanced meters in selected service areas 
ipc complied with this order on december  by filing a phase one implementation plan that targeted the emmett  idaho and mccall  idaho areas for installation and implementation 
phase one is estimated to cost million and ipc will include these costs in future rate filings 
since april  approximately  meters have been installed 
ipc will submit a report to the ipuc by december   summarizing the advanced meter reading project and associated benefits and costs 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects ipc  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
ipc recently received new licenses for five of its middle snake river projects 
the license for ipc s malad hydroelectric project expired in and the project will continue to operate under an annual license until the ferc issues a new multi year license 
ipc s hydroelectric project license for the hells canyon complex will expire in and the swan falls project license will expire in ipc is actively pursuing the relicensing of these projects  a process that may continue for the next ten to years 
middle snake river projects the middle snake river projects consist of the bliss  upper salmon falls  lower salmon falls  shoshone falls and cj strike projects 
on august   ipc received the ferc license orders for each of the middle snake river projects 
each license is for a year duration effective august  a central component of each license order is a settlement agreement between ipc and the us fish and wildlife service regarding five snail species that inhabit the middle snake river  which are listed as threatened or endangered species under the esa 
as a basis for the settlement  ipc and the us fish and wildlife service agreed that additional studies and analyses are needed in order to accurately assess the effect  if any  that the middle snake river projects may have on one or more of the listed snail species 
the settlement agreement provides an operational regime for the five projects that will permit six years of studies and analyses of various project operations on the listed snail species  while providing interim protection of the listed species 
after the studies are complete  ipc and the us fish and wildlife service intend to jointly develop a plan that will address project operation and the protection of listed snails for the remainder of the new license terms 
on september   two conservation groups  american rivers and idaho rivers united  filed petitions for rehearing of the orders issuing the licenses for the middle snake river projects 
these petitions ask the ferc to vacate the licensing orders and request a determination from the us fish and wildlife service that the middle snake river projects jeopardize the listed snail species 
on october   the ferc issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration to provide additional time to consider the matters raised by the rehearing requests 
the order further provided that the ferc anticipated issuing an order on the merits of the rehearing requests on or before november  the ferc has yet to issue an order 
on september   idaho rivers united filed a complaint against the us fish and wildlife service in the us district court for the district of idaho seeking judicial review of the biological opinion issued by the us fish and wildlife service on may  on the effect of the relicensing of the middle snake river projects on the listed snail species 
the complaint alleges that the us fish and wildlife service action in entering into and relying on the settlement agreement as a basis for issuing a no jeopardy determination in the biological opinion was arbitrary  capricious and contrary to law and asks the court to reverse the biological opinion and remand it to the us fish and wildlife service for further consideration 
neither the ferc nor ipc are parties to the action 
on november   the us fish and wildlife service filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
on february   the court granted this motion 
several of the new license articles for the middle snake river projects require that ipc file additional information with the ferc either upon license issuance or within  or days following license issuance 
ipc has made these required filings 
many of the new license articles require ipc to develop comprehensive plans for pm e measures and submit them to the ferc for approval 
the plans are due within six months to one year following license issuance and are required to have detailed costs  schedules and methods for implementing the pm e measures 
ipc is also required to consult with certain parties that participated in the relicensing process including state and federal resource agencies  native american indian tribes and non governmental organizations environmental organizations prior to the completion of development and the filing of some of the plans 
the ferc will then review and approve the plans  after which ipc will proceed with implementation of the planned pm e measures 
plans to be developed and approved for each license include white sturgeon conservation  recreation management  middle snake river and cj strike wildlife management area land management  minimum and aesthetic water flows  water quality monitoring  historic properties management  spring habitat protection  fish stocking and operational compliance monitoring 
cost estimates for the plans to implement required pm e measures are million in capital and million in additional annual operation and maintenance expense 
most of the capital expenditures will occur within the first five years of the licenses 
since the plans have not yet been accepted by the ferc  the cost estimates are preliminary 
additionally  cost estimates do not include any pm e measures that may be required as a result of the settlement agreement snail studies and analysis described above 
at december   million of middle snake river project relicensing and compliance costs were in electric plant in service 
the majority of these costs  which were incurred prior to the completion of ipc s recent idaho general rate case  were approved for recovery in rates 
the remaining costs and any future costs will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the rate making process 
malad project the license for the malad project expired on august  ipc filed a new license application in july and will operate the project on an annual license issued under the same terms and conditions of the expired license until the ferc issues a new multi year license 
in september  the ferc issued a final environmental assessment under nepa for the malad project concluding that  with appropriate pm e measures  relicensing the project would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
the cost estimate of the pm e measures is less than million annually 
in december  the us fish and wildlife service submitted the final  no jeopardy biological opinion to the ferc 
the biological opinion is the last piece of information required for the ferc s licensing decision 
ipc anticipates a new multi year license will be issued in at december   million of malad project relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress 
the relicensing costs are recorded and held in construction work in progress until a new multi year license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the rate making process 
hells canyon complex the most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hells canyon complex  which provides approximately two thirds of ipc s hydroelectric generating capacity and percent of its total generating capacity 
ipc developed the license application for the hells canyon complex through a collaborative process involving representatives of state and federal agencies and business  environmental  tribal  customer  local government and local landowner interests 
the license application was filed in july and accepted by the ferc for filing in december of the current license for the hells canyon complex expires in july ipc will thereafter operate the project under an annual license issued by the ferc until the new multi year license is issued 
the application includes the continuation of existing  as well as proposed new measures intended to protect  mitigate and enhance fish and wildlife  protect recreational opportunities and preserve other aspects of environmental quality 
the costs of these pm e measures  as estimated in the license application  are approximately million in the first five years of a license and million over the following years  for a total estimated cost of million over a year license 
these cost estimates do not include estimated costs of proposed water quality measures included in the license application 
these measures are the subject of ongoing state processes under section of the clean water act 
ipc estimates that costs associated with these water quality measures may result in an additional cost of million  for a total estimated cost of million 
these estimated costs could increase as a result of the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process see discussion below 
in response to the filing of the license application in july  various federal and state agencies  native american indian tribes and other participants in the hells canyon complex relicensing process filed initial comments to the license application  some of which contained additional proposed pm e measures 
ipc s preliminary estimate of the potential cost of these additional proposed measures  assuming all of the proposed measures are included as conditions in a final license  which ipc believes is unlikely  is approximately billion over up to a year period 
this would result in an approximate percent increase to existing base rates 
these cost estimates are preliminary as federal  state  tribal and private parties participating in the relicensing proceeding are not required to file their final comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions with the ferc until later in the relicensing process 
the ferc will then consider these final comments  recommendations  terms  conditions and prescriptions under the federal power act  nepa and other applicable federal laws  and include those conditions in the final license that the ferc determines are necessary and required to protect  mitigate and enhance those resources affected by the operation and management of the project 
as such  the actual costs of the pm e measures associated with the relicensing of the hells canyon complex will not be known until the new license is issued by the ferc 
at december   million of hells canyon complex relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress 
the relicensing costs are recorded and held in construction work in progress until a new multi year license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to a new license  as discussed above  will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the rate making process 
nepa process nepa requires that the ferc independently evaluate the environmental effects of relicensing the hells canyon complex as proposed under the final license application the proposed action and also consider reasonable alternatives to the proposed action 
consistent with the requirements of nepa  the ferc staff will prepare an environmental impact statement for the hells canyon project  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the environmental impact statement will describe and evaluate the probable effects  if any  of the proposed action and the other alternatives considered 
as part of the nepa process  the ferc initiated a scoping process to support preparation of the environmental impact statement and help ensure that all pertinent issues are identified and analyzed 
on october   the ferc issued scoping document to provide interested parties with information on the relicensing of the project and solicit comments and suggestions for a preliminary list of issues and alternatives that might be addressed in the environmental impact statement 
the ferc also held four scoping meetings in the fall and winter of to offer parties the opportunity for input on the scope of the environmental impact statement 
based upon comments and information received in response to scoping document  on november   the ferc staff issued scoping document  which provides a tentative schedule for the environmental impact statement preparation including the filing of additional information on february   issuance of the ready for environmental analysis notice in february  and issuance of the draft environmental impact statement in september scoping document notes  however  that the dates for issuance of the ready for environmental analysis notice and draft environmental impact statement may change as necessary to allow the ferc to consider additional information needed to process the license application 
ipc and a number of other parties participating in the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process see consultation settlement process discussion below have requested that the ferc revise the schedule to enable the parties to pursue a comprehensive settlement agreement for the relicensing of the hells canyon complex 
ipc is working with the other parties to reach an agreement in principle on the relicensing issues by september  which will inform and focus the ferc in its preparation of the draft environmental impact statement for the nepa and relicensing process 
by order issued on february   the ferc granted ipc s request for a deferral and extended the due date for filing recommendations and conditions until november the ready for environmental analysis notice is now scheduled for may and the draft environmental impact statement is scheduled to be issued in april consultation settlement process in an effort to resolve issues associated with the relicensing of the hells canyon complex  ipc has been engaged with the ferc and relevant federal and state agencies on the effects  if any  of the relicensing of the project on species listed as threatened or endangered under the esa 
the national marine fisheries service listed snake river sockeye as endangered in  snake river spring  summer and fall chinook as threatened in and snake river steelhead as threatened in in june  the us fish and wildlife service also listed bull trout in the columbia and klamath river basins as threatened 
since ipc has been engaged in informal discussions with the national marine fisheries service and other federal  state and tribal interests on issues associated with the effect of the hells canyon complex operations on esa listed species and aquatic resources below the hells canyon complex in the context of the snake river basin adjudication mediation 
with respect to the informal consultations regarding relicensing of the hells canyon complex initiated in the snake river basin adjudication mediation  the ferc has designated ipc as its non federal representative for purposes of continuing this informal consultation with the national marine fisheries service and the us fish and wildlife service 
in july  the ferc requested formal consultation with the national marine fisheries service regarding the effects of interim hells canyon complex operations on esa listed species and issued a notice to all interested parties of an esa consultation meeting on september  to discuss how to proceed with consultation  including how to integrate the ongoing hells canyon complex relicensing settlement discussion into the consultation process 
on september   ipc submitted a letter to the ferc regarding the september  consultation meeting  advising that ipc  the national marine fisheries service and the us fish and wildlife service had explored opportunities to address esa issues associated with the interim operations and the relicensing of the hells canyon complex through a negotiated settlement process 
at the september  meeting  ipc  the national marine fisheries service and the us fish and wildlife service discussed the proposed settlement process with the ferc staff and other interested parties in attendance 
at the conclusion of that meeting  the parties  with the concurrence of the ferc staff  expressed an interest in engaging in additional discussions intended to reach agreement on an organizational structure for implementing the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process 
in late september  ipc  the national marine fisheries service  the us fish and wildlife service and other parties  including the states of idaho and oregon  the us forest service  several native american indian tribes  american rivers and idaho rivers united  interested in the relicensing of the hells canyon complex met to continue discussions relative to the initiation of the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process 
as a result of that meeting  the parties established a hells canyon complex settlement process in the fall of  which includes a settlement working group  a facilitator and separated ferc staff 
the initial objective of the settlement working group was to address interim operations and anadromous fish species listed under the esa in an effort to provide agreed upon measures to the ferc by april the primary objective of the settlement working group  however  is to negotiate and develop a comprehensive settlement agreement to support the relicensing of the project  with a goal of achieving an agreement in principle by september parties participating in the settlement working group include ipc  the national marine fisheries service  the us fish and wildlife service  the us bureau of land management  the us bureau of reclamation  the us department of agriculture forest service  the state of oregon  the state of idaho  the nez perce tribe  the shoshone paiute tribes  the shoshone bannock tribes  the burns paiute tribe  american rivers  idaho rivers united  the idaho water users association  the payette river water users association  the pioneer  settlers and nampa meridian irrigation districts  the committee of nine  the idaho farm bureau  the columbia river inter tribal fish commission  the idaho council on industry and the environment  the j 
r 
simplot company and other industrial customers of ipc 
following expedited negotiations  on january   ipc filed an agreement on interim operations interim agreement with the ferc 
the interim agreement has been executed by ipc  american rivers  idaho rivers united  the national marine fisheries service  the us fish and wildlife service  the us department of agriculture forest service  the us bureau of land management  the oregon departments of fish and wildlife and environmental quality  the nez perce tribe  the shoshone bannock tribes and the shoshone paiute tribes 
the interim agreement is intended to address issues relating to operations of the hells canyon complex and esa listed species in advance of the issuance of a new license while the parties to the settlement process negotiate a comprehensive settlement agreement 
in accordance with the provisions of the interim agreement  ipc has agreed to implement certain measures until a new license is issued for the hells canyon complex including monitoring flows above the hells canyon complex to protect existing rights  the leasing and passing of certain us bureau of reclamation flow augmentation water  continuing its fall chinook plan from march through may of each year  identifying and monitoring potential stranding sites and continuing to fund its hatchery program 
ipc has also agreed to implement certain additional measures on an annual basis  provided that the parties remain engaged in settlement discussions intended to resolve long term relicensing issues including  subject to certain variables  flow augmentation to aid anadromous fish migration  the shaping of us bureau of reclamation storage water  establishing procedures to collect the data and information necessary in the relicensing settlement discussions  identifying  developing and reviewing potential structural modifications regarding dissolved oxygen  total dissolved gas and seasonal water temperatures  providing water quality information to support consultations under section of the clean water act and sharing information regarding native resident and anadromous fish passage through the hells canyon complex 
the signatories agree that the measures in the interim agreement are intended to provide reasonable protection for esa listed species during the term of the interim agreement and also establish a basis for comprehensive settlement discussions to continue 
the settlement working group  with the continuing assistance of the facilitator and separated ferc staff commenced negotiations on the long term settlement agreement in january due to the number and complexity of the issues  it is anticipated that the parties to the settlement process will be required to devote substantial resources and time to the settlement effort in order to achieve the objective of reaching agreement by the fall of additional information requests the relicensing process permits interveners to submit additional study requests to the ferc 
in the hells canyon complex relicensing process  additional study requests were submitted in response to the ferc s notice of tendering application issued on july  the ferc received a total of additional study requests 
on may   the ferc staff responded to the additional study requests issuing to ipc a total of additional information requests 
on june   ipc filed a letter with the ferc objecting to certain of the additional information requests and requesting clarification  modification or extensions of time as to others 
ipc objected to some of the additional information requests on the basis that there was no nexus between the hells canyon complex operations and the asserted effects on the resources that were the subject of the additional information requests  submitting that under the federal power act  the ferc s authority to impose terms and conditions in a project license is limited to resources that are affected by the development  operation and management of the project 
in the case of several of the additional information requests  ipc contended that the resources at issue were affected by the development and operation of federal hydroelectric projects downstream from the hells canyon complex  not by the hells canyon complex 
ipc objected to other additional information requests relating to various limitations on flow  ramping rates and other operational restrictions intended to benefit recreational navigation below the hells canyon complex on the basis that the hells canyon national recreation area act hcnraa  enacted by congress in  grandfathers the hells canyon complex and prohibits flow requirements of any kind on waters of the snake river below the hells canyon complex 
on june   the ferc staff denied ipc s objections to the additional information requests  advising that their review of the license application indicates that the hells canyon complex has the potential to affect downstream resources and disagreeing that the hcnraa places any restriction on requirements that can be included in the license for the hells canyon complex 
the ferc staff also granted extensions of time and provided clarification for certain other additional information requests 
on july   ipc filed a petition for rehearing with the ferc contesting the ferc staff s decision denying ipc s objections to the additional information requests 
by letter dated july   ipc requested additional time to complete certain of the additional information requests because relevant studies and model runs could not be completed within the time allowed  and advised the ferc that although ipc had filed a request for rehearing regarding the ferc staff s denial of ipc s objections  ipc was proceeding with the studies and analysis relevant to the additional information requests pending the ferc s consideration of that request 
on september   ipc filed a request with the ferc requesting that it defer taking action on the pending rehearing request because ipc and other interested parties had commenced the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process discussed above 
ipc did not request  however  that the ferc defer action on the july  request for additional time 
by letter dated october   the ferc staff denied some of the requests for additional time and provided limited relief as to others 
on june   american rivers and idaho rivers united filed an interlocutory appeal of the ferc staff s denial of fish passage study requests  one of the additional study requests that the ferc staff did not adopt in its may  response 
ipc filed a response to the interlocutory appeal on june  by order dated july   the ferc dismissed the interlocutory appeal filed by american rivers and idaho rivers united 
swan falls project the license for the swan falls hydroelectric project expires in ipc is preparing for the first stage of formal consultation for the new license application  which will be filed with the ferc in at december   million of swan falls project relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress 
the relicensing costs are recorded and held in construction work in progress until a new multi year license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to a new license will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the rate making process 
american rivers petition on may   american rivers and idaho rivers united petitioned the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit requesting that the court issue a writ of mandamus compelling the ferc to respond to a petition american rivers filed with the ferc in requesting that the ferc initiate formal consultation pursuant to section a of the esa with the national marine fisheries service on the effects of the ongoing operations of ipc s hells canyon complex on four species of snake river salmon and steelhead trout that are listed as threatened or endangered under the esa 
the case was argued on march  on june   the court issued a decision in the case ordering the ferc to issue a judicially reviewable response to the petition within days 
on august   the ferc entered an order on mandamus and granting petition granting the petition 
consistent with this order  the ferc initiated esa consultation  setting a meeting on september  with the national marine fisheries service  the us fish and wildlife service and ipc to discuss the interaction of formal consultation on ongoing operations with the anticipated esa consultation regarding the relicensing of the hells canyon complex  and how any potential settlement discussions could be integrated into the consultation process 
the filing of the interim agreement with the ferc on january  resolved the issues raised by the court s order on mandamus and the ferc s order of august  while the parties to the hells canyon esa consultation settlement process negotiate a long term comprehensive agreement for relicensing

regional transmission organizations in december  the ferc  in order no 
 said that all companies with transmission assets must file with the ferc to form rtos or explain why they cannot do so 
order no 
is a follow up to order nos 
and issued in  which required transmission owners to provide non discriminatory transmission service to third parties 
by encouraging the formation of rtos  the ferc sought to further facilitate the formation of efficient  competitive wholesale electricity markets 
in july  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on standard market design 
in this notice  the ferc proposed significant wholesale electricity market design changes in an effort to advance the kinds of markets envisioned in order nos 
and but not yet realized 
the proposed changes were intended to improve wholesale competition  make more efficient use of transmission systems and generate clear pricing signals for investment in transmission  generation facilities and demand reduction 
in april  the ferc issued its white paper wholesale market platform 
the white paper set forth the ferc s then current thinking on issues under consideration in the standard market design proceeding 
the ferc committed to consider all comments on the white paper  as well as pending legislation  prior to the issuance of a final rule 
to date  the ferc has not issued a final rule in its standard market design proceeding 
in october and march  in response to ferc order no 
 ipc and nine other regional transmission owners filed stage one and stage two plans to form rto west  an independent entity that would operate the transmission grid in the northwest and british columbia 
in september  the ferc issued an order granting in part rto west s stage two request for a declaratory order  approving the majority of the proposed plan 
with further development of detail and some modification  the ferc stated that the proposal will satisfy not only the order no 
requirements  but that it can also provide a basic framework for standard market design for the west 
in mid  the rto west regional representatives group  in an effort to bolster regional support  began a new phase of discussions related to the development of an independent entity to manage the regional transmission system and improve related wholesale electricity markets 
these discussions began with a wide ranging consideration of current transmission problems and opportunities within the region 
during the remainder of  the regional representatives group focused on exploring options and developing a consensus proposal to address the region s transmission problems and opportunities 
as a result of this effort  the regional representatives group endorsed a comprehensive regional proposal in february the regional proposal provided a framework to better manage the regional transmission system and enhance wholesale power markets through the creation of an independent entity to manage the region s combined transmission services  operate certain aspects of the combined system such as transmission reservation and scheduling  provide monitoring of regional power markets  perform comprehensive transmission system wide planning and facilitate other aspects of transmission system operation 
in the spring of  the regional representatives group recommended that the name of rto west be changed to grid west and set out a plan to guide its creation 
the plan contained the following four steps to establish governance acceptable to the region and form the initial developmental corporation under an interim board comprised of participating entity representatives  participating entities commit to two years of funding and transfer control to a newly seated board comprised of members independent of any market participants  the independent board will develop and offer transmission control agreements under which grid west will perform certain operating functions on the transmission systems of participating entities  and to develop tariffs for new transmission services and grid west will reorganize from the developmental corporation into an operating corporation and will commence actual transmission operation 
the fourth step will be taken if sufficient entities sign transmission agreements 
in december  the filing entities of rto west voted unanimously to adopt the new bylaws and articles of incorporation to formally reorganize into the new entity  grid west developmental corporation 
this completed the first of the four major steps toward bringing grid west into operation 
the participating entities included avista corporation  the bonneville power administration  ipc  nevada power company  northwestern energy  pacificorp  portland general electric company  puget sound energy  sierra pacific power company and british columbia transmission corporation 
the first step establishes the grid west interim board  initiates a search for candidates to be elected as independent trustees on a new five person independent board and opens a process for interested parties to become members of the new organization 
the next step will transfer control to the new independent board 
the present schedule calls for reaching the second step in the fall of the third step is expected in and the fourth in the operational impact of grid west on ipc presently and for the near future should be minimal 
no ipc facilities will be subject to grid west operation until after operational authority is granted 
ipc will have periodic opportunities to decide whether or not to continue participation 
at the final step  signing a transmission agreement will be voluntary for ipc 
ipc has spent funds supporting the development of rto west and grid west  and expects to continue funding this development as long as it remains a participating utility 
funding of this effort has taken two forms 
first  funds have been loaned to rto west  and subsequently grid west  for the purpose of meeting its developmental expenses 
ipc expects this loan to be repaid by grid west when it commences operation 
second  ipc has incurred incremental internal costs from participating in the developmental effort  which are mostly related to travel and legal consultation 
ipc has accumulated these costs in deferred expense accounts 
the total accumulated expense for both types of funding through was million and is expected to be approximately million for at this time ipc expects full recovery of the total accumulated expense through rates 
ferc market based rate authority ipc has ferc approved market based rate authority  which permits ipc to sell electric energy at market based rates rather than cost based rates 
the ferc requires periodic reviews of the conditions under which this market based rate authority is granted to ensure that the rates charged thereunder are just and reasonable 
on april   the ferc issued an order commencing a market power analysis of all companies with market based rate authority  including ipc 
in september  ipc filed a revision of its previously approved october  market power analysis  which it supplemented in september and october 
on march   the ferc issued an order accepting ipc s market power analysis 
ipc is required to file another market power analysis on or before march  other matters adopted accounting pronouncement in january  idacorp and ipc adopted fin r  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies  which have one or more of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including the equity holders  the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a 
the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b 
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  c 
the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  and the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
idacorp and ipc evaluated their investments  contracts and other potential variable interests that would be subject to the provisions of fin r  and idacorp determined that it must consolidate two entities under those provisions 
at adoption  total assets and liabilities each increased by million and consisted primarily of property and long term debt 
cash flows of the newly consolidated entities are included on idacorp s consolidated statement of cash flows from the date of adoption 
net income was not affected by the adoption of the interpretation 
new accounting pronouncements sfas in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for certain inventory related costs 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   and is not expected to have a material effect on idacorp s or ipc s financial statements 
sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which amends existing guidance on accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas is effective for exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   and is not expected to have a material effect on idacorp s or ipc s financial statements 
sfas r in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payments 
sfas r which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
under the provisions of sfas r  the fair value of all stock options must be reported as an expense on the financial statements 
idacorp and ipc currently apply the measurement provisions of apb and the disclosure only provisions of sfas sfas r also changes other measurement  timing and disclosure rules relating to share based payments 
sfas r is effective for most public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  idacorp and ipc expect to adopt sfas r on july   and adoption is expected to decrease idacorp s and ipc s pre tax income by approximately million in stock based compensation arrangements are discussed in note to idacorp s consolidated financial statements 
fsp fas see note to idacorp s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this fsp  which relates to postretirement benefit obligations 
transmission reliability management system on april   the us department of energy issued its final report regarding the august  electric blackout in the eastern united states 
the western electricity coordinating council  of which ipc is a member  has treated the recommendations as though the outage occurred in the western interconnection 
the recommendations were assigned to various committees in the western electricity coordinating council to create policies and procedures to ensure compliance 
ipc is actively participating in many of these forums on a regional and national basis and is closely following the progress in other areas of the country 
following the western blackout  the western electricity coordinating council then the western systems coordinating council adopted the reliability management system  which created mandatory compliance and financial penalties for non compliance of the reliability criteria 
the north american electric reliability council is using the western electricity coordinating council reliability management system program as the model for their new mandatory compliance program 
the ferc has also demonstrated a great interest in ensuring compliance with the reliability standards 
in  the ferc required all electric utilities  including ipc  to submit a report on vegetation management practices 
ipc submitted this report in june this year  the ferc is requiring electric utilities to complete a survey on training practices 
ipc is currently in the process of submitting the training survey 
implementation of the blackout report recommendations and other ferc and north american electric reliability council policies could increase operating costs  but the extent of this effect cannot be determined at this time 
stage three power emergency on june   two downed transmission lines in the hells canyon area caused ipc to shed mw of electrical load and declare a stage three power emergency 
the stage three power emergency lasted approximately minutes and ipc employed all of its available generation resources during this time and purchased power from the wholesale markets 
ipc shed mw for the entire minutes and an additional mw for of the minutes 
this occurrence did not have a significant impact on ipc s financial results 
inflation idacorp and ipc believe that inflation has caused and will continue to cause increases in certain operating expenses and the replacement of assets at higher costs 
inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance costs and capital improvements 
while inflation has not had a significant impact on idacorp s or ipc s operations  costs for products and services are subject to increases 
ipc is subject to rate of return regulation and the impact of inflation on the level of cost recovery under regulation 
increases in utility costs and expenses due to inflation could have an adverse effect on earnings because of the need to obtain regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and ipc manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity though a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highlyrated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had million and million  respectively  in floating rate debt  net of temporary investments 
assuming no change in either company s financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher than the average rate on december   interest rate expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for both idacorp and ipc 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had outstanding fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively 
the fair market value of this debt was million and million  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate  and therefore do not expose idacorp or ipc to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk utility ipc s exposure to changes in commodity price is related to its ongoing utility operations producing electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and price of production 
the objective of ipc s energy purchase and sale activity is to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses which may develop 
ipc s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the previously discussed pca mechanism 
ipc has adopted a risk management program designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
this program has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc 
ipc s energy risk management policy the policy describes a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of ipc officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating status of risk management activities to the idacorp board of directors  and to the cag 
the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total dollar net power supply cost exposure for the current pca year plus the following pca year six months in advance of its commencement 
the rmc evaluates revised projections for the operating plan and orders risk mitigating action dictated by the limits stated in the policy 
ipc representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be ratified at this time for referral to the board of directors 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation 
energy trading the sale of ie s forward book of electricity trading contracts to sempra energy trading and the settlement of all gas trading contracts has eliminated the energy commodity price risk 
credit risk utility ipc is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy or complete financial settlement for market activities 
ipc mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
energy as part of the sale of the forward book of electricity trading contracts  ie entered into an indemnity agreement with sempra energy trading  guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
the indemnity agreement has been accounted for in accordance with fin and did not have a significant effect on idacorp s financial statements 
equity price risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of ipc and other equity investments at ipc 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
