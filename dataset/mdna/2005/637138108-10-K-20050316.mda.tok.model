table of contents market area national penn is headquartered in boyertown  berks county  pennsylvania 
boyertown is located in eastern berks county  which strategically positions national penn between philadelphia to the southeast  allentown and bethlehem to the northeast  and reading to the west 
we serve communities throughout southeastern pennsylvania 
specifically  we have a nine county market area in pennsylvania berks  bucks  chester  delaware  lancaster  lehigh  montgomery  northampton and philadelphia  as well as the cecil county  md area 
within this geographic region  there are four distinct market areas the reading berks county area  an area in which the service industry is increasingly replacing the old line manufacturing industry  the allentown lehigh valley area  consisting of lehigh and northampton counties  also an area in which a growing service industry is replacing the old line manufacturing industry  the five county philadelphia metropolitan area  consisting of philadelphia and its suburbs in bucks  chester  delaware and montgomery counties  and lancaster county  an area with a significant agricultural economy 
national penn s largest presence is in the reading berks county area  where of our community offices are located 
competition the banking and financial services industry is extremely competitive in our market area 
we face vigorous competition for customers  loans and deposits from many companies  including commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  credit unions  trust companies  mortgage companies  money market mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment firms 
many of these competitors are significantly larger than national penn  have greater resources  lending limits and larger branch systems  offer a wider array of banking services than national penn  and are long established in their geographic markets some of which have only been recently entered by national penn 
see general development of business below 
in addition  some of these competitors are subject to a lesser degree of regulation than that imposed on national penn 

table of contents many of these competitors have elected to become financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act of  including many of the largest ones 
this development will likely further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
see gramm leach bliley act below 
business strategy our goal is to become the most highly regarded financial institution in the markets we serve 
we intend to accomplish this goal by combining the sophisticated products and fee based services of a major regional bank with the personal attention  service and responsiveness of a community bank 
we believe this strategy results in greater profitability than a typical community bank 
the primary components of our business strategy are commercial banking  consumer banking  niche marketing  development of fee income  and enhanced customer service 
commercial banking 
commercial banking has been our historic and ongoing business focus 
our business customers tend to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between million and million who generally do not receive the attention of our larger  more nationally focused competitors 
many of these customers require us to have a high degree of understanding of their business in order for us to be able to customize solutions to their financial requirements 
we believe that this helps to distinguish us from our competitors 
we offer a wide range of products including short term loans for seasonal and working capital purposes  term loans secured by real estate and other assets  loans for construction and expansion needs  revolving credit plans and other commercial loans 
as of december   our commercial loan portfolio was billion  which represents of our total loans outstanding 
another important component of our commercial lending practice is our emphasis on small businesses and their unique needs 
in order to serve small businesses better  national penn bank was named an sba preferred express lender by the us small business administration 
being a preferred express lender authorizes us to underwrite and approve qualifying small business loans without the prior approval of the small business administration 
during  national penn bank originated over million of loans that qualified for us small business administration guarantees 
consumer banking 
we offer a full range of deposit accounts  which include demand  now  money market  certificates of deposit and other checking and savings accounts 
we also offer consumer loan products such as installment loans  home equity loans  residential mortgage loans  multi family loans  educational loans and credit cards 
in addition  we offer automated teller services through an inter bank automated teller system  safe deposit and night depository facilities and internet banking services  including on line bill paying 
niche marketing 
an important component of our business strategy is the development of business lines that give us higher margin opportunities 
we are continually assessing the markets within which we operate in order to identify and seize upon opportunities where we believe a market segment is being under served 
once identified  we focus on customizing solutions that are beneficial to the user and profitable to us 
an example is our manufacturing group 
the manufacturing group is a unique lending group whose focus is on assisting manufacturing firms in solving industry specific challenges 
the manufacturing group is comprised of specialized teams of experienced bankers who have industry specific training or experience and can offer an array of resources to time challenged business owners  through the manufacturing group s solutions network tm a database of national penn professionals and other selected third party resource providers who assist with financial and non financial business challenges 
value added areas include industry specific seminars  newsletters  websites and a board of advisors that provides feedback and support to the group 
at december   the manufacturing group managed relationships with loans outstanding of approximately million 
another example is our international banking group 
the international banking group provides for customer import  export and general documentary credit  foreign exchange and international payment needs 
as of december  the unit served over customers with a letter of credit portfolio totaling million 
the international banking group has been in operation since june 
table of contents a third example is our government banking group  formed in  which serves the unique banking needs of local government entities such as school districts  municipalities and townships 
at december   our government banking group deposits totaled million 
development of fee income 
we have formed a number of specialized investment  insurance and lending subsidiaries to develop fee income and to serve specific markets 
we provide trust and investment management services through investors trust company  our trust company subsidiary 
we also provide investment management services through firstservice capital  inc in total  investors trust company and firstservice capital manage approximately billion for over  individual and corporate customers 
we are in the process of consolidating the businesses of investors trust company and firstservice capital into a single entity to be named national penn investors trust company 
we provide insurance services through national penn insurance agency  inc national penn insurance agency generated over million in revenue in  acquired three insurance agencies since june  and now serves over  customers 
we conduct mortgage banking activities through national penn mortgage company 
we have provided securities brokerage services through a third party vendor since december prior to december  we provided securities brokerage services through a registered broker dealer subsidiary 
for the year ended december   our efforts produced total fee income of million compared to million for the year ended december  enhanced customer service 
our business strategy is supported by a strong delivery system that places great emphasis on customer service 
we have segmented our market into divisions based primarily on geographic considerations 
each division is managed by a division president who reports to a designated executive officer 
this officer coordinates our sales and servicing efforts in order to effectively serve our current customers and gain new customers 
the purpose of this initiative is to better leverage our centralized marketing and servicing efforts  thereby increasing sales of the wide range of products and services that we offer 
we believe that this cross functional approach leads to more responsive service for our customers who  in turn  reward us with more of their total financial services needs

table of contents loan portfolio at december  and december   our portfolio was composed of the following loan types dollars in thousands december percentage of portfolio december percentage of portfolio commercial real estate commercial properties residential subdivision multifamily commercial business loans commercial term loans mortgages lines of credit leases consumer loans residential mortgages home equity loans home equity lines of credit other loans total loans commercial lending general a majority of national penn bank s loan assets are loans to business owners of many types 
national penn bank makes commercial loans for real estate development  equipment financing  account receivables and inventory financing and other purposes as required by the broad spectrum of borrowers 
commercial loans by their nature carry higher risk than loans to consumers 
the changes in commercial borrowers financial condition and cash flow plus the potential volatility in the value of collateral held makes commercial lending a higher risk form of lending 
consequently  a greater percentage of national penn bank s resources and the staff s time are devoted to monitoring this area of the portfolio 
national penn bank s credit policies determine advance rates against the different forms of collateral that can be pledged against commercial loans 
typically  loans will be limited to of real estate values  of new equipment  against eligible accounts receivable and or less against finished inventory or raw material 
individual loan advance rates may be higher or lower depending upon the financial strength of the borrower and or the term of the loan 
below are different loan types and descriptions offered to national penn bank s commercial loan customers

interest rates will be either floating or fixed for periods up to years 
many loans  although written with extended amortizations  will actually require balloon payments at   or years

interest rates are usually floating and are generally based on wall street journal prime rate  or the day london interbank offered rate libor

table of contents consumer lending general national penn bank provides loans to consumers to finance personal residences  automobiles  college tuition  home improvements and other personal needs 
through its subsidiary  penn st financial services  inc operating under the trade name national penn mortgage company  national penn bank originates first lien residential mortgages throughout southeastern pennsylvania  new jersey  maryland  virginia  north carolina and south carolina 
in  national penn mortgage company originated million in residential mortgages down from million in all of these residential mortgages are sold to secondary market investors or held within national penn bank s investment or loan portfolios 
at year end  the residential mortgages held in national penn bank s loan portfolio totaled million compared to million as of december  national penn bank also provides home equity loans  home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans through its network of community offices and private banking division 
the majority of national penn bank s consumer loans are secured by the borrower s residential real estate in either a first or second lien position 
national penn bank requires a loan to value ratio of not greater than on this portfolio with some exceptions based on the borrower s financial strength 
national penn bank originates all of its home equity loans and home equity lines of credit directly with its customers 
national penn bank does have a small indirect loan portfolio in which the transactions are initiated through a third party  generally an auto dealer or equipment vendor  and subsequently funded by national penn bank 
this indirect loan portfolio had total loans outstanding at december   of million 
investment policies and strategies the investment portfolio consists of two parts the national penn bank portfolio and the national penn investment company portfolio 
the bank portfolio totaled billion and million at december  and december   respectively 
the investment company portfolio was million at december  and million at december  at december   investors trust company had a small investment portfolio of million as a vehicle to invest its capital 
national penn bank s investment portfolio consists primarily of agency and municipal bonds 
the agency bonds include debentures as well as mortgage backed securities issued by gnma  fnma and fhlmc 
agency and municipal bonds carry low risk based capital requirements 
the primary purpose of the bank investment portfolio is to provide a secondary source of liquidity  and the secondary purpose is to provide a source of income 
with liquidity as the primary focus  we concentrate on buying high quality  highly marketable securities 
we also construct the portfolio to provide a steady cash flow stream 
virtually all of the bank s investment portfolio supports our funding pledging needs that is  we must pledge qualifying assets to secure deposits of municipalities and other governmental entities 
in addition to the factors discussed  we follow a strategy of shortening the duration of the bank portfolio when rates are low and lengthening the duration of the investment portfolio when rates are high 
with interest rates remaining historically low during but beginning to increase  we primarily concentrated our investment purchases to shorter duration securities 
however  we still have bonds in the investment portfolio that we purchased in the late s when rates were much higher 
at that time  we purchased bonds with final maturities as long as years 
whether we are buying shorter term securities during low rate cycles  or longer term securities during times of higher rates  we consider the impact of the investment portfolio in the company s overall interest rate risk position 
we therefore might adjust this strategy  due to our need to remain consistent with our interest rate risk corporate guidelines 
in  and  we pooled our own production of ten and fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans and converted the loans to fhlmc securities in order to transfer assets to the investment portfolio 
this is a more price efficient way to add mortgage backed securities to our portfolio as compared to purchasing mortgage backed securities in the secondary market 
these loans  when securitized  are more liquid and also support our deposit pledging needs 

table of contents the investment company s portfolio consists primarily of investments in other commercial banks 
these investments are in the form of common stock or trust preferred securities 
the primary purpose of this portfolio is to generate income  including both current income in the form of interest and dividends  as well as long term capital gains 
the common stock is readily marketable  but there is not an active secondary market in the trust preferred securities 
our strategy in the trust preferred portfolio is to invest in other banks where we can understand the financial performance and risks involved  while enjoying a higher return 
these investments require the same risk based capital as commercial loans  but the overall dollar amount of this portfolio  at million  is small so the impact on capital is not material 
operating segments national penn has one reportable segment  community banking consisting of national penn bank and its subsidiaries  and certain other non reportable segments  as described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
footnote includes segment information on revenue  assets and income  and is incorporated by reference in this item products and services with reputation risk national penn and its subsidiaries offer a diverse range of financial and banking products and services 
in the event one or more customers and or governmental agencies becomes dissatisfied or objects to any product or service offered by national penn or any of its subsidiaries  negative publicity with respect to any such product or service  whether legally justified or not  could have a negative impact on national penn s reputation 
the discontinuance of any product or service  whether or not any customer or governmental agency has challenged any such product or service  could have a negative impact on national penn s reputation 
future acquisitions our acquisition strategy consists of identifying financial service companies  including banks  insurance agencies and investment advisers  with business philosophies that are similar to ours  which operate in strong markets that are geographically compatible with our operations  and which can be acquired at an acceptable cost 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  we generally consider potential revenue enhancements and operating efficiencies  asset quality  interest rate risk  and management capabilities 
we currently have no formal commitments with respect to future acquisitions  although discussions with acquisition candidates take place frequently 
concentrations  seasonality we do not have any portion of our businesses dependent on a single or limited number of customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
no substantial portion of loans or investments are concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries  although a significant amount of loans are secured by real estate located in southeastern pennsylvania 
our businesses are not seasonal in nature 
environmental compliance our compliance with federal  state and local environmental protection laws had no material effect on capital expenditures  earnings or our competitive position in  and is not expected to have a material effect on such expenditures  earnings or competitive position in employees at december   national penn and its subsidiaries had  full and part time employees

capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices

gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley act of glba repealed various provisions of the glass steagall act to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks securities firms 
amended the bhca to permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in any type of financial activity 
permits subsidiaries of national banks now to engage in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for national banks themselves 
the result is that banking companies are generally able to offer a wider range of financial products and services and are more readily able to combine with other types of financial companies  such as securities and insurance companies 
glba created a new kind of bank holding company called a financial holding company an fhc that is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to financial activities and any activity that the federal reserve determines is complementary to financial activities and does not pose undue risks to the financial system 
a bank holding company qualifies to become an fhc if it files an election with the federal reserve and if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized  well managed  and cra rated satisfactory or better 
although national penn believes that it is eligible to do so  national penn has not elected to become a financial holding company 
national penn has  instead  continued to utilize the continuing authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries to expand its business products and services 

table of contents glba also authorizes national banks to create financial subsidiaries 
this is in addition to the present authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries 
a financial subsidiary is a direct subsidiary of a national bank that satisfies the same conditions as an fhc  plus certain other conditions  and is approved in advance by the occ 
a financial subsidiary can engage in most  but not all  of the newly authorized activities 
national penn bank has not created any financial subsidiaries 
in addition  glba includes significant provisions relating to the privacy of consumer and customer information 
these provisions apply to any company the business of which is engaging in activities permitted for an fhc  even if it is not itself an fhc 
thus  they apply to national penn 
glba requires a financial institution to adopt and disclose its privacy policy  give consumers and customers the right to opt out of disclosures to non affiliated third parties  not disclose any account information to non affiliated third party marketers and follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer and customer information 
although the long range effects of glba cannot be predicted  national penn believes glba will further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the earnings performance and financial condition of the company with a primary focus on an analysis of operating results 
current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s strategic plan provides for a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increased market penetration in selected geographic areas  and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business 
the acquisition of peoples first  inc and its subsidiary  the peoples bank of oxford  in the second quarter is a strategic initiative by the company in furtherance of its focused goals 
the acquisitions of firstservice bank and hometowne heritage bank in were similar strategic initiatives 
the current economic climate and interest rate environment present challenges for all financial institutions in achieving their business goals 
continued interest margin compression makes asset growth a priority

additional information concerning forward looking statements is contained in this report at item business under the caption forward looking statements  which information is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis 
in september  the company completed the cash sale of its subsidiary  panasia bank  na panasia 
all financial information in this management s discussion and analysis for   and is restated to exclude panasia 
the sale of panasia is presented as discontinued operations under sfas no 
this presentation is intended to aid comparison of current and prior year results with future results 
all actual shares or per share information is restated to reflect a five for four stock split of the company s common stock effective september  and a stock dividend paid on the company s common stock for september  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practice within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and the assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 

table of contents goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
in this testing  the company employs general industry practices in accordance with gaap 
a fair value is determined for each reporting unit using various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill as of june each year  and again at any quarter end if any material events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
through its annual analysis as of june   the company has not identified any impairment of its goodwill 
no events occurred during third or fourth quarter necessitating a re test of goodwill impairment 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
the company has not substantially changed any aspect of its overall approach in the application of the foregoing policies 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques utilized as compared to previous years

table of contents net loans and leases  including loans held for sale  increased to billion in  an increase of million or compared to december  during  the company gained million in net loans due to the addition of firstservice bank and million in net loans from the addition of hometowne heritage bank

investment portfolio the investment portfolio is primarily a secondary source of liquidity  but it also serves as a source of income 
as such  the investment portfolio consists of shorter term investments that provide current liquidity and longer term investments that provide higher income 
over the past three years  the company has worked to shorten the duration of the investment portfolio in response to lower interest rates and to help improve liquidity

net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million

the increase in interest expense on deposits is due primarily to the acquisition of peoples first  inc  whose interest bearing deposits totaled million at the date of acquisition 
the increase in interest expense on borrowings is a result of increased balances due in part to the issuance of million of trust preferred securities  as well as the peoples first  inc acquired securities sold under repurchase agreements and long term borrowings of million 
despite the current low rate environment  the cost of attracting and holding deposited funds is an ever increasing expense in the banking industry 
these increases are the real costs of deposit accumulation and retention  including fdic insurance costs  marketing and community office overhead expenses 
such costs are necessary for continued growth and to maintain and increase market share of available deposits reflecting continued compression of the company s interest margin 
the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increase related to higher outstanding balances and that due to the levels and volatility of interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate  and changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume 

table of contents for purposes of the following table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

net interest margin is net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
during  net interest margin was  compared to during and during a portion of the decline in the net interest margin from the margin is attributable to the issuance of million of trust preferred securities bearing an interest rate of over the three month london inter bank offered rate libor  or at december   issued for capital and liquidity purposes in conjunction with the acquisition of peoples first  inc  and to the exchange of million of overnight borrowings from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh for long term advances for purposes of managing interest rate risk 
both of these actions resulted in significantly higher funding costs 
the remainder of the margin decline is due to continued competitive pressures and general overall margin compression 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december  and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and lease losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was at year end and at year end net loan chargeoffs of million in were unusually low compared to historical company results  as a result of a high level of loan recoveries 
net loan chargeoffs of million in were typical compared to historical company results 
management continues to believe its loan loss allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the current portfolio 
a detailed analysis of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses for the five years ended december   is shown below dollars in thousands december  balance at beginning of year charge offs commercial and industrial loans and leases real estate loans construction and land development residential other loans to individuals total charge offs recoveries commercial and industrial real estate loans construction and land development residential other loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs provision charged to expense adjustments changes incident to mergers and absorptions  net balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period 
table of contents commercial and industrial loans  real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all or part of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
loans to individuals are charged off any time repayment is deemed highly unlikely or as soon as the loan becomes days delinquent 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses  which are inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve based on historical trends  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial and industrial loans  real estate development loans  and construction loans which have been identified by bank management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole or part is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding and commitments that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial loans  real estate development and construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes or any other factor  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances  if any  which are subject to a guarantee by a government agency 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information  which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believes that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
the level of non performing assets  including loans over days delinquent 
levels of allowance for specific classified assets 
a review of portfolio concentration of any type  either customer  industry loan type  collateral or risk grade 

table of contents after completing this analysis each quarter  the company was able to reduce its provision for loan and lease losses in  as compared to and  while maintaining the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans and leases 
the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans and leases that the company has outstanding

other income and expenses other income increased million or in compared to  as a result of increased service charges on deposit accounts of million  increased other service charges and fees  including cash management  of  and increased insurance commissions and fees of million

sales of investment securities in totaled million 
the increase in deposit fees was primarily due to an increase in the collection of fees on a large deposit base  resulting from the acquisitions of firstservice bank and hometowne heritage bank 
the increase in insurance commissions was due largely to the addition of firstservice insurance agency  inc which contributed million of insurance related revenue 
the company received income in of million related to a merger of a mutual insurance company which is the issuer of certain life insurance policies held by the company  which accounted for much of the increase in other service charges and fees

table of contents as previously disclosed on a form k dated february   national penn s financial results for fourth quarter included a special charge of million for losses attributable to a fraudulent loan and deposit scheme discovered by national penn in january after a thorough investigation  national penn determined that approximately million of bank funds were stolen through a sophisticated pyramid style fraud scheme involving identity theft in various loan accounts 
this occurred in the loan portfolio managed by one former employee 
the accounts were manipulated to avoid detection by ongoing internal bank audits and controls 
national penn is reviewing  and strengthening where necessary  its internal control and audit procedures for further information  see item a 
controls and procedures of this report 
national penn is vigorously pursuing all available avenues  including insurance and civil claims  to recover the losses from the fraud to the maximum extent possible 
other expenses increased million or in when compared to  as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million  a million prepayment fee paid to the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh in the refinancing of long term debt  and increased other operating expenses of million 
salaries  wages and benefits increased due to normal salary increases and the addition of employees from the acquisitions of firstservice bank and hometown heritage bank 
as well as a contractual severance payment in december the increase in other operating expenses is also partially associated witht the acquisition of first service  which included a community office network of seven offices 
additional marketing expenses were attributable to additional advertising campaigns

the company s effective tax rate is for  for  and for  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is due to the decrease in tax advantaged income as a percent of taxable income 
the effective tax rate is less than the current incremental rate due to the company s investments in tax advantaged municipal securities and bank owned life insurance

as of january   the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
sfas no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
for the testing completed as of june   the company had no impairment of goodwill 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings

table of contents liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
during  the company s liquidity was adequate to meet the needs of the company s customers 
in  the company s liquidity had improved as people removed money from the declining equity market 
at that time  many customers preferred the safety of fdic insured deposits compared to the uncertain equity market  despite historically low interest rates 
this allowed the company to grow its core deposit base and significantly reduce reliance on non core sources of funds 
as the economy and the equity markets continue to improve during  the company s main liquidity concern was that the company might suffer disintermediation back to the equity market 
the company has been preparing for this potential disintermediation by working to build its share of customers banking business on the theory that even if some funds move back to the equity market  the company will still retain a larger share than it had previously  growing its government banking unit  reviewing its deposit product offerings  establishing additional non core sources of funding  maintaining a more liquid investment portfolio  and continuing to develop its capability to securitize assets 
the company s acquisitions of peoples first  inc in and firstservice bank and hometowne heritage bank in did not  in any case  have an immediate material impact on the company s current liquidity 
all three of the acquired banks retained their original names and brand identification in their divisional titles 
accordingly  the company expects no material run off in deposits over the long term  and as a result  does not anticipate a negative material impact on the company s overall long term liquidity position 
funding affecting short term liquidity  including deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  and short term borrowings which increased million during long term borrowings increased million during 
table of contents the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  in thousands repricing periods within three months three months through one year one year through five years over five years assets interest bearing deposits at banks federal funds sold investment securities loans and leases other assets liabilities and equity non interest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowed funds subordinated debt other liabilities shareholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the expected prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the fourth calendar quarter of the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will reprice at contractual repricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for repricing based on historical deposit decay rate analyses  as well as historical moving averages of run off for the company s deposits in these categories 
while generally subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a portion of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based upon the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
specifically  of these deposits are considered repriceable within three months and are considered repriceable in the over five year category 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and short and long term borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would increase in a falling interest rate environment and would decrease in a rising interest rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval of within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 

table of contents gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows dollars in thousands mvpe change in interest rate amount change basis points basis points basis points flat rate basis points basis points basis points management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions are used  such as or basis point changes in interest rates  or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
if the company should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its mvpe subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such mismatch 
the company could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes
