item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general anadarko petroleum corporation s primary line of business is the exploration  development  production and marketing of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the company s major areas of operations are located in the united states  canada and algeria 
the company is also active in venezuela  qatar and several other countries 
the company s focus is on adding high margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas 
the primary factors that affect the company s results of operations include  among other things  commodity prices for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  production volumes  the company s ability to find additional oil and gas reserves  as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations 
refocused strategy anadarko announced a refocused strategy in june strategy execution included an asset realignment that resulted in the company completing over billion in pretax asset sales during through a series of unrelated transactions 
combined  these divestitures represented about of anadarko s year end proved reserves and about of oil and gas production 
the company used proceeds from asset sales to reduce debt  repurchase anadarko common stock under a billion program authorized by the company s board of directors and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options 
the strategy refocuses the company s efforts and capital on the areas where it has consistently produced its best results  institutionalizes a process to manage the company s assets differently  lowers the reinvestment required to maintain existing production levels  and strengthens anadarko s financial discipline and strategic flexibility 
the company s properties are separated into two broad categories and managed to serve different roles within the overall portfolio 
foundation assets are those with efficient reinvestment features to hold production flat or to grow production modestly  and that generally have low underlying decline rates over a long period of time 
today  these assets are primarily onshore north america and are expected to generate significant free cash that can be reinvested into growth areas 
growth platforms are expected to become increasingly global in nature and currently include the gulf of mexico deepwater  algeria and qatar 
growth platform assets are expected to deliver differentiated growth rates by targeting high potential  exploration focused investments or new ventures that may include acquisitions as entry vehicles 
properties sold under the refocused strategy during included about mmboe of proved reserves on the date of sale 
most of the properties divested were located in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  the western canadian sedimentary basin and the mid continent region of the united states 
under full cost accounting rules  gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
the dispositions did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  therefore  the proceeds from these transactions were recognized as an adjustment of capitalized costs in the respective country cost centers

daily sales volumes in algeria were up due to the expansion of production facilities and the timing of cargo liftings 
the company s daily sales volumes in were down compared to the decrease for was due to lower volumes from operations in canada  primarily related to the divestiture of heavy oil properties in late and from operations in algeria primarily due to the substantial completion of cost recovery  whereby anadarko was reimbursed for previous exploration spending with additional barrels of oil production 
these decreases were partially offset by higher volumes from operations in the united states  primarily due to higher oil production in the western states as a result of the acquisition of howell in late sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories 
anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility  which is likely to continue in the future

operating results proved reserves anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling  improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties 
mmboe proved reserves beginning of year reserve additions and revisions sales in place production end of year proved developed reserves beginning of year end of year the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end were billion barrels compared to billion barrels at year end and billion barrels at year end crude oil  condensate and ngls comprised about half of the company s proved reserves at year end  and 
table of contents the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
the available data reviewed include  among other things  seismic data  structure and isopach maps  well logs  production tests  material balance calculations  reservoir simulation models  reservoir pressures  individual well and field performance data  individual well and field projections  offset performance data  operating expenses  capital costs and product prices 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
reserve additions and revisions during  the company added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of additions extensions  discoveries  improved recovery and purchases in place which were partially offset by downward revisions 
additions during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of successful drilling in its core onshore north american properties and the deepwater gulf of mexico  successful improved recovery operations in wyoming and minor producing property acquisitions

in  the company added mmboe through successful drilling in its core north american properties  successful improved recovery operations in wyoming and producing property acquisitions 
the company expects the majority of future reserve additions to come from extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in north america and the deep waters of the gulf of mexico  as well as through improved recovery operations  purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future

revisions total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
performance revisions of mmboe were related to the company s reserves at marco polo and several other properties  partially offset by positive revisions in other areas 
price revisions of mmboe were due to the loss of royalty relief barrels from the gulf of mexico and the recalculation of equity barrels under a service fee contract in venezuela  mostly offset by positive price revisions in us onshore and algeria due to higher year end prices

during the year period  anadarko s annual reserve revisions  up or down  have been below for either type of revision 
the company believes this is an indicator of the validity of the company s processes for estimating reserves

proved undeveloped reserves to improve investor confidence and provide transparency regarding the company s reserves  anadarko reports the status of its proved undeveloped reserves puds annually 
the company annually reviews all puds  with a particular focus on those puds that have been booked for three or more years  to ensure that there is an appropriate plan for development 
generally  onshore united states puds are converted to proved developed reserves within two years 
certain projects  such as improved oil recovery  arctic development  deepwater development and many international programs  may take longer  sometimes beyond five years 
nearly of the company s puds booked prior to are in algeria and are being developed according to an algerian government approved plan

table of contents future net cash flows at december   the present value discounted at of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and billion  after income taxes stated in accordance with the regulations of the sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the after income taxes decrease of million or in compared to is primarily due to divestitures of properties  offset in part by additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling and development and higher natural gas and oil prices at year end see supplemental information under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
marketing strategies overview the company s marketing department actively manages sales of its natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
the company markets its production to customers at competitive prices  maximizing realized prices while managing credit exposure 
the market knowledge gained through the marketing effort is valuable to the corporate decision making process 
the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
therefore  even though the company sells significant volumes to major purchasers  the company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the company s natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls at comparable market prices 
the company also purchases natural gas  crude oil and ngls volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near anadarko s production 
these purchases allow the company to aggregate larger volumes and attract larger  creditworthy customers  which in turn enhance the value of the company s production 
the company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas  oil  condensate and ngls 
however  the company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities 
the company s trading risk position  typically  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
essentially all of the company s trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months 
see energy price risk under item a of this form k 
since  all segments of the energy market experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition  liquidity and credit 
this has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies 
anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third party purchasers  however  in certain situations the company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases 
natural gas natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of north america s energy needs and the company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue 
the tightening of the natural gas supply and demand fundamentals has resulted in extremely volatile natural gas prices  which is expected to continue 
anadarko markets its equity natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets 
anadarko energy services company  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko  is a marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing  risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs 
the company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
the company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s gas production was sold under long term contracts to duke energy corporation duke 
these sales represent  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the contracts that represented most of these volumes expired during the company integrated the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to duke into its 
table of contents current marketing operations and now sells it to various purchasers at market prices 
volumes sold to duke under the long term contracts were at market prices 
a company anadarko acquired in was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gathering  processing and marketing gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke 
most of these agreements were transferred to duke in the gpm disposition 
one agreement was retained  but is managed and operated by duke 
anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the company s natural gas 
as part of the gpm disposition  anadarko pays duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke pays anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
this keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contract s expiration date or february the company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to potential decreases in future transportation market values 
while derivatives are intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in the market value of firm transportation  they also limit the potential to benefit from increases in the market value of firm transportation 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the new york mercantile exchange nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices 
crude oil  condensate and ngls anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls revenues are derived from production in the us  canada  algeria and other international areas 
most of the company s us crude oil and ngls production is sold under day evergreen contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location  quality and transportation 
most of the company s canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater 
oil from algeria and other international areas is sold by tanker as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel 
the company also purchases and sells third party produced crude oil  condensate and ngls in the company s domestic and international market areas 
included in this strategy is the use of various derivative instruments 
gas gathering systems and processing anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested about million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
the vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
the company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction of ngls in efficient plants with flexible commitments 
anadarko also processes gas and has interests in two company operated plants 
anadarko s strategy to aggregate gas through company owned and third party gathering systems allows anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the company has significant production 
capital resources and liquidity overview anadarko s primary sources of cash during included cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of non core assets 
the company used these sources primarily to fund its capital spending program  reduce debt  repurchase anadarko common stock  increase cash and pay dividends to the stockholders 
the company funded its capital investment programs in primarily through cash flow and in primarily through cash flow plus increases in long term debt and proceeds from property sales 

table of contents cash flow from operating activities anadarko s cash flow from operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in cash flow is primarily attributed to higher commodity prices  partially offset by higher costs and expenses 
also  although the property divestitures resulted in no gain or loss recognition for financial reporting purposes  cash flow was reduced by about million of current income taxes associated with the divestiture program 
this increase in current tax expense was offset by a reduction in deferred tax expense 
the increase in cash flow compared to is attributed to the significant increase in commodity prices 
fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk 
sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past 
sales volume decreases associated with divestitures made during are expected to result in lower cash flow from operating activities 
anadarko s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations 
divestitures the company completed over billion in various pretax asset sales during income taxes paid in conjunction with these transactions were about million

exploration spending in will focus on a number of key areas in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
in addition  the company will explore for deep gas objectives onshore in the us and in canada 
international exploration will focus on drilling programs in algeria  qatar  tunisia and indonesia  as well as activities within other targeted new venture areas 
the company expects steady funding of the capital program regardless of oil and gas price volatility 
anadarko s refocused strategy is designed to enable a capital program that is self funding at mid cycle oil and gas prices 
when prices exceed mid cycle levels  as is currently the case  the excess cash would be systematically used to build additional balance sheet strength through debt reductions  returned to shareholders through stock repurchases  and otherwise be made available for reinvestment in other strategic options 
alternatively  when prices are below the company s mid cycle targets  anadarko could draw upon its strengthened debt capacity to fund a steady level of activity 
the company s capital spending noted above was determined at an investment level that is less than cash flow using recent nymex prices 
therefore  cash flow in is expected to be higher than capital spending 
the company intends to use a portion of year end cash balances and a portion of expected excess cash flow to repurchase common stock and pay down debt 
if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow  funds are supplemented as needed by short term borrowings under commercial paper  money market loans or credit agreement borrowings 
to facilitate such borrowings  the company has in place a million committed credit agreement  which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility 
it is the company s policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may file shelf registration statements in advance with the sec 
the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property sales and additional borrowings  to secure funds when needed 
at this time  anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  the executives and directors benefits trust  the exercise of stock options  the issuance of restricted stock or the company s employee savings plan and employee stock ownership plan equity funded contributions

operating leases during  anadarko and a group of energy companies atwater valley producers group executed agreements with a third party to design  construct  install and own independence hub  a semi submersible platform in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
the platform structure  expected to be mechanically complete in late  will be operated by anadarko 
first production from anadarko s discoveries to be processed on the facility is expected in the latter half of the agreements require a monthly demand charge of about million for five years beginning at the time of mechanical completion  a processing fee based upon production throughput and a transportation fee based upon pipeline throughput 
since the company s obligation related to the agreements begins at the time of mechanical completion  the table above does not include any amounts related to these agreements 
the agreements do not contain any purchase options  purchase obligations or value guarantees 
during  the company s two corporate office buildings located in the woodlands  texas  were acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of a major financial institution from the special purpose entities that had leased the buildings to the company 
the original leases were amended and restated  and  other than the extension of the period of the lease  the terms of the replacement lease between the company and the real estate development company were essentially unchanged 
the total amount funded under the new lease was approximately million 
the table above includes lease payment obligations related to this lease under operating leases 
in  the company entered into an agreement under which a floating production platform for its marco polo discovery in the deepwater gulf of mexico was installed in the agreement requires a monthly demand charge of slightly over million for five years and a processing fee based upon production throughput 
anadarko began making payments for the monthly demand charges during the table above includes the payment obligations related to the monthly demand charge for this agreement in operating leases

transportation and storage anadarko has entered into various transportation and storage agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas 
the above table includes transportation and storage commitments of million  comprised of million in the united states and million in canada 
oil and gas activities as is common in the oil and gas industry  anadarko has various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration  development and production activities 
the company has work related commitments for  among other things  drilling wells  obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments

table of contents marketing and trading contracts the following tables provide additional information regarding the company s marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative contracts and the firm transportation keep whole agreement and related financial derivative instruments as of december  see critical accounting policies and estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated 
firm marketing transportation and trading keep whole total millions fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  assets liabilities contracts realized or otherwise settled during fair value of new contracts when entered into during other changes in fair value fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  assets liabilities fair value of contracts as of december  maturity maturity less than maturity maturity in excess assets liabilities year years years of years total millions marketing and trading prices actively quoted prices based on models and other valuation methods firm transportation keep whole prices actively quoted prices based on models and other valuation methods total prices actively quoted prices based on models and other valuation methods both exchange and over the counter traded derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements 
margin deposits are required of the company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits 
given the company s hedge position and price volatility  the company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements 
during  the company s margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to million 
the company had margin deposits of million outstanding at december  other in  the company made contributions of million to its funded pension plans  million to its unfunded pension plans and million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans 
contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments 
in  the company expects to contribute about million to its funded pension plans  million to its unfunded pension plans and million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans 
future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions  market performance and individual year funding decisions 
the company is unable to accurately predict what contribution levels will be required beyond for the pension plans  however  they are expected to be at levels lower than those made in the company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to continue at slightly increasing levels above those made in during  proceeds from the sale of future royalty revenues were accounted for as deferred revenues and classified as liabilities on the balance sheet 
these deferred revenues will be amortized to other sales on a unit of revenue basis over the year term of the related agreement 
the third party relies solely on the royalty payments 
table of contents to recover their investment and  as such  has the risk of the royalties not being sufficient to recover their investment over the term of the agreement 
anadarko is also subject to various environmental remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal  state and local laws and regulations 
as of december   the company s balance sheet included a million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations  most of which were incurred by companies that anadarko has acquired 
the company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process  and believes the amount recorded is appropriate

critical accounting policies and estimates financial statements and use of estimates in preparing financial statements  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes  fair value and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
properties and equipment the company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the sec 
under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
in  the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization the depreciable base for oil and gas properties includes the sum of capitalized costs net of accumulated dd a  estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not accrued in oil and gas properties  less costs excluded from amortization and salvage 
the depreciable base of oil and gas properties and mineral investments are amortized using the unit of production method 
all other properties are stated at original cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the useful life of the assets  which ranges from three to years 
properties and equipment carrying values do not purport to represent replacement or market values 
proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation s x rule a i  ii  iii  and  are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits 
table of contents sooner 
a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the dd a rate calculation and the financial statements 
under the terms of anadarko s risk service contract with the national oil company of venezuela  anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices economic interest method 
this means that higher oil prices reduce the company s reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase reported production volumes and reserves 
production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the company s economic interest have no impact on the value of the project 
costs excluded oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
significant properties  primarily comprised of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks  alaska  the land grant and other international areas  are individually evaluated each quarter by the company s exploration and engineering staff 
nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of drilling individual wells 
the company has a to year exploration and evaluation program for the land grant acreage 
costs are transferred accordingly to the dd a pool over the length of the program 
the land grant s mineral interests both working and royalty interests are owned by the company in perpetuity 
all other significant properties are evaluated over a five to ten year period  depending on the lease term 
insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the united states and canada 
nonproducing leases are transferred to the dd a pool over a three to five year period based on the average lease term 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of evaluation 
capitalized interest sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  provides standards for the capitalization of interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets 
under fasb interpretation no 
applying fasb statement no 
to oil and gas producing operations accounted for by the full cost method  costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects  on which dd a expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress  qualify for capitalization of interest 
capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the company s weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs excluded 
capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense 
as costs excluded are transferred to the dd a pool  the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the dd a pool 
ceiling test companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges and excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment can give anadarko a significant loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced 
for cash flow hedge effect information  see supplemental information discounted future net cash flows under item of this form k 

table of contents derivative instruments the vast majority of the derivative instruments utilized by anadarko are in conjunction with its marketing and trading activities or to manage the price risk attributed to the company s expected oil and gas production 
anadarko also periodically uses derivatives to manage its exposure associated with the firm transportation keep whole agreement  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
all derivatives  other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception  are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
anadarko prefers to apply hedge accounting for derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with the company s oil and gas production  foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
however  some of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 
in these instances  unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in earnings 
for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting  anadarko formally documents the relationship of each hedge to the hedged item including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
each hedge is also assessed for effectiveness quarterly 
under hedge accounting  the derivatives may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values  cash flows or foreign currencies 
if the hedge relates to the exposure of fair value changes to a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative and the unrealized losses and gains on the hedged item are both recognized currently in earnings 
if the hedge relates to exposure of variability in the cash flow of a forecasted transaction  the effective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction is recorded 
the ineffective portion of unrealized gains and losses attributable to cash flow hedges  if any  is recognized currently in other income expense 
hedge ineffectiveness is that portion of the hedge s unrealized gains and losses that exceed the hedged item s unrealized losses and gains 
in those instances where it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings in the current period 
accounting for unrealized gains and losses attributable to foreign currency hedges that qualify for hedge accounting is dependent on whether the hedge is a fair value or a cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains and losses attributable to derivative instruments used in the company s marketing and trading activities including both physical delivery and financially settled purchase and sales contracts  the firm transportation keep whole agreement and derivatives used to manage the exposure of the keep whole agreement are recognized currently in earnings 
the marketing and trading unrealized gains and losses that are attributable to the company s production are recorded to gas sales and oil and condensate sales 
the marketing and trading unrealized gains and losses that are attributable to third party production are recorded to other sales 
the gains and losses attributable to the firm transportation keep whole agreement and associated derivatives are recorded to other income expense 
the company s derivative instruments are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data 
option valuations are based on the black scholes option pricing model and verified against third party quotations 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on an internally developed model that utilizes historical natural gas basis prices

due to the lack of clarification related to this provision of the jobs act  this fsp allows additional time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the impact of this provision as it relates to sfas no 
the emerging issues task force eitf is considering issues related to whether buy sell arrangements with the same counterparty for the same commodity should be accounted for at historical cost or fair value 
eitf issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  does not reach a consensus on these issues and further discussion is planned 
in addition  the sec has questioned the appropriateness of reporting the proceeds and costs of buy sell arrangements on a gross basis in the income statement 
anadarko accounts for buy sell arrangements related to its production on a net basis in the income statement 
if gross basis reporting were required  both revenues and costs and expenses would increase 
regulatory matters and additional factors affecting business forward looking statements the company has made in this report  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
these forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves  schedules  plans  timing of development  contributions from oil and gas properties  and those statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  projects  target  goal  plans  objective  should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k and in the company s other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management 
anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions and production quotas of opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
in addition  in opec countries in which anadarko has production such as algeria  venezuela and qatar  when the world oil market is weak  the company may be subject to periods of decreased production due to government mandated cutbacks 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail production and capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand for oil and gas in the us and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
under the full cost method of accounting  a noncash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low 
whether the company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter  as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter 
while this noncash charge can give anadarko a significant reported loss for the period  future expenses for dd a will be reduced 
environmental and safety the company s oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and 
table of contents regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
the board of directors and management of the company regularly review the risks facing anadarko s business  including the environmental and regulatory matters associated with the company s operations 
the company has formed a climate change committee committee composed of employees representing disciplines across the company to address greenhouse gas ghg issues 
the committee  through management  reports annually to the board of directors nominating and corporate governance committee as part of that committee s annual review of governance matters so that the board can play a direct role in assessing how the company is evaluating and responding to climate change issues and ghg emissions 
additionally  the company has adopted a ghg management plan  which addresses the management of emissions of coand methane on all of the company s worldwide operating locations  and provides for the ongoing collection of baseline ghg emissions data 
the company s plan describes specific actions that the company has taken and plans to take in order to meet the goals and objectives of these programs 
more information concerning the company s climate change initiatives  including the committee s charter and an executive summary of the ghg management plan  can be found on the company s website  www 
anadarko 
com  under the responsibility  environmental  health safety and global climate change links 
anadarko participates in voluntary ghg programs as a member of certain trade organizations both in the united states and canada 
through a canadian subsidiary  anadarko has since voluntarily submitted ghg data into the voluntary challenge and registry  inc program sponsored by the canadian government 
the company is a partner in the us environmental protection agency s natural gas star program and is participating in the american petroleum institute climate challenge program 
through these programs  the company is formulating a plan for the assessment of emission sources which will include determination of the protocol for measurement to develop an accurate baseline in the united states 
as part of its commitment to protecting the environment  anadarko is working with the us department of energy and the scientific community to study the long term storage of co in its enhanced oil recovery projects 
co is produced along with natural gas in certain fields and the co has historically been vented to the atmosphere 
however  through its co sequestration projects in wyoming and canada  reinjecting this co in the company s projects will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases introduced into the atmosphere 
anadarko expects to sequester about million tons of co over the lifetime of the salt creek and monell projects in wyoming 
the alpine field also serves as an excellent example of anadarko s commitment to minimizing the impact of exploration and production operations in environmentally sensitive and logistically challenging areas 
the production facilities for the alpine field are situated on about acres  less than one half of one percent of the subsurface reservoir area being developed 
in addition  alpine is a zero discharge facility  the waste generated is reused  recycled or disposed of properly 
anadarko is also committed to protecting the environment in its coalbed methane activities by reinjecting the majority of produced water and  where appropriate  proactively working with state and federal agencies to develop new water treatment and handling technologies for the beneficial use of produced coalbed water 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations 
wherever anadarko operates  its policy is to adhere to each individual country s applicable laws and regulations as well as anadarko s own environmental standards 
anadarko maintains this same level of compliance in countries that are signatories to the kyoto protocol 
neither anadarko nor any of the company s peers yet know the regulatory obligations that may be imposed with regard to ghg emissions 
at this time  attempts to assess impacts on stockholder value can only be speculative 
the company does not expect climate change to be a material strategic business issue for the next five to seven years  however  this assessment may change as anadarko continues to review the issues surrounding ghg emissions and climate change 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see legal proceedings under item of this form k 

table of contents exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not insured against all risks in all aspects of its business  such as political risk  business interruption risk and risk of major terrorist attacks  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is involved in several large development projects 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include major oil and gas companies  independent oil and gas companies  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
some of the company s competitors may have greater and more diverse resources upon which to draw than does anadarko 
if the company is not successful in its competition for oil and gas reserves or in its marketing of production  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
other regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells  regulate well spacing  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service of the us department of the interior 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
any significant increase in costs associated with regulatory compliance or restrictions imposed on the company s operations by regulation may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents legal proceedings general the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including  but not limited to  personal injury claims  royalty claims  contract claims and environmental claims 
while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company  although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved 
for a description of certain legal proceedings in which the company is involved  see legal proceedings under item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks are fluctuations in energy prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these fluctuations can affect revenues and the cost of operating  investing and financing activities 
the company s risk management policy provides for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of derivative instruments utilized by the company include futures  swaps  options and fixed price physical delivery contracts 
the volume of derivative instruments utilized by the company is governed by the risk management policy and can vary from year to year 
for information regarding the company s accounting policies related to derivatives and additional information related to the company s derivative instruments  see note summary of significant accounting policies and note financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
energy price risk the company s most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas  crude oil  ngls and the firm transportation keep whole agreement 
management expects energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
in addition  a noncash writedown of the company s oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if prices declined significantly  even if it is only for a short period of time 
see critical accounting policies and estimates ceiling test under item of this form k 
below is a sensitivity analysis of the company s commodity price related derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company had equity production hedges of bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil as of december  excluding physical delivery fixed price contracts 
as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million on these derivative instruments 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would result in an additional loss on these derivative instruments of approximately million 
however  this loss would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of that portion of the company s equity production that is hedged 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million losses of million and gains of million on derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes and a net unrealized gain of million gains of million and losses of million on derivative physical delivery contracts entered into for trading purposes 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a increase in underlying commodity prices  the potential additional loss on the derivative instruments would be approximately million 
firm transportation keep whole agreement a company anadarko acquired in was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke 
as part of the gpm disposition  anadarko pays duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke pays anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement
