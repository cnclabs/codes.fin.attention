executive overview the company provides services and equipment to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet that is ultimately dependent upon oil and natural gas prices that  in turn  are determined by the supply demand relationship for oil and natural gas 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
certain provisions of the american jobs creation act of the act  effective for the company as of april   afford the company the ability to omit recording deferred tax assets or liabilities on future undistributed earnings of most non us subsidiaries and business ventures that it considers indefinitely reinvested abroad 
the company currently believes this position will apply to earnings of these entities for the foreseeable future 
consistent with that belief  the company has  effective march   reversed all previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities related to timing differences  foreign tax credits  or prior undistributed earnings of these entities whose future and prior earnings are now anticipated to be indefinitely reinvested abroad 
the result of this reversal of previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities was approximately million and it was recorded as a reduction of income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to the april  effective date of the act  the company had provided income taxes at the us statutory rate on generally all profits of the company generated from both us and international operations 
effective april  income taxes on earnings generated in the us will be provided for at the us statutory income tax rate and the company earnings generated from international operations which we expect to be permanently invested abroad will be provided at the tax rates of the respective countries where the profits are generated 
generally  these international tax rates are significantly less than the us statutory income tax rate  therefore  the company s consolidated effective tax rate should be 
table of contents significantly lower post april  than what the company has historically experienced 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate in the future could be more volatile as a result of changing profit levels from the various countries in which the company operates 
fiscal domestic results of operations posted an operating profit for the first time since fiscal the company s domestic based operating profit increased million from the prior fiscal year despite earning approximately lower revenues during the current fiscal year due to lower domestic fleet operating costs as the domestic fleet size was reduced through vessel sales and the redeployment of vessels to international markets with better opportunities 
lower operating costs coupled with improved vessel utilization and average dayrates resulted in the increase in operating profits from the prior fiscal year 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for crude oil 
although the company s fiscal international revenues increased approximately as compared to fiscal  it experienced a slight decline in fiscal international based operating profit from fiscal levels reflecting an increase in vessel operating costs and depreciation expense as the number of vessels operating in the international markets increased 
fiscal witnessed the delivery of newly constructed vessels  which consisted of seven anchor handling towing supply vessels  four crewboats and one platform supply vessel 
the company also purchased three anchor handling towing supply vessels and one platform supply vessel during fiscal two of the newly constructed anchor handlers are deepwater class vessels 
the remaining newly built anchor handlers and platform supply vessels along with the four purchased supply vessels expanded the company s core vessel fleet 
to date  the company has funded all of its vessel commitment programs from current cash balances  operating cash flow  and funds provided by its million senior unsecured notes and its revolving credit facility 
vessel construction programs and acquisitions the company currently has under construction three large anchor handling towing supply vessels that are capable of working in most deepwater markets of the world 
a chinese shipyard is constructing the vessels and scheduled deliveries have been substantially delayed 
the shipbuilder has advised the company to expect  and the company expects  the three vessels to be delivered throughout the remainder of calendar year the total estimated cost for the vessels is approximately million  which includes shipyard commitments and other incidental costs such as spare parts  management and supervision  and outfitting costs 
the company has fixed cost contracts supported by performance bonds with the shipyard and does not anticipate any cost overruns related to these vessels 
as of march   million has been expended on the vessels 
the company is also constructing five anchor handling towing supply vessels varying in size from  brake horsepower bhp to  bhp 
two international shipyards are each constructing two vessels while a third international shipyard is constructing one vessel 
scheduled delivery for the five vessels will begin in may  with the last vessel scheduled for delivery in november as of march   million has been expended on the vessels of the total million commitment cost 
the company is committed to the construction of one foot  intermediate size supply vessel for approximately million 
the company s shipyard  quality shipyard  llc  is constructing the vessel 
although capable of working in certain deepwater markets  this vessel will replace older supply vessels 
scheduled delivery of the vessel is expected in january as of march   million has been expended on this vessel 
the company is also committed to the construction of one foot  state of the art  fast  crew supply boat and five water jet crewboats for an approximate total cost of million 
a us shipyard is constructing the foot crewboat  while a shipyard in holland is constructing the five water jet crew boats 
scheduled delivery of the foot crewboat is expected in may the five water jet crewboats are expected to be delivered between may and november as of march   million has been expended on the six crewboats

the majority of the company s supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and will need to be replaced within the next several years 
in addition to age  market conditions will also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows and borrowing capacities to fund over the next few years significant capital expenditures  primarily relating to the continuing replacement of the company s international anchor handling towing supply vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels 
the company believes that adequate capital resources will be available to maintain the existing fleet and continue its vessel building and acquisition program 
during fiscal  the company took delivery of two deepwater anchor handling towing supply vessels and five anchor handling towing supply vessels varying in size from  brake horsepower bhp to  bhp 
a shipyard in china constructed the two deepwater anchor handling towing supply vessels  with a bhp in excess of  for an approximate cost of million 
the first china built deepwater vessel was delivered during the second quarter of fiscal the second deepwater anchor handler was delivered in march and is currently being modified and outfitted by a second shipyard in preparation for a long term contract which will begin in august all five of the anchor handling towing supply vessels were built by international shipyards for an approximate total cost of million 
the company also took delivery of one platform supply vessels  three foot crewboats and one water jet crewboat during fiscal for an approximate total cost of million 
a us shipyard constructed the platform supply vessel while a different us shipyard built the three foot state of the art  fast  crew supply boats 
a shipyard in holland built the water jet crewboat 
the platform supply vessel was built in order to replace older supply vessels and is intermediate in size and technically capable of working in certain deepwater markets 
also during fiscal  the company purchased three  to  bhp anchor handling towing supply vessels for approximately million and one platform supply vessel for approximately million 
on april   the company paid million in cash to ensco international incorporated to purchase its vessel gulf of mexico based marine fleet 
the mix of vessels the company acquired consisted of five anchor handling towing supply vessels  six stretched foot platform supply vessels and supply vessels 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the vessels  it was agreed that  for a two year period and subject to satisfactory performance  the company would provide to ensco all of its discretionary vessel requirements in the gulf of mexico 
the day rates charged under the arrangement were based upon predetermined pricing criteria 
this original agreement expired on march   but a one year extension under similar terms has been agreed to 
the acquisition enhances the competitive posture of the company in providing anchor handling and towing supply services in the gulf of mexico 

table of contents during fiscal  the company took delivery of two large  platform supply vessels one constructed by a brazilian shipyard and the other by a shipyard in the far east 
the company also took delivery of nine next generation supply vessels  ranging in size from foot to foot  for approximately million 
the company s shipyard  quality shipyard  llc  constructed three of the next generation supply vessels and two other us shipyards constructed the remaining six vessels 
although the nine vessels are intermediate in size and are technically capable of working in certain deepwater markets they were constructed to replace older supply vessels 
also during fiscal  the company purchased two  bhp anchor handling towing supply vessel for approximately million  purchased one offshore tug for approximately million and took delivery of three water jet crewboats that were constructed in holland for approximately million 
during fiscal  the company took delivery of seven large platform supply vessels that were delivered to the market for an approximate total cost of million 
three of the platform supply vessels were constructed at quality shipyards  llc and were built to full jones act compliance 
a shipyard in singapore constructed two of the large platform supply vessels while a norwegian shipyard and a brazilian shipyard each constructed one large platform supply vessel 
in addition  during fiscal  the company took delivery of three foot next generation platform supply vessels for approximately million 
during fiscal  the company constructed and delivered to the market  for an approximate total cost of million  two of four crewboats whose construction contracts the company assumed from crewboats  inc  a privately held  leading independent provider of crewboat services in the gulf of mexico during fiscal the remaining two crewboats were delivered during the first and second quarter of fiscal for an approximate cost of million 
also in fiscal  the company delivered to the market for an approximate total cost of million  one of four foot  state of the art  fast  crew supply boats that blend the speed of a crewboat with the capabilities of a supply vessel for an approximate total cost of million 
the remaining three foot crewboats were delivered during the first half of fiscal for an approximate cost of million 
all four vessels were constructed at a us shipyard that is currently constructing one additional foot  fast  crew supply boats as discussed above 
the table below summarizes the number of vessels that have been added to the company s fleet  excluding vessels purchased from ensco on april   during fiscal  and by vessel class and vessel type number of vessels added vessel class and type deepwater vessels anchor handling towing supply platform supply vessels replacement fleet anchor handling towing supply platform supply vessels crew utility crewboats offshore tugs total number of vessels added to the fleet vessel dispositions on march   the company announced it had entered into a letter of intent to sell up to six of its kmar type of anchor handling towing supply vessels for a total amount of million 
the transaction calls for multiple closings throughout calendar year on five vessels as they end existing charters 
the sixth vessel will be sold in if certain conditions are met 
culmination of the sale  which would result in a reported gain of approximately million  is subject to buyer s inspection of the vessels and securing adequate financing by april  at april   the buyer notified tidewater that it did not satisfy one of the conditions of the sale  but still intended to continue its efforts to complete the transaction and enter into a definitive agreement at the price and terms previously agreed 
tidewater 
table of contents informed that buyer that it would continue discussing the sale of the six kmar vessels on a non exclusive basis but will also evaluate offers from third parties  should any be made 
during fiscal  the company sold three crewboats to one of its owned unconsolidated international joint ventures for million 
the company financed the sale of all three crewboats 
under the terms of the repayment agreement  the loan is payable in equal installments  which will end in december  plus interest at day libor plus adjusted quarterly 
the transaction resulted in a fiscal gain on sale of assets of million and increased the investments in  at equity  and advances to unconsolidated companies account by million 
the company also sold one deepwater platform supply vessel and one crewboat to the same owned unconsolidated joint venture for million during fiscal the company financed the million sale of the deepwater vessel  while the joint venture paid million cash for the crewboat 
the repayment agreement calls for the loan to be payable in equal installments  which will end in april  plus interest at day libor plus adjusted quarterly 
the transactions resulted in a fiscal gain on sale of assets of million and increased the investments in  at equity  and advances to unconsolidated companies account by million 
while the company has been building or acquiring new vessels during the last few years  it also has sold and or scrapped vessels between april and march the mix of vessels disposed of includes towing supply supply vessels  crew utility vessels  offshore tugs and other vessels  primarily barges 
impairment of long lived assets during fiscal  numerous marine drilling rigs exited the us gulf of mexico despite attractive domestic oil and gas commodity pricing for an extended period of time 
these departures  combined with the low activity levels of traditional gulf of mexico operators  left the active offshore rig count at its lowest level in ten years 
by late fiscal  the company concluded based on mounting extrinsic evidence that low activity levels in the gulf of mexico could possibly persist for a period of time 
management reviewed the recoverability of the values of its gulf of mexico operating assets and recorded in march a non cash asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share relating to older gulf of mexico supply vessels 
as a result of the prolonged weakness in the gulf of mexico drilling market  the vessels were cold stacked for as long as several years and were viewed as unlikely to return to service 
due to the average age of the vessels years  outdated specifications low horsepower and cargo capacities relative to competing equipment  significant costs to repair and return the vessels to service average approximately  per vessel and an anticipation of low customer demand for the vessels in the future  the company concluded it was unlikely that these vessels would ever return to active service 
based on the determination  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the asset impairment charge noted above was taken to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value at march  the fair value of the vessels was determined based upon management s estimate of liquidation values that could be realized in sales to unrelated purchasers and included an assumption that a significant number of the vessels as much as may have to be scrapped 
disposal of the assets may take an extended period of time due to the vessels outdated specifications and depressed market conditions in the gulf of mexico 
one of the impaired vessels was sold during fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reviewed  for impairment purposes  all vessels that were currently cold stacked and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share to reduce the carrying amount of vessels that are unlikely to return to active service 
the company has previously disclosed that it is the subject of an informal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission sec related to the million impairment charge that it recorded in its fiscal year ended march  that was related to cold stacked vessels that had been used in the gulf of mexico 
the company is in discussions with the sec in an effort to resolve the matters raised by the inquiry 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the timing or ultimate outcome of these discussions 

table of contents general market conditions and results of operations offshore service vessels provide a diverse range of services and equipment to the energy industry 
fleet size  utilization and vessel day rates primarily determine the amount of revenues and operating profit because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally when revenue changes 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors that affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demands  vessel age and scheduled drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
whenever possible  vessel drydockings are done during seasonally slow periods to minimize any impact on vessel operations and are only done if economically justified  given the vessel s age and physical condition 
the following table compares revenues and operating expenses excluding general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense for the company s vessel fleet for the years ended march vessel revenues and operating costs relate to vessels owned and operated by the company  while other marine services relate to third party activities of the company s shipyards  brokered vessels and other miscellaneous marine related activities

the company will recognize the amounts as revenue as cash is collected or at such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal the company s domestic results of operations are primarily driven by natural gas exploration and production 
persistent weakness in the natural gas drilling market in the us gulf of mexico continues to have a negative impact on the company s domestic results of operations during fiscal  however  prospects for growth in the offshore drilling market in the gulf of mexico are showing promise because of several positive developments that occurred during fiscal in august  the western gulf of mexico lease sale received solid bids 
bids for shallow water tracts were up and high bids for deepwater tracts increased from the previous year s sale 
the texas state lease sale  which was held in january  is reported to have had its best showing in six years and the independent exploration and production e p companies were the dominant bidders at the central gulf of mexico lease sales held in march analysts forecast that worldwide e p expenditures will increase in calendar year due to continuing strong demand for natural resources despite historically high crude oil prices and lofty natural gas prices 
a sizeable portion of the increase in capital spending is expected to be spent in north america 
industry analysts report that many companies plan on increasing their calendar year e p budgets on deepwater activities in the gulf of mexico 
offshore rig demand has been strong lately and drilling activity is likely to remain high in the coming months 
the e p companies have contracted offshore drilling rigs for longer durations than in past periods due to concerns over rig availability in the domestic market 
the market for offshore support vessels tightened during fiscal as drilling operators discovered that offshore vessels currently in service are in short supply 
the gulf of mexico supply boat market still has a significant number of vessels stacked that could resume active status  but only after significant expenditures to drydock and re certify the vessels 
on the other hand  natural gas pricing is a critical factor in e p companies development of capital spending budgets 
weather has been a major driver of natural gas pricing during calendar year the latter half of calendar witnessed natural gas inventories exceeding five year inventory averages due to mild summer and winter weather 
disappointing storage withdrawals due to the mild weather applied downward pressure on natural gas commodity prices 
at the present time  the downward pricing trend appears to have reversed as inventories for natural gas began decreasing during the first quarter of calendar year given these opposing developments  it is difficult for management to predict how domestic based vessel demand will be affected during the upcoming quarters but is nonetheless pleased by the developing strength in the offshore drilling market 
the company s international results of operations for fiscal benefited from higher utilization and average day rates and an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for crude oil 
industry analysts forecast that demand for crude oil 
table of contents will likely remain strong throughout calendar year and beyond and expect future crude oil prices to remain at attractive levels due to continuing high consumer demand  a tightening of crude inventory supplies and concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec countries 
during fiscal  analysts estimated that profitable international offshore markets were more likely to receive notable increases in exploration and production spending in due to strong demand for crude oil and higher commodity prices for the resource 
management anticipates international vessel demand to improve along with these market conditions 
domestic based vessel revenues decreased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal due to a decrease in the number of vessels operating in the domestic market resulting from the redeployment of vessels to international growth areas  an increase in vessel sales specifically crewboats and offshore tugs and lower utilization and average day rates on the company s offshore tugs 
revenues generated by the towing supply supply vessel class  the company s major income producing vessel class in the domestic market  increased approximately compared to fiscal due to a increase in utilization and a increase in average day rates 
international based vessel revenues for fiscal increased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal due to an increase in the number of vessels operating in international markets and due to higher utilization and average day rates on the company s deepwater class of vessels  which contributed of the increase in revenue growth for fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s towing supply supply vessels operating in the international markets contributed to fiscal s international revenue growth as compared to the previous fiscal year 
other marine service revenues which consist of revenues earned on the company s shipyard operations  brokered vessel and other marine services lines of business increased approximately  or million as compared to fiscal the company s shipyard  quality shipyards  llc generated of the increase  or approximately million as they performed more third party vessel construction  repair and refurbishments during fiscal than in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal s us based operating profit increased approximately million as compared to fiscal due to a decrease in vessel operating costs  specifically crew costs and fuel  lube and supplies  and a reduction in depreciation expense primarily related to older domestic based towing supply supply vessels that were determined impaired at march  depreciation expense ceased on these vessels when the carrying values of the vessels were written down to estimated current fair market value 
the vessels were determined impaired as a result of the prolonged weakness in the gulf of mexico drilling market and due to the vessels average age years  their outdated specifications low horsepower and cargo capacities relative to competing equipment  the significant costs to repair and return these vessels to service average approximately  per vessel  the anticipation of lower customer demand for the vessels in the future  and management s conclusion that it was unlikely that the vessels would return to active service 
based on this determination  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 an asset impairment charge of million was recorded to write down the carrying value of these assets to fair value at march  an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal to reduce the carrying amount of vessels that are unlikely to return to active service 
international based vessel operating profit was comparable to fiscal despite higher revenues due to increases in international vessel operating costs  specifically crew costs  fuel  lube and supplies  and depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of vessels including vessels moved by the company from the gulf of mexico operating in the international market 
due to the level of vessel activity experienced and to a positive safety performance on a year to date basis  marine results of operations for fiscal includes million of net insurance premium rebates as provided for in our insurance program 
the company has an opportunity to obtain additional insurance premium rebates in the future should the positive safety performance continue 
the company recorded million of premium rebates during fiscal 
table of contents fiscal s gain on sales of assets increased approximately compared to fiscal due to an increase in the number of vessels sold 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal s results of operations were lower than the previous fiscal year due to a weak us gulf of mexico natural gas drilling market and to lower utilization in certain international markets  particularly west africa and southeast asia 
a prolonged weakness in the natural gas drilling market in the gulf of mexico continued to impact the company s domestic results of operations 
with the addition of several new build vessels delivered to the domestic fleet during the fiscal and the additional vessels acquired from ensco on april   domestic based vessel revenues increased from prior year levels  but utilization rates  especially for the company s towing supply supply vessels  remained at a depressed level 
strong natural gas commodity prices and tight inventory levels for the resource for the majority of fiscal did not stimulate gas drilling in the gulf of mexico market 
the reasons for the continuing low level of offshore drilling and exploration activity were not fully known 
market analysts expected natural gas commodity prices would increase during calendar year due to the global economic recovery they believed was underway 
industry pundits predicted for some time that commodity prices for the resource would be sustainable at higher levels  which historically has been a positive indicator for increased drilling activity 
whether sustained higher natural gas prices resulted in increased drilling levels or demand for the company s vessels in the gulf of mexico during the foreseeable future was uncertain 
although the international offshore marine service industry overall benefited from high crude oil prices and strong worldwide consumer demand for oil  the company s international results of operations for fiscal were negatively affected by lower utilization rates  particularly in the west african and southeast asian markets because of decreased drilling activity 
industry analysts forecasted that demand for crude oil would remain strong throughout calendar as a result of the global economic recovery that was underway and expected future crude oil prices to remain at highly attractive levels due to high consumer demand and a reduction in crude oil production output by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
international capital expenditures by the exploration and production companies for calendar year were estimated to increase by approximately over calendar year levels 
domestic based vessel revenues increased approximately as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increased number of company vessels operating in the domestic market resulting from the addition of several new build vessels during fiscal and the acquisition of the ensco vessels on april  although the company s seven deepwater class of vessels operating in the gulf contributed approximately of the revenue growth for fiscal as compared to fiscal  it is the company s towing supply supply vessel class that is the major income producing vessel class in the domestic market 
the higher number of towing supply supply vessels operating in the domestic market helped generate approximately higher revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal utilization rates for the towing supply supply vessels were comparable to fiscal utilization  however  average day rates declined approximately during fiscal the company s average day rates remained at high levels as compared to the average day rates experienced during the last industry downturn 
utilization rates in the us gulf of mexico  however  remain at the lowest levels the company has experienced in over a decade due in part to management s strategic decision to maintain higher average day rates at the expense of lower utilization and in part to a lower demand for vessels in the gulf of mexico 
due to the lack of demand at the higher day rate level  the company cold stacked towing supply supply vessels  all but one vessel required a drydock before returning to service 
faced with the realization that the low level of vessel demand could persist for some time  management reviewed the recoverability of the values of its gulf of mexico operating assets and determined that it was unlikely that older supply vessels would ever return to active service due to the vessels average age  their outdated specifications relative to competing equipment and significant costs to repair and return these vessels to service and consequently recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share in march a full discussion of the impairment of long lived assets is disclosed in impairment of long lived assets section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also  the company s offshore tugs operating in the gulf experienced a increase in revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher utilization as a result of an increase in construction activity  ocean barge towing and an increase in rig moving for ensco 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ensco vessels  it was agreed 
table of contents that  for a period of two years and subject to satisfactory performance  the company would provide to ensco all of their discretionary vessel requirements in the gulf of mexico 
international based vessel revenues declined a modest as compared to fiscal due to lower utilization rates in certain international markets 
average day rates for fiscal increased for the entire international based fleet but were insufficient to mitigate the negative effect lower utilization had on revenues 
in november of the company purchased seven deepwater vessels that were fulfilling bareboat contractual obligations at the time of purchase 
only one of the original seven bareboat contractual obligations existed by the end of fiscal as six of the original bareboat charters expired at various times during fiscal the bareboat charter agreement on the remaining vessel expired in the first quarter of fiscal in a bareboat charter agreement  the bareboat charterer leases a vessel for a pre arranged fee and is able to market the vessel and is also responsible for providing the crew and all other operating costs related to the vessel 
for the vessel that the company has under bareboat contract  only revenue and depreciation expense are recorded related to the vessel s activity 
as the company incurs no operating costs related to the vessels  the related bareboat day rates are less than comparable vessels operating under normal charter hire arrangements 
for fiscal year ended march   the bareboat chartered deepwater vessels experienced utilization and an average day rate of approximately  the international based deepwater vessel fleet  excluding the bareboat chartered vessels discussed above  experienced approximately utilization and an average day rate of approximately  for the fiscal year ended march  other marine service revenues increased million  or approximately as compared to fiscal the company s shipyard  quality shipyards  llc generated million of the increase 
quality shipyards  llc performed more third party vessel construction  repair and refurbishments during fiscal than in the prior fiscal year 
prior to fiscal  the shipyard was constructing vessels for tidewater and did not have much excess capacity for third party construction jobs 
us based operating losses increased approximately million as compared to fiscal due to higher depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of vessels operating in the domestic market and due to higher vessel operating costs  primarily crew costs despite implementing significant cost cutting measures that resulted in the reduction of us shore based and fleet personnel during the latter part of the second quarter of fiscal  repair and maintenance  and fuel  lube and supplies 
higher vessel operating costs pertained primarily to the new vessels added to the domestic fleet during fiscal contributing to fiscal domestic operating losses was the cost associated with the cold stacked supply vessels  which contributed approximately million of costs million of depreciation expense and million of vessel operating costs to the domestic results of operations 
international based vessel operating profit decreased approximately as compared to fiscal due to earning lower revenues resulting from reduced vessel utilization and due to higher vessel operating costs driven primarily by greater crew costs related to new vessels added to the fleet since the previous year  higher repair and maintenance costs  and due to increases in fuel  lube and supply costs resulting from furnishing the new vessels and mobilizing them to their areas of operations 
vessel class statistics vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated on active vessels only and  as such  do not include vessel withdrawn from active service or joint venture vessels 

table of contents effective april   the company excludes from its utilization statistics the domestic based towing supply supply vessels determined impaired in march as disclosed in the impairment of long lived assets section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

liquidity  capital resources and other matters the company s current ratio  level of working capital and amount of cash flows from operations for any year are directly related to fleet activity and vessel day rates 
fleet activity and vessel day rates are ultimately determined by the supply demand relationship for crude oil and natural gas 
variations from year to year in these items are primarily the result of market conditions 
as a result of recent vessel purchases and cash expenditures for vessel construction programs  the company s cash balances at march  and and are relatively minimal

the company had million in outstanding borrowings from the amended revolving credit agreement at may  on july   the company issued million of senior unsecured notes 
the multiple series of notes with maturities ranging from years to years have an average outstanding life to maturity of years and can be retired before maturity without penalty 
the average interest rate on the notes sold to private institutional investors is 
the note proceeds were used to refinance a then existing million debt outstanding  with the balance of the proceeds used to fund capital expenditures 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for any fiscal year will fluctuate according to the level of business activity for the applicable year 
fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher earnings due to a better business environment than the previous fiscal year

table of contents interest and debt costs interest and debt costs incurred  net of interest capitalized  for fiscal  and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
interest costs capitalized during fiscal  and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
total interest and debt costs incurred in fiscal were considerably higher than the previous two fiscal years as a result of increased debt levels 
the relative portion of interest cost capitalized during fiscal was less than prior fiscal years due to the reduced level of investments in the company s new construction program during the current fiscal year 
other liquidity matters while the company does not have any other commitments for new build vessel contracts other than what is discussed in the vessel construction programs and acquisitions section of item  the company anticipates that over the next several years  it will continue its vessel building and or new vessel acquisition program in order to replace its aging vessels 
the majority of the company s supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and will need to be replaced within the next several years 
in addition to age  market conditions will also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows and borrowing capacities to fund over the next few years significant capital expenditures  primarily relating to the continuing replacement of the company s international anchor handling towing supply vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels 
the company believes that adequate capital resources will be available to maintain the existing fleet and continue its vessel building program 
at the conclusion of its examination of the company s income tax returns covering fiscal and  the internal revenue service irs proposed changes to taxable income which  if sustained  would result in additional income tax of million 
the proposed increase in taxable income results primarily from the irs disallowance of all claimed deductions from taxable income related to the company s foreign sales corporation fsc as well as all deductions claimed under the extraterritorial income exclusion eti 
the company has filed a formal protest with the irs seeking a reconsideration of the position taken 
the company has received a final assessment of additional income tax of million resulting from the irs s earlier examination of the company s income tax returns for fiscal and such assessment is due to the irs disallowance of essentially all deductions related to fsc activity during this period 
the company intends on challenging the disallowed fsc deduction through legal proceedings 
the company also has additional ongoing examinations by state and foreign tax authorities 
the company does not believe that the results of these examinations will have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
a subsidiary of the company is a participating employer in an industry wide multi employer retirement fund in an international area 
the company has learned of the fund s deficit that may ultimately require contributions from the participating employers throughout the industry 
the contribution that may be required from the company will depend on a number of factors including a current calculation of the total fund deficit  the number of participating employers  and an allocation of the required contributions to participating employers  among others 
the company has engaged the assistance of outside advisors  but is currently unable to determine the outcome of this matter and the related impact it might have on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not expect a formal demand for contribution  if any  until the end of calendar 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s consolidated contractual obligations as of march  and the effect such obligations  inclusive of interest costs  are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than one year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations vessel construction obligations total off balance sheet arrangements the company currently does not utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance its liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements would be analyzed and disclosed by the company s management 
certain known trends  events  uncertainties and risk factors the company operates in a business environment that has many risks 
listed below are some of the more critical risk factors that affect the company and the offshore marine service industry and should be considered when evaluating any forward looking statement 
the effect of any one risk factor or a combination of several risk factors could materially affect the company s results of operations and financial condition and the accuracy of any forward looking statement made in this form k 
oil and gas prices are highly volatile 
commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile 
prices are extremely sensitive to the supply demand relationship for the respective natural resources 
high demand for crude oil and natural gas and or low inventory levels for the resources as well as any perceptions about future supply interruptions can cause commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas to rise  while generally  low demand for natural resources and or increases in crude oil and natural gas supplies cause commodity prices for the respective natural resources to decrease 
factors that affect the supply of crude oil and natural gas include but are not limited to the following the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec ability to control crude oil production levels and pricing  as well as  the level of production by non opec countries  political and economic uncertainties  advances in exploration and development technology  worldwide demand for natural resources  and governmental restrictions placed on exploration and production of natural resources 
changes in the level of capital spending by our customers 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
the company s results of operations are highly dependent on the level of capital spending by the energy industry 
the energy industry s level of capital spending is substantially related to the demand for the resource and the prevailing commodity price of natural gas and crude oil 
during periods of low commodity prices  the company s customers generally reduce their capital spending budgets for offshore drilling  exploration and development 
historically  strong fundamentals such as high commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil  tight inventory levels for the resources along with strong consumer demand have been positive indicators for increases in capital spending by the company s customers 
the us natural gas market has experienced 
table of contents strong fundamentals during recent years  however  the positive indicators did not stimulate the company s customers operating in the u 
s 
gulf of mexico to substantially increase their capital spending during that time 
the offshore marine service industry is highly competitive 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
competitive factors include price and quality of service by vessel operators and the quality and availability of vessels 
decreases in the level of offshore drilling and development activity by the energy industry generally negatively affect the demand for the company s vessels thereby exerting downward pressure on day rates 
extended periods of low vessel demand and or low day rates will reduce the company s revenues 
also  excess marine service capacity exerts downward pressure on day rates 
excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the market and when vessels are mobilized between market areas 
while the company has committed to the construction of several vessels  it has also sold and or scrapped a significant number of vessels over the last few years 
a discussion about the aging of the company s fleet that has necessitated the company s new vessel construction programs appears in the vessel construction programs and acquisitions section of item failure to attract and retain key management and technical personnel 
the company s success depends upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  particularly the company s area managers and fleet personnel  and our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of a number of the company s executive officers  area managers  fleet personnel or other key employees  or our ability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel could harm the company 
the company currently does not carry key employee life insurance payable to the company with respect to any of its management employees 
risks associated with operating internationally 
for the fiscal years ended march   and    and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were generated by international operations 
the company s international marine vessel operations are vulnerable to the usual risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the united states 
such risks include political and economic instability  possible vessel seizures or nationalization of assets and other governmental actions  the ability to recruit and retain management of overseas operations  currency fluctuations and revaluations  and import export restrictions  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war  or hostility  have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
to date  the company has not experienced any property losses or material adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition as a result of terrorism  political instability or war 
at present  the company believes the risks of operating internationally to be within acceptable limits and  in view of the mobile nature of the company s principal revenue producing assets  does not consider them to constitute a factor materially adverse to the conduct of its international marine vessel operations as a whole 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the recorded values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company s estimates and assumptions affect its recognition of deferred expenses  bad debts  income taxes  the carrying value of its long lived assets and goodwill  and its provision for certain contingencies 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 

table of contents management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to one week 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for doubtful accounts 
the company self insures potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
goodwill 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  using carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and international operations 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s related weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying 
table of contents value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics are grouped for asset impairment testing 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
during fiscal  the company refined its asset groupings to increase the number of asset groups and better reflect the composition of its fleet and the markets within which it currently operates 
in addition to the periodic review of long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels every six months 
this review considers items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked and likelihood of a return to active service  among others 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a stacked vessel that is unlikely to return to active service exceeds its estimated fair value 
income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on that the company s belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs 
the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also has the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year period and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the company also sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan that covers eligible us fleet personnel and eligible employees of the company hired after december  and a post retirement plan for qualified retired employees 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of assumptions including the discount rate  the rate 
table of contents of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  amortization of prior service costs or benefits  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also provides postretirement benefits to qualified retired employees 
the postretirement program provides limited health care and life insurance benefits 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits 
this plan is not funded 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance that had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only 
this standard  together with a new rule adopted by the securities and exchange commission in april  is effective for the company as of april  and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date 
the ultimate amount of increased compensation expense will be dependent on the number of option shares granted  their timing and vesting period and the method used to calculate the fair value of the awards  among other factors 
the company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on its results of operations and cash flows in the future 
effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as the spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
environmental matters during the ordinary course of business the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations 
the company attempts to comply with these laws and regulations in order to avoid costly accidents and related environmental damage 
compliance with existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any environmentally hazardous material aboard its vessels and at shore base locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risk 

table of contents interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
the company s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are its cash equivalents and long term borrowings 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the cash equivalent investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investments 
the book value for cash equivalents is considered to be representative of its fair value 
on may   the company amended its million revolving line of credit agreement 
the amended agreement  which expires on may   increased the face amount of the facility from million to million and includes a mechanism for increasing the amount of the facility up to million 
borrowings bear interest at the company s option  at the greater of prime or federal funds rates plus 
or libor rates plus margins from 
to based on the company s funded debt to total capitalization ratio 
the amended agreement reduced the annual fee on the unused portion of the facility to a range between 
to 
and modified certain financial covenants  which would allow for more flexibility in utilizing the facility 
during fiscal  the company signed a million revolving credit agreement which replaced a million revolving credit and term loan agreement 
under the million revolving credit agreement  borrowings bear interest at the company s option  at prime or federal funds rates plus 
or libor rates plus margins from 
to based on the company s funded debt to total capitalization ratio 
the million revolving credit commitment will expire on april  any borrowings under the agreement are unsecured and the company pays an annual fee of 
to 
on the unused portion of the facility which is determined by the company s funded debt to total capitalization ratio 
at march   the company had million of debt outstanding of which million represents unsecured borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility 
the fair market value of borrowings under the revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value because the borrowings bear interest at variable market rates  which currently range from to percent 
monies were borrowed under the revolving credit facility to help finance the company s new build program previously disclosed 
a one percentage point change in the market interest rate on the million of borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility at march  would change the company s interest costs by million annually 
the remaining million represents senior unsecured notes that were issued on july  the multiple series of notes with maturities ranging from years to years have an average outstanding life to maturity of years and can be retired before maturity 
the average interest rate on the notes is 
the fair value of this debt at march  is estimated to be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk 
the company s financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and currency commitments 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the company enters into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its risk management objectives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
the company had three currency spot contracts outstanding at march  totaling approximately million that settled on april  the company had no spot contracts outstanding at march  and the company had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at march   and that qualified as a hedge instrument 
for full disclosure on the company s derivative financial instruments see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents because of its significant international operations  the company is exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risk on all contracts in foreign currencies 
the company does not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a majority of its services in united states dollars 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollar
