item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general consol energy had net income of million for the twelve months ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the twelve months ended december  net income for was improved due to increased coal and gas sales volume and increased average sales prices for both coal and gas 
pre tax earnings also improved million due to the recognition of the favorable effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of net income also improved due to the gain on sale of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  cnx australia pty limited  to certain affiliates of amci  inc in addition  net income improved due to an increased tax benefit related to the release of million of contingent income tax liability resulting from the settlement of the federal  state and foreign income tax audits of prior years 
also  additional income resulted from the cumulative effect of change in accounting related to workers compensation in these increases in net income were offset  in part  by higher cost of goods sold attributable to higher sales volumes of coal and gas and to higher unit costs for coal and gas produced 
higher cost per ton of coal produced was due mainly to increased labor  supply and combined fund premiums per unit produced 
higher cost of gas produced was attributable to increased royalty cost and cost of firm transportation incurred by the gas operations 
increases in net income were also offset  in part  by million of accelerated depreciation  depletion and amortization taken for equipment and facilities at rend lake and other idled mining operations 
while there are no current plans for the use of the equipment or facilities  these mines have existing reserves that could be accessed from other locations or through new facilities 
total coal sales for the twelve months ended december  were million tons  including our portion of sales by equity affiliates  of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations  by our equity affiliates or sold from inventory of company produced coal  including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates 
this compares with total coal sales of million tons for the twelve months ended december   of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations or sold from inventory of company produced coal including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates 
the increase in tons sold was due primarily to the loveridge mine resuming production in march and increased production at the mcelroy mine 
loveridge experienced a fire in february while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore it had no production in mcelroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during and improved mining conditions compared to several other mines increased production in compared to consol energy produced million tons  including our portion of production at equity affiliates in compared to million tons  including our portion of production at equity affiliates in sales of coalbed methane gas  including our share of the sales from equity affiliates were billion cubic feet in compared to billion cubic feet in the increased sales volume is primarily due to higher production volumes as a result of our on going drilling program 
our average sales price for coalbed methane gas  including our portion of sales from equity affiliates  was per thousand cubic feet in compared to per thousand cubic feet in we believe that the gas market price increases were largely attributable to continued concerns over levels of north american gas production  as well as increased oil prices and the economic recovery which resulted in greater electricity use in our principal markets 
consol energy restated first quarter net income by approximately million to reflect the recognition of the favorable effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of as of march  in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance 
consol energy s buchanan mine  located near keen mountain  virginia  experienced a large rock fall behind its longwall mining section on february  while caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process  the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area 
consol energy has temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the localized fire that developed after the ignition 
based on a review of gas samples from the mine 
table of contents that have been collected and analyzed by consol energy as well as by state and federal safety officials  it has been determined that the fire exists in a localized area adjacent to the longwall mining system 
in addition to sealing the mine  consol energy plans to drill several boreholes from the surface into the area of the mine where the problem is believed to be located 
an initial borehole drilling has penetrated the mine at the place where a mine fire was suspected to have started 
video equipment lowered into the borehole to visually inspect the area shows that the location is clear of any fire or smoke 
various materials  including nitrogen foam and water will be pumped into the area in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire 
the mine is currently idle and will not produce coal while the mine is sealed 
gas production from this area may also be curtailed due to the idling of the buchanan longwall 
gas production from this area averaged thousand cubic feet per day in january results of operations twelve months ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  amounts reported in millions net income net income changed primarily due to the following items dollar variance percentage change coal sales produced and purchased gas sales produced gas sales purchased other sales and other income total revenue and other income coal cost of goods sold produced and purchased produced gas cost of goods sold purchased gas cost of goods sold other cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold depreciation  depletion and amortization taxes other than income other total costs earnings loss before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income taxes earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting cumulative effect of change in accounting net income loss net income for was improved due to increased coal and gas sales volumes and increased average sales prices for both coal and gas 
pre tax earnings also improved million due to the recognition of the favorable effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of as of march  in accordance with accounting guidance 
also  net income was improved million due to the gain on sale of the stock of consol energy s wholly owned subsidiary  cnx australia pty limited  to certain affiliates of amci  inc in addition  net income improved due to an increased tax benefit related to the release of million of contingent income tax liabilities resulting from the settlement of the federal  state and foreign income tax audits of prior years 
also  an additional million of income from the cumulative effect of change in accounting related to workers compensation was recognized in compared to million of income for mine 
table of contents closing  perpetual care and gas well closing costs recognized in these increases in net income were offset  in part  by higher cost of goods sold attributable to higher sales volumes of coal and gas and to higher unit costs for coal and gas produced 
higher cost per ton of coal produced was due mainly to increased labor  supply and combined fund premiums per unit produced 
higher cost of gas produced was attributable to increased royalty cost and cost of firm transportation incurred by the gas operations 
increases in net income were also offset  in part  by million of accelerated depreciation  depletion and amortization taken for equipment and facilities at rend lake and other idled mining operations 
while there are no current plans for the use of the equipment or facilities  these mines have existing reserves that could be accessed from other locations or through new facilities 
revenue revenue and other income increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change sales produced coal produced coal related party total produced coal purchased coal produced gas purchased gas industrial supplies other total sales freight revenue freight related party total freight other income total revenue and other income the increase in company produced coal sales revenue was due mainly to higher volumes sold during the period to period comparison and an increase in average sales price per ton 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increase in tons sold was due primarily to the loveridge mine resuming production in march and increased production at the mcelroy mine 
loveridge experienced a fire in february while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore it had no production in mcelroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during and improved mining conditions compared to the increase in company produced coal sales revenue was also attributable to the increase in average sales price per ton sold 
the increase in average sales price reflects stronger prices negotiated in and an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for coals sold to domestic and foreign utilities and for metallurgical coal 

table of contents the increase in company purchased coal sales revenue was due to higher average sales price per ton of purchased coal  offset  in part  by a decrease in tons of purchased coal sold 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increased average sales price is primarily due to some of the purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets 
increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes in compared to the increase in gas sales revenue was primarily due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet and increased volumes sold in compared to variance percentage change produced gas gross sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet we believe that the gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of north american gas production  as well as increased oil prices and the economic recovery which resulted in greater electricity use in our principal markets 
consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length from a single day to greater than a year 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
in  these financial cash flow hedges represented of our produced gas sales volumes at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
we currently intend to cover approximately of our estimated production volume with gas swap transactions 
consol energy sold of its produced gas sales volumes in under fixed priced contracts at an average price of per thousand cubic feet compared to of its gas sales volumes under fixed price contracts in at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
higher sales volumes in were a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program  which allowed consol energy to take advantage of increased prices 
consol has entered into fixed price gas sales contracts with various marketers  representing approximately of total projected production  at an average price of mcf in order to manage price fluctuations and achieve more predictable cash flows 
due to the potential curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to consol energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the columbia gas transmission corporation s interstate gas pipeline  referred to as the pipeline  consol energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during the first firm transportation arrangement covered the may through october period 
consol energy expects to experience potential production curtailments through spring and summer of due to capacity constraints continuing on the pipeline 
in november  consol energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for fixed capacity on the pipeline to offset a portion of the expected impact from the estimated curtailments 
this arrangement covers the november through october period 
as of february  the purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately of our projected production for the same period 
in addition  in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers  we purchased gas from and sold gas to other gas suppliers  which increased our revenues and our costs 
variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet the increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was due to increased sales volumes and prices 

table of contents the increase in other sales is primarily attributable to higher through put of outside coal volumes through our baltimore terminal 
freight revenue  outside and related party  is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
other income consists of interest income  gain or loss on the disposition of assets  equity in earnings of affiliates  service income  royalty income  derivative gains and losses  rental income and miscellaneous income 
dollar variance percentage change gain on sale of assets royalty income harbor maintenance fee refund equity in loss of affiliates other miscellaneous total other revenue the gain on sale of assets is due mainly to consol energy s sale of stock in its wholly owned subsidiary  cnx australia pty limited  to certain affiliates of amci  inc for million 
certain affiliates of amci  inc 
also assumed approximately million of debt  and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges 
cnx australia pty limited  through its wholly owned subsidiary consol energy australia pty limited  owned a interest in the glennies creek mine in new south wales  australia with its joint venture partner maitland main collieries pty limited  an affiliate of amci  inc the sale was completed on february  and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the gain on sale of assets in is also related to the assignment of certain coal leases  conveyance of associated surface property  the transfer of related mining permits and the related liabilities for a location in southern west virginia that resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the additional gain on sale of assets in is related to the sale of several previously closed operations and the sale of surplus equipment 
the gain on sale of assets primarily was related to the expiration in of an option granted to a third party to purchase property for which consol energy received nonrefundable proceeds of million and gains from the sale of surplus equipment 
royalty income has increased due primarily to third parties producing additional tonnage and gas volumes from consol owned property in the period to period comparison 
other income for included a million harbor maintenance fee refund received from the federal government for prior claims related to harbor maintenance fees imposed by the federal statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional 
these claims were pursued since  and we do not expect other refunds related to these claims 

table of contents the improvement in equity losses of affiliates is primarily attributable to consol energy s equity interest in the losses of glennies creek mine in consol energy s interest in this mine was sold in february costs dollar variance percentage change cost of goods sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal produced gas purchased gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to the increased produced tons sold and an increase in the average cost per ton of produced coal sold 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton produced tons sold increased due primarily to the loveridge mine resuming production in march and increased production at the mcelroy mine 
loveridge experienced a fire in february while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore this location had no production in mcelroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during and improved mining conditions compared to several other mines increased production in compared with average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton also increased in compared to this increase was attributable to higher supply costs and labor per unit produced 
increased supply costs were related to the higher costs of materials  especially metal products  used in the mining process experienced in compared to increased labor and supply costs were also attributable to additional continuous miner shifts in continuous mining machines are used to mine the coal reserve in such a way that large  rectangular blocks of coal  called panels  are delineated underground in preparation for mining by larger more efficient longwall machines in mines equipped with these systems 
typically  mines attempt to delineate more than one panel in advance so that as the longwall machine completes the extraction of the coal in one panel  it can move without delay to another prepared panel 
continuous mining machines are more labor intensive and use more supplies per ton of coal produced than longwall mining systems 
also  consol energy production from non longwall mines required additional continuous mining machine shifts to maintain prior year production levels at these locations 
increased average cost per ton was also due to increased combined fund premiums related to a premium differential announced by the social security administration for the past eleven plan years for beneficiaries assigned to consol energy 
the increase was approximately million for the plan year beginning october   of which all has been expensed from october  through september  approximately million of expense was recognized in these increases in costs per ton were offset  in part  by reduced other post employment benefits due to the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in 
table of contents purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to higher average cost per ton  offset  in part  by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton the increase in cost of goods sold and other charges for purchased coal was primarily due to higher average cost per ton of purchased coal sold in compared to the increase in the average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to increased market prices for export and metallurgical coal 
the increase in cost of goods sold and other charges was offset  in part  due to a slight decrease in volume of purchased coal sold 
produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased average cost per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes 
variance percentage change produced gas gross sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet the increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was attributable to a increase per thousand cubic feet in royalty expense 
royalty expense increased primarily due to the increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in compared to average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold also increased approximately related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the columbia gas transmission corporation s interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to consol energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline 
consol energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline from the may through october period to assure firm pipeline capacity of our projected production 
in november  consol energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for use on the pipeline 
this arrangement covers november through october the purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately of our projected production for the same period 
these increases were offset  in part  by various reduced costs in  none of which were individually material 
cost of goods sold and other charges for produced gas also increase due to increased sales volume in as a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program 
in addition  in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers  we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers  which increased our revenues and our costs 
we believe this type of transaction will continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the columbia pipeline 
variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs of goods sold 
closed and idle mine costs were million in compared to million in the increase in cost reflects mine closing  perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments as a result of updated engineering surveys 
survey adjustments resulted in million of expense in for closed and idled locations 
closed and idle mine cost also increased approximately million due to the change in calculation of workers compensation claims 
effective january   consol energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation 
under the new method  the undiscounted liability is actuarially calculated based on 
table of contents claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
additionally  the workers compensation liability is recorded on a discounted basis  which has been actuarially determined using various assumptions 
approximately million of the increased closed and idle workers compensation increase is related to interest accretion 
the increase in closed and idle mine cost was offset by a decrease of million related to the idled rend lake mine 
rend lake mine has been idle since july closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges was also impaired by approximately million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which was individually material 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change loveridge fire mine fire supply inventory write downs other post employee benefit curtailment gain cardinal river severance and pension cost buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer litigation settlements and contingencies incentive compensation sales contract buy outs miscellaneous transactions total miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges in february  loveridge mine experienced a fire near the bottom of the slope entry that is used to carry coal from the mine to the surface 
the cost of goods sold and other charges related to extinguishing the fire was approximately million and other expenses related to the fire were approximately million  net of expected insurance recovery 
in late december  the mine had begun the process of developing a new underground area that would be mined with longwall mining equipment that was expected to be installed later in the fire delayed this installation until march of in january  mine experienced a fire along several hundred feet of the conveyor belt entry servicing the longwall section of the mine 
the fire was extinguished approximately two weeks later 
on january   the mine resumed production on a limited basis with continuous mining machines  while repairs continued on the belt entry 
the fire caused damage to the roof support system  the conveyor belt and the steel framework on which the belt travels 
repairs took several weeks to complete and were estimated to cost approximately million  net of expected insurance recovery  of which million was attributable to cost of goods sold and other related charges and million to other expenses 
longwall coal production  which accounts for the majority of coal normally produced at the mine resumed on february supply inventory write downs reflect adjustments made in to supply inventories that are unique to the equipment used at dilworth and rend lake mines where the mining activities have ceased 
due to the restructuring that occurred in december  a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately million was recognized in due to consol energy s measurement date being september  the gain was not recognized until the quarter ended march  
table of contents cardinal river mine severance and pension accruals are attributable to the costs for which consol energy remains responsible following the sale of the mine s assets 
accordingly  in  consol energy recognized the cost estimate of these plans 
in april  consol energy entered into an environmental liability transfer and indemnity agreement that transferred our liability related to the buckeye landfill superfund site to another party 
in consol energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the buckeye landfill superfund site and accordingly recognized our estimated liability for remediation of this site 
the transfer and indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately million of income 
litigation settlements and contingencies decreased due to various contingent loss accruals related to asbestos  waste management and various other contingencies in both periods  none of which are individually material 
incentive compensation expense increased in compared to due mainly to the level of earnings achieved in compared to projected annual results 
the incentive compensation package is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when consol energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets 
there was no incentive compensation expense in due to consol energy not achieving predetermined earnings targets 
in  agreements were made with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing 
cost of goods sold and other charges also decreased million due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods  none of which was individually material 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc used for the customers to whom consol energy contractually provides transportation 
freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense 
dollar variance percentage change freight expense selling  general and administrative costs have decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change wages and salaries other post employment and pension costs professional consulting and other purchased services commissions insurance other total selling  general and administrative wages and salaries for selling  general and administrative have decreased primarily due to the december reduction in workforce program 
the reduction program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling  general and administrative areas to better align with consol energy s current business strategy 
the program reduced approximately positions 
the decreases in expense as a result of these reductions were offset  in part  by the completion of the integrated information technology system provided by 
table of contents sap ag in august prior to the completion  wages and salaries for dedicated staff were capitalized as a component of the cost of the implementation project and are being amortized over seven years 
the wages capitalized for were approximately million 
costs related to other post employment benefits in have decreased from due to the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in professional consulting and other purchased services has decreased in primarily due to lower software support services  offset  in part  by professional and consulting services provided in relation to reviewing employee benefit plans and compensation packages provided by consol energy 
costs for coal commissions increased due to entering into an additional sales agreement in that requires commissions to be paid 
insurance costs increased primarily due to the cost of director and officer insurance costs incurred in for a portion of  consol energy directors and officers were previously insured under the rwe ag general liability policy 
depreciation  depletion and amortization has increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change coal gas production gathering total gas other total depreciation  depletion and amortization the increase in coal depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at the rend lake and other idle mines 
consol energy s management reviewed the condition of the assets at these idle locations and determined no plan of use for these items  and therefore abandoned the facilities 
these facilities have existing coal reserves that may be accessed from other locations or through new facilities 
gas depreciation  depletion and amortization was consistent in both and production assets are depreciated using the units of production method 
units of production depreciation was based on higher gas volumes  offset by a lower rate due to increased reserve figures at january  compared to january  gathering assets are depreciated using the straight line method and their depreciation did not change in the period to period comparison 
the increase in other depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional depreciation on the integrated information technology system installed to support business processes 
the system was implemented in stages beginning in january and was substantially complete in august 
table of contents interest expense has decreased primarily due to the following items dollar variance percentage change revolving credit facility and commercial paper long term debt other total interest expense interest expense on commercial paper and the borrowings under the revolving credit facility increased primarily due to the weighted average interest rate of per annum in compared to in the increase was offset  in part  by a reduction of million in the weighted average amount of outstanding borrowings in compared to until july  consol energy s borrowings principally were in the form of commercial paper  which bears a lower interest rate than bank borrowings 
as of july  consol energy was no longer able to participate as a seller of commercial paper due to standard and poor s lowering its rating of our short term debt 
the decrease in long term debt interest expense also reflected the scheduled payment of million principal amount of debt in june other interest expense was reduced primarily due to the increase in the amount of interest capitalized in as a result of the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flows in taxes other than income has increased primarily due to the following items dollar variance percentage change production taxes coal gas total production taxes other taxes coal gas other total other taxes total taxes other than income increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance and black lung excise taxes attributable to higher average sales prices and higher coal volumes produced in compared to increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes related to increased gas production volumes and higher average sales prices 
increased other taxes in the coal segment are primarily due to higher payroll taxes related to an increase in labor costs compared to the increased labor costs are primarily related to the late march start up of the loveridge mine 
this mine was idled in restructuring cost restructuring costs of approximately million in primarily represent the severance dollars paid related to the december reduction in workforce program implemented by consol energy 
the program 
table of contents was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling  general and administrative areas and resulted in the reduction of approximately positions and approximately million of wages  salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in also included in the restructuring costs are severance monies paid throughout for positions that have been eliminated by consol energy management in an effort to reduce costs and realign it s selling  general and administrative functions with today s company strategies 
export sales excise tax resolution consol energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export sales 
we have received refunds in for our claims and related interest for the years upon receipt of these items  we have adjusted our estimate of interest receivable to the amounts received 
this adjustment resulted in an additional million in a receivable for the claims for the years is still outstanding 
there is no interest receivable related to these claims 
income taxes variance percentage change earnings loss before income taxes tax expense benefit effective income tax rate consol energy s effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion 
the effective rate for was also impacted by the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the provision for income tax is adjusted at the time the returns are filed to reflect changes in previously estimated amounts 
the tax benefit was increased by million in and was reduced by million in related to these adjustments 
the income tax benefit also includes approximately million due to the release of a contingent income tax liability resulting from the settlement of the federal  state and foreign income tax audits of prior years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting for workers compensation  mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing costs effective january   consol energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation 
under the new method  the undiscounted liability is actuarially calculated based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
additionally  the workers compensation liability is recorded on a discounted basis  which has been actuarially determined using various assumptions  including a discount rate of and a future health care cost trend rate of  declining to in consol energy believes this change was preferable since it aligns the accounting for workers compensation with consol energy s other long term employee benefit obligations  which are recorded on a discounted basis 
additionally  it provides a better comparison with consol energy s industry peers  the majority of which  we believe  record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis 
as a result of the change  consol energy reduced its workers compensation liability by million and reduced its related deferred tax asset by million 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of million  and accordingly is reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting 
effective january   consol energy adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as required 
consol energy reflected a gain of approximately million  net of a tax cost of approximately million 
at the time of adoption  total assets  net of accumulated depreciation  increased 
table of contents approximately million and total liabilities increased approximately million 
the amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proved reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets 
in contrast  sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets  the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material 
twelve months ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  all dollar amounts in charts reported in millions net income net income changed primarily due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change coal sales produced and purchased gas sales other sales and other income total revenue coal cost of goods sold produced and purchased gas cost of goods sold other cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold depreciation  depletion and amortization interest expense other total costs earnings loss before income taxes income taxes earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss net income loss for was lower than the period primarily due to increased cost of goods sold and lower income tax benefits  offset  in part  by higher revenues and lower depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the increase in cost of goods sold was mainly attributable to higher retiree medical costs and salaried pension expenses  increased gas volumes and royalty costs related to gas sales  and costs related to mine fires at the loveridge mine and mine tax benefits were lower in primarily due to the tax effect of the current year s sale of consol energy s canadian assets 
the higher sales revenues are primarily attributable to the increased gas volumes sold in compared to the period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense declined primarily as a result of the equipment at the dilworth mine and the related preparation plant becoming fully depreciated prior to  coinciding with the closure of the mine due to economically depleted reserves

period period variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the decrease in tons sold is related to the closure of the dilworth  humphrey and windsor mines  where economically mineable reserves were depleted in the last quarter of the decrease in tons sold was also attributable to the sale of the assets at the cardinal river mine in february and the idling of the rend lake mine in due to market conditions 
expected coal production in the fourth quarter of was also impacted by unfavorable mining conditions at enlow fork mine  mill creek mine and mine  a roof fall along the west beltline at the bailey mine  equipment problems at vp and jones fork mines and flooding along the ohio river 
these decreases in tonnage were offset  in part  by increased sales of company produced coal primarily at the mcelroy mine and  to a lesser extent  at several other mines 
the increased tonnage at the mcelroy mine is attributable to the mine running for the full year compared to being idled for two months of the year 
the mcelroy mine increase is also attributable to the preparation plant expansion that was completed in the last quarter of the reductions in company produced coal sales revenue were substantially offset by the increase in average sales price per ton sold 
the increase in average sales price primarily reflects higher prices negotiated in the second half of the decrease in company purchased coal sales revenue was due mainly to a decrease in average sales price per ton of purchased coal 
period period variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the reduced average sales price is primarily due to sales of purchased coal in at prices under commitments made during periods of lower prices as compared to sales of coal purchased under commitments made during a period of higher prices 
the reduced sales price is also due to consol energy purchasing and selling a lower quality coal in compared to the period 

table of contents the increase in gas sales revenue was primarily due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet and increased volumes sold in compared to the period 
period period variance percentage change gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet including effects of derivative transactions the gas market price increases were largely driven by the overall supply demand imbalance that depleted united states storage levels by the end of march and the subsequent need to refill that storage prior to the start of the next winter heating season 
consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with our gas marketers  selling gas under short term multi month contract nominations generally not exceeding one year 
consol energy has also entered into eight float for fixed gas swap transactions and two float for collar gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges  which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
in  these cash flow hedges represented of our total produced sales volumes at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these cash flow hedges are expected to represent of our estimated produced sales volumes at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
consol energy sold of its gas sales volumes in at an average price of per thousand cubic feet compared to of its gas sales volumes in the period at per thousand cubic feet under contracts agreed to in prior periods 
higher sales volumes were a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program  which allowed consol energy to take advantage of increased demand 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was due to reduced sales volumes

these changes were offset  in part by million of additional losses in due to a coal equity affiliate s  glennies creek mine  coal recovery rate being lower due to a rock intrusion in the coal seam 
foreign currency derivative gains are related to the foreign currency hedge contracts entered into on july  to permit consol energy australia pty cea to purchase australian dollars at a fixed exchange rate 
cea entered into these hedges in order to minimize exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
consol energy sold its interest in the glennies creek mine as of february  as part of the transaction  the purchaser will assume cea s debt related to glennies creek mine and the associated hedging arrangements 
other income also includes a million refund received from the federal government for harbor maintenance fees imposed by federal statute that was declared unconstitutional 
we have pursued claims for these fees since  and we do not expect other refunds related to these claims 
the increases in other income were partially offset in compared to the period due to million of income related to a contract settlement which occurred in the period 
an additional million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
costs period period dollar variance percentage change cost of goods sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to the increased cost per unit of produced coal sold  offset  in part  by reduced sales tons 
period period variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton for produced coal increased due mainly to increased medical expenses for retired employees and increased salaried pension expenses 
retiree medical and salaried pension expenses are actuarially determined based on several assumptions as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the year ended december  cost per ton for produced coal also increased due to higher supply cost per unit 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by reduced company produced sales volumes 
purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due primarily to a reduction in the average cost per ton and reduced volumes of purchased coal sold 
period period variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton 
table of contents the reduced average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to purchasing coal in under commitments made during the prior year when prices were lower 
the lower average cost of purchased coal is also attributable to consol energy purchasing and reselling a lower quality coal in compared to the period 
gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased average cost per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes 
period period variance percentage change gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet the increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was attributable to a increase per thousand cubic feet in royalty expense 
royalty expense increased primarily due to the increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in compared to the period 
the increase is also due to additional employees  additional contractor maintenance cost and additional power charges attributable to the increased number of wells in production in the period to period comparison 
gas cost of goods sold and other charges also increased due to the increased volumes sold in as discussed previously 
we currently plan to drill approximately wells in the twelve month period ending december  variable costs on a per unit basis are not anticipated to increase as a result of the drilling program  although  due to the uncertainty of costs such as maintenance  contract labor  and corporate overhead  the incremental impact of the drilling program on per unit costs for cannot be reasonably predicted 
industrial supplies cost of goods sold decreased due to reduced sales volumes 
closed and idle mine cost decreased primarily due to approximately million of expense related to mines that were idled for all or part of the period that were operating in  or that were closed in the period 
these mines include idled loveridge  shoemaker  mcelroy  and humphrey which was closed 
closed and idle mine cost also decreased approximately million due to the reduction of workforce at rend lake mine in related to the mine being placed on long term idle status pending market conditions 
these costs also decreased approximately million due to differences in the engineering survey adjustments related to mine closing and reclamation compared to the engineering survey adjustments 
the additional million decrease in closed and idle mine cost was due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
the decreases in closed and idle mine cost were offset  in part  by approximately million of additional mine closing and reclamation expenses related to changes in the method of accounting for these liabilities 
in january  consol energy adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under this statement  the interest accretion related to the discounted portions of mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities  previously reported as interest expense  are now reported as operating expenses 
under the previous method of accounting for mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing obligations  the estimated obligations for closed mines were fully accrued and adjusted annually as the estimates were updated by engineers 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change loveridge fire mine eighty four fire litigation settlements and contingencies cardinal river severance and pension cost supply inventory write downs miscellaneous transactions 
table of contents in february  loveridge mine experienced a fire near the bottom of the slope entry that is used to carry coal from the mine to the surface 
the costs of extinguishing the fire are estimated to be approximately million attributable to cost of goods sold and other charges and other related expenses are estimated to be approximately million  net of expected insurance recovery applicable to both the cost of goods sold and other expenses 
in late december  the mine had begun the process of developing a new underground area that would be mined with longwall mining equipment that was expected to be installed later in the fire has delayed this installation until march in january  eighty four mine experienced a fire along several hundred feet of the conveyor belt entry servicing the longwall section of the mine 
the fire was extinguished approximately two weeks later 
on january   the mine resumed production on a limited basis with continuous mining machines  while repairs continued on the belt entry 
the fire caused damage to the roof support system  the conveyor belt and the steel framework on which the belt travels 
repairs took several weeks to complete and are estimated to cost approximately million attributable to cost of goods sold and other related charges and million attributable to other expenses  net of expected insurance recovery applicable to both the cost of goods sold and to other expenses 
longwall coal production  which accounts for the majority of coal normally produced at the mine resumed on february litigation settlements and contingencies increased over the prior year due to various contingent loss accruals related to various individual contingencies  waste management accruals and asbestos claims in both periods  none of which are individually material 
consol energy owned a interest in cardinal river until february  when it and related assets were sold 
cardinal river mine severance and pension accruals are attributable to the costs for which consol energy remains responsible following the sale of the mine s assets 
supply inventory write downs reflect adjustments made to supply inventories that are unique to the equipment used at locations where the mining activities have ceased  such as the dilworth and rend lake mines 
cost of goods sold and other charges also increased due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods  none of which are individually material 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc

table of contents administrative areas to better align with its current business strategy 
this program is expected to reduce approximately positions and approximately million of wages  salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in other post employment and pension costs have increased due mainly to increased medical expenses for retired employees and changes in actuarial assumptions used for pension 
retiree medical and salaried pension expenses are actuarially determined based on several assumptions as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the year ended december costs of professional consulting and other purchased services have increased in primarily due to services provided in relation to a special investigation into matters alleged in an anonymous letter and transactions in connection with the reduction by rwe rheinbraun  the former controlling stockholder  of its percentage ownership in consol energy 
other selling  general and administrative costs increased primarily due to director and officer insurance costs incurred in consol energy officers and directors were previously insured under the rwe ag general liability policy 
depreciation  depletion and amortization has decreased due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change coal gas other total depreciation  depletion and amortization the decrease in coal depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the equipment at the dilworth mine and the related preparation plant becoming fully depreciated prior to to coincide with the closure of the mine due to economically depleted reserves and other mine equipment becoming fully depreciated in the decrease also relates to lower units of production financial depletion due to lower production volumes in compared to the period

sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost 
the depreciation of these assets is generally determined on a units of production basis over the life of the producing asset 
the decrease in gas depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to a higher ratio of gas production coming from mine gob areas which have lives generally less than twelve months long 
as a result the costs to produce these areas are expensed instead of capitalized and then amortized 
this gob gas production is not included in the calculation of units of production depreciation or depletion for capitalized gas costs 
the reduction in gas depreciation  depletion and amortization was offset  in part  by additional depreciation attributable to new assets placed in service during and additional depletion and depreciation related to the increased volumes from other than gob wells produced during the reductions were also offset  in part  by a million increase due to the depreciation of the assets recorded in relation to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under this statement  the interest accretion related to the discounted portions of mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities  previously reported as interest expense  are now reported as operating expense 
interest expense on commercial paper decreased primarily due to a million reduction in the weighted average principal amount of commercial paper outstanding and a per annum reduction in the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding in as of july  consol energy was no longer able to participate as a seller of commercial paper due to standard and poor s lowering its rating of our short term debt to b 
subsequently  consol energy s debt ratings have been lowered by standard and poor s and moody s

other interest expense increased due primarily to a million increase in interest expense related to the million principal amount of notes due in  which were issued in march and therefore were not outstanding for the entire period 
this increase was offset  in part  by a million reduction in interest expense due to the reduction of long term debt through scheduled debt repayments 
taxes other than income decreased primarily due to the following items period period dollar variance percentage change payroll taxes property and other taxes capital stock and franchise tax production taxes total taxes other than income payroll taxes have decreased primarily due to the closure or idling of several mines in the period to period comparison 
dilworth  rend lake and humphrey mines were not operating in and  therefore  the average number of employees was lower in compared to the period 
decreased property and other taxes are attributable to the adjustment of prior year estimated accruals to the actual amounts paid in capital stock and franchise tax has been reduced in due to the impacts of merging several consol energy companies over the past several years 
increased production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher gas production volumes and associated sales price in compared to the period 
this increase was offset  in part  by decreased black lung excise taxes related to the lower coal production volumes 

table of contents restructuring costs restructuring costs of approximately million in primarily represent the severance dollars paid related to the december reduction in workforce program implemented by consol energy 
the program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling  general and administrative areas and is expected to reduce approximately positions and approximately million of wages  salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in also included in the restructuring costs are severance amounts paid throughout for positions that have been eliminated by consol energy management in an effort to reduce costs and realign it s selling  general and administrative functions with today s company strategies 
export sales excise tax resolution consol energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export sales 
we have received refunds and related interest in for our claims for the years to upon receipt of these refunds  we have adjusted our estimate of interest receivable to the amounts received

income taxes period period variance percentage change earnings loss before income taxes tax expense benefit effective income tax rate consol energy s effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in annual profitability and percentage depletion 
the effective tax rate changed from the effective rate primarily due to the tax effect of the current year s sale of consol energy s canadian assets 
another significant cause of the change was due to provision to return adjustments recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting for mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing costs effective january   consol energy adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as required 
consol energy reflected a gain of approximately million  net of a tax cost of approximately million 
at the time of adoption  total assets  net of accumulated depreciation  increased approximately million and total liabilities increased approximately million 
the amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets 
in contrast  sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets  the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
table of contents of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
other post employment benefits consol energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age effective august   the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age  or fifteen years of service and age additionally  any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective august  or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits 
in lieu of traditional retiree health coverage  if certain eligibility requirements are met  these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree medical spending allowance of  per year of service at retirement 
at december   a retiree health plan provided benefits to approximately  of our former employees and their eligible dependents 
eligibility requirements for hourly employees have not changed from consol energy s historical requirements 
in addition to the change in eligibility requirements  other changes have been made to the medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees 
these changes include a new cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute of plan costs 
annual cost increases in excess of are paid entirely by the plan participants 
after our review  various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs  are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the other post employment benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december   the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
per capita costs on a per annum basis for other post retirement benefits were assumed to be  at december  this was approximately a increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at december  if the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted annually  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was billion compared to billion at december  for the twelve months ended december   we paid approximately million for other post employment benefits  most of which were paid from operating cash flow 
significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on consol energy s operating cash flow 
the effect on consol energy s cash flow from operations for salaried employees has been limited to approximately of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision added to the benefit plan in

coal workers pneumoconiosis consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the coal workers pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
these and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could result in changes in assumptions used in our actuarial determination of the liability  including interest  disability and mortality assumptions 
these changes could significantly increase our exposure to black lung benefit liabilities 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  for the twelve months ended december   we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately million 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  salaried pensions consol energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer retirement plans 
the benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation near retirement 
additionally  any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective august  or later will not become eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan 
our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation  mortality rates  retirement age and interest rates 
for the years ended december  and  compensation increases are assumed to range from to depending on age classification 
retirement rate assumptions and mortality assumptions were unchanged for the year ended december  retirement rate assumptions begin at for employees at age and increases gradually to for employees at age the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the retirement plans could be effectively settled at the measurement date

table of contents december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million 
changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the estimated liability at december  was million compared to million at december  due to the negative actuarial return on plan assets  the difference in the accumulated benefit obligation and the plan assets at december  of approximately million was recognized as a minimum pension liability 
at december   the minimum pension liability was approximately million 
consol energy expects to contribute approximately million to the pension plan in the consol energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions at the employees election 
according to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year  which is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  settlement accounting is required 
if this were to occur  consol energy would need to recognize in the current year s results of operations  an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
generally  due to the lower interest rates currently being used to calculate lump sum distributions  the impact would be to recognize actuarial losses 
if this settlement accounting is triggered  the adjustment could materially impact operating results 
workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation effective january  under the new method  it records an actuarially calculated liability  which is determined using various assumptions  including discount rate and future cost trends 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the workers compensation liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the workers compensation expense 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december   including the current portion  was approximately million at december  consol energy s policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow 
no funding has been provided to cover these benefits 
for the twelve months ended december   we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly

 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities 
the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
deferred taxes consol energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a deferred tax asset of million relating to state net operating loss carry forwards has been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of these carry forwards 
however  consol energy is currently exploring several tax planning strategies that may allow a portion of the loss carry forwards to be recognized 
no other valuation allowance has been recognized because consol energy has determined that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized 
according to sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  must be considered to determine whether a valuation allowance is warranted 
for the year ended december  positive evidence considered included the level of sales and pricing currently being negotiated under fixed price contracts  the reversal of certain book to tax differences  particularly those related to minimum tax  and the ability to employ various tax planning strategies if necessary 
negative evidence included book and tax losses generated in recent periods and the inability to achieve forecasted results in those recent periods 
consol energy has concluded that the deferred tax assets  other than those associated with the state tax net operating losses  were more likely than not realizable 
by its estimation  consol energy will begin paying regular tax and utilizing its deferred tax asset associated with the minimum tax within five years 
our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  our ability to successfully execute our business strategy  as well as other factors 
these changes  if any  may require additional valuation allowances to be recorded that could materially impact net income 

table of contents coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
the majority of our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
none of our coal reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
certain trends and uncertainties in addition to the trends and uncertainties described in item i of this annual report on form k under coal operations competition  gas operations competition and regulations and in critical accounting policies and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  consol energy is subject to the trends and uncertainties set forth below 
disruption of rail  barge and other systems that deliver consol energy s coal  or of pipeline systems that deliver consol energy s gas  or an increase in transportation costs for either product could make consol energy s coal or gas less competitive 
coal producers depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lock outs or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect its profitability 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make our coal less competitive 
the marketability of consol energy s gas production partly depends on the availability  proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties 
changes in access to pipelines or increased costs of procuring transportation on pipeline systems could adversely affect our operations 
we require a skilled workforce to run our business 
if we cannot hire qualified people to meet replacement or expansion needs  we may not be able to achieve planned results 
most of our workforce is comprised of people with technical skills related to the production of coal and gas 
fifty five percent of our workforce is years of age or older 
based on our experience  we expect a high percentage of our employees to retire between now and the end of the decade 
this will require us to conduct an expanded and sustained effort to recruit new employees to replace those who retire and to fill new jobs as we 
table of contents grow our business 
some areas of appalachia  most notably in eastern kentucky  currently have a shortage of skilled labor 
because we have operations in this area  the shortage could make it more difficult to meet our manpower needs and therefore  our results may be adversely affected 
coal mining is subject to conditions or events beyond consol energy s control  which could cause its quarterly or annual results to deteriorate 
consol energy s coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines 
these mines are subject to conditions or events beyond consol energy s control that could disrupt operations  affect production and the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results 
these conditions or events have included variations in thickness of the layer  or seam  of coal  amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam and other geological conditions that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine  equipment failures or repair  fires and other accidents  and weather conditions 
consol energy faces numerous uncertainties in estimating its economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in it s estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability

each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect its actual reserves 
the exploration for  and production of  gas is an uncertain process with many risks 
the exploration for and production of gas involves numerous risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells for coalbed methane or other gas is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production  including unexpected drilling conditions  shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment  
table of contents pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or repairs  fires or other accidents  adverse weather conditions  water in the coal beds  pipeline ruptures or spills  and inadequate pipeline capacity to transport gas 
consol energy s future drilling activities may not be successful  and we cannot be sure that our drilling success rates will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could result in higher costs without any corresponding revenues 
also  consol energy may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that it identifies which  among other things  could prevent it from producing gas at potential drilling locations 
consol energy must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process and result in restrictions on its operations 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
for example  consol energy often is required to prepare and present to federal  state and local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of coal may have on the environment 
further  the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including through intervention in the courts 
accordingly  the permits consol energy needs may not be issued  or if issued  may not be issued in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements which restrict our ability to conduct its mining operations or to do so profitably 
competition within the coal and within the gas industry may adversely affect our ability to sell our products  or a loss of our competitive position because of overcapacity in these industries could adversely affect pricing which could impair our profitability 
consol energy competes with coal producers in various regions of the united states and with some foreign coal producers for domestic sales primarily to power generators 
consol energy also competes with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets 
demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by the delivered price of competing coals  other fuel supplies and alternative generating sources  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  such as hydroelectric power 
consol energy sells coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market  both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition 
during the mid s and early s  a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry  spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry  all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices 
recent increases in coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any resulting overcapacity could reduce coal prices and therefore reduce our revenues 
we compete against many gas producers who are larger and better financed than we are 
if demand for gas falls or prices are lower  we may not be able to compete profitably against these larger competitors 
in  gas prices were much lower than current prices because mild weather conditions reduced demand and led to oversupply of natural gas 

table of contents a significant decline in the prices consol energy receives for its coal and gas could adversely affect it s operating results and cash flows 
consol energy s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices it receives for its coal and gas  which are closely linked to consumption patterns of the electric generation industry and certain industrial and residential patterns where gas is the principal fuel 
extended or substantial price declines for coal or gas would adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations 
for example  in  demand for coal and natural gas decreased because of the warm winters in the northeastern united states 
this resulted in increased inventories that caused prices to decrease 
consol energy may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to fulfill its customers requirements  which could harm it s customer relationships 
consol energy may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to meet customer demand  including amounts that it is required to deliver under long term contracts 
consol energy s inability to satisfy its contractual obligations could result in its customers initiating claims against us 
our inability to satisfy demand could otherwise harm our relationships with our customers 
if customers do not extend existing contracts or enter into new long term contracts for coal  the stability and profitability of consol energy s operations could be affected 
during the twelve months ended december   approximately of the coal consol energy produced was sold under long term contracts contracts with terms of one year or more 
if a substantial portion of consol energy s long term contracts are modified or terminated or if force majeure are exercised  consol energy would be adversely affected if it is unable to replace the contracts or if new contracts were not at the same level of profitability 
the profitability of our long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors  which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term  and includes our production costs and other factors 
price changes  if any  provided in long term supply contracts are not intended to reflect our cost increases  and therefore increases in our costs may reduce our profit margins 
in addition  in periods of declining market prices  provisions for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility 
as a result  consol energy may not be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices compared to either market conditions  as they may change from time to time  or our cost structure and long term contracts may not contribute to our profitability 
the loss of  or significant reduction in  purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total revenues from sales to our three largest customers 
at december   we had approximately coal and gas supply agreements with these customers that expire at various times from to we are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers  but these negotiations may not be successful and those customers may not continue to purchase coal and gas from us under long term coal supply agreements 
if any one of these three customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us  or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 
our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines 
our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers 
our customer base is changing with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non regulated affiliates or third parties 
these new power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade 
in addition  the creditworthiness of certain of our customers and trading counterparties has 
table of contents deteriorated over the last few years due to lower than anticipated demand for energy and volatility in the traded energy markets in if deterioration of the creditworthiness of electric power generator customers or other trading counterparties continues  our million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected 
the characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards  which are continually under review by international  federal and state agencies  related to coal combustion 
as a result  they may switch to other fuels  which would affect the volume of consol energy s sales 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury  chlorine and other elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
stricter environmental regulations of emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could increase the costs of using coal thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source  the volume of our coal sales and price 
stricter regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
for example  in order to meet the federal clean air act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants  coal users may need to install scrubbers  use sulfur dioxide emission allowances some of which they may purchase  blend high sulfur coal with low sulfur coal or switch to other fuels 
each option has limitations 
lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs 
the cost of installing scrubbers is significant and emission allowances may become more expensive as their availability declines 
switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants 
because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales  the extent to which power generators switch to low sulfur fuel could materially affect us if it cannot offset the cost of sulfur removal by lowering the delivered costs of our higher sulfur coals on an energy equivalent basis 
proposed reductions in emissions of mercury  sulfur dioxides  nitrogen oxides  particulate matter or greenhouse gases may require the installation of additional costly control technology or the implementation of other measures  including trading of emission allowances and switching to other fuels 
for example  the environmental protection agency recently proposed separate regulations to establish mercury emission limits nationwide and to reduce the interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone through reductions in sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides through the eastern united states 
the environmental protection agency continues to require reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions in eastern states and the district of columbia and will require reduction of particulate matter emissions over the next several years for areas that do not meet air quality standards for fine particulates 
in addition  congress and several states are now considering legislation to further control air emissions of multiple pollutants from electric generating facilities and other large emitters 
these new and proposed reductions will make it more costly to operate coal fired plants and could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative to the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
to the extent that any new or proposed requirements affect it s customers  this could adversely affect its operations and results 
also  numerous proposals have been made at the international  national and state levels that are intended to limit or capture emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide 
if comprehensive legislation focusing on greenhouse gas emissions is enacted by the united states or individual sates  it could have the effect of restricting the use of coal 
other efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases also may affect the use of fossil fuels  particularly coal  as an energy source 
government laws  regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters increase our costs of doing business for active operations  both coal and gas  and may restrict its operations 
we are subject to laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters  
table of contents including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  groundwater quality and availability  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed and control of surface subsidence from underground mining 
complying with these requirements  including the terms of our permits  has had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on its costs of operations and competitive position 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs  including clean up costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third party damage claims for personal injury  property damage  wrongful death  or exposure to hazardous substances  as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 
for example  the federal clean water act and corresponding state laws affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on discharges into regulated waters or precluding mining that might impact regulated waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
new requirements under the clean water act and corresponding state laws could cause us to incur significant additional costs that adversely affect our operating results or may prevent us from being able to mine portions of our reserves 
in addition  consol energy incurs and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act or the superfund and similar state statutes and has been named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites in the past 
consol energy may need additional financing in order for it to fund its operations  capital expenditures  potential acquisitions and to meet other obligations 
cash generated by operations may not be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures  to provide the collateral necessary to meet workers compensation and other post employment benefits performance obligations or to fund potential acquisitions 
consol energy  along with other participants in the coal industry  has been informed by insurance companies that they no longer will provide surety bonds for workers compensation and other post employment benefits without collateral 
as a result  consol energy has satisfied these obligations by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment 
however  the issuance of letters of credit under our bank credit facilities reduces amounts that it can borrow under its bank credit facilities for other purposes  including to fund operations and capital expenditures 
for these and other reasons  consol energy may need additional financing 
consol energy cannot be certain that it will be able to raise additional financing  as required  or that any financing  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
debt financing would increase our interest expense  reducing operating results  and could include covenants that are more restrictive than those in its current financings  including limitations on the payment of dividends and on the incurrence of additional debt 
the issuance of additional equity could be dilutive to consol energy s existing stockholders 
if consol energy cannot obtain financing  it could reduce capital expenditures  particularly for expansion projects 
such a reduction in spending for these projects  however  could adversely affect future performance 
consol energy reported losses in past periods and consol energy may incur losses in future periods 
consol energy reported a net loss of million in the twelve months ended december  consol energy reported net income of million for the twelve months ended december  although consol energy reported net income for the twelve months ended december   the six months ended december  and the twelve months ended june   net income was attributable to income tax benefits in the periods ended december  and and benefited substantially from an export sales excise tax resolution in the twelve months ended june  for the twelve months ended december  and and the six months ended december   consol energy incurred losses before income tax benefits of million  million and million  respectively 
consol energy s results reflect a number of factors in each period 
for example  a decrease in tons of coal produced and tons of coal sold as a result of higher than usual customer inventory levels  decreased average sales price for gas in the industrial sector 
table of contents and lower demand for gas during the winter heating season resulted in high levels of gas storage 
during the fourth quarter of  results were adversely affected by production problems at a number of mines 
these and other conditions  including conditions beyond our control  could continue to affect our business  and we may incur losses in the future 
consol energy has significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and our experience  were million at december  the amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
furthermore  these obligations are unfunded 
if these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
if consol energy is unable to comply with restrictions imposed by its senior credit facility a default under these agreements could occur 
consol energy s senior credit facility imposes a number of restrictions on it 
a failure to comply with these restrictions could adversely affect consol energy s ability to borrow under its senior credit facility or result in an event of default under these agreements and its other debt 
the senior credit facility contains financial and other covenants that create limitations on its ability to  among other things  borrow the full amount under its senior credit facility or incur additional debt  and requires consol energy to maintain various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants 
these financial covenants include a funded debt ratio that requires that consol energy maintain a ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money as of the last day of each quarter to total earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding any extraordinary gains or losses for the four quarters ended on that date of not more than to and a ratio for the last four consecutive quarters of total earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and excluding any extraordinary gains or losses  to total interest payable including amortization of debt discount on indebtedness for borrowed money of not less than to a covenant also limits capital expenditures to million for each of the fiscal years ending december  and consol energy s ability to comply with these restrictions depends upon its operating results  and it may be unable to comply with these covenants and other restrictions in its senior credit facility 
in the event of a default  consol energy s lenders could terminate their commitments to us and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we might not be able to pay these amounts or we might be forced to seek an amendment to its debt agreements  which could make the terms of these agreements more onerous for us 
failure to comply with these restrictions  even if waived by our bank lenders  also could adversely affect our credit ratings  which could increase the costs of debt financings to us and impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing 
consol energy has significant obligations for long term employee benefits for which it accrues based upon assumptions which  if inaccurate  could result in consol energy being required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
consol energy provides various long term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees 
we accrue amounts for these obligations 
at december   the current and non current portions of these obligations included post retirement medical and life insurance billion  coal workers black lung benefits million  
table of contents salaried retirement benefits million  and workers compensation million 
however  if our assumptions are inaccurate  it could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
these obligations are unfunded  except for salaried retirement benefits  of which approximately was funded at december  in addition  several states in which we operate consider changes in workers compensation and black lung laws from time to time 
such changes  if enacted  could increase our benefit expense 
if lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to consol energy s defined benefit pension plan exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a plan year  consol energy would need to make an adjustment to operating results equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum payment in that year  which may result in an adjustment that could materially reduce operating results 
consol energy s defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from consol energy 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans for the terminations benefits  requires that if the lump sum distributions made for a plan year  which for consol energy is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  consol energy would need to recognize for that year s results of operations an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
if lump sum payments exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost  the adjustment could materially reduce operating results 
fairmont supply company  a subsidiary of consol energy  is a co defendant in various asbestos litigation cases which could result in making payments in the future that are material 
one of consol energy s subsidiaries  fairmont supply company  which distributes industrial supplies  currently is named as a defendant in approximately  asbestos claims in state courts in pennsylvania  ohio  west virginia  maryland  new jersey and mississippi 
because a very small percentage of products manufactured by third parties and supplied by fairmont in the past may have contained asbestos and many of the pending claims are part of mass complaints filed by hundreds of plaintiffs against a hundred or more defendants  it has been difficult for fairmont to determine how many of the cases actually involve valid claims or plaintiffs who were actually exposed to asbestos containing products supplied by fairmont 
in addition  while fairmont may be entitled to indemnity or contribution in certain jurisdictions from manufacturers of identified products  the availability of such indemnity or contribution is unclear at this time and  in recent years  some of the manufacturers named as defendants in these actions have sought protection from these claims under bankruptcy laws 
fairmont has no insurance coverage with respect to these asbestos cases 
to date  payments by fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material 
however  payments in the future with respect to pending or future asbestos cases could be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows of consol energy 
various federal or state laws and regulations require consol energy to obtain surety bonds or to provide other assurance of payment for certain of our long term liabilities including mine closure or reclamation costs  workers compensation and other post employment benefits 
federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or provide other assurances to secure payment of certain long term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation costs  coal leases and other miscellaneous obligations 
it has become increasingly difficult for us to secure new surety bonds or renew such bonds without posting collateral 
consol energy has satisfied its obligations under these statutes and regulations by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment 

table of contents however  letters of credit can be significantly more costly to us than surety bonds 
the issuance of letters of credit under our bank credit facility also reduces amounts that it can borrow under its bank credit facility for other purposes 
consol energy and certain of its officers are defendants in class action lawsuits alleging the defendants issued false and misleading statements to the public that could result in consol energy making substantial payments 
on october   a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on behalf of seth moorhead against consol energy  j 
brett harvey and william j 
lyons 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants violated sections b and a of the exchange act and rule b and a of the exchange act and rule b promulgated under the exchange act and that during the period between january  and july  the defendants issued false and misleading statements to the public that failed to disclose or misrepresented the following  among other things a that consol energy utilized an aggressive approach regarding its spot market sales by reserving of its production to that market  and that by increasing its exposure to the spot market  consol energy was subjecting itself to increased risk and uncertainty as the price and demand for coal could be volatile  b that consol energy was experiencing difficulty selling the production that it had allocated to the spot market  and  nonetheless  consol energy maintained its production levels which caused its coal inventory to increase  c that consol energy s increasing coal inventory was causing its expenses to rise dramatically  thereby weakening it s financial condition  and d that based on the foregoing  defendants positive statements regarding consol energy s earnings and prospects were lacking in a reasonable basis at all times and therefore were materially false and misleading 
the complaint asks the court to award unspecified damages to plaintiff and award plaintiff reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with this action  including counsel fees and expert fees 
another class action complaint has been filed in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania against consol energy and certain officers and directors 
consol energy has not yet been served with that complaint 
if consol energy is not successful in defending one or more of these lawsuits it may have to make substantial payments to the plaintiffs 
consol energy is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries 
consol energy s ability to service its debt and pay dividends to holders of its common stock will depend upon it receiving distributions or similar payments from its subsidiaries 
dividends are discretionary 
because substantially all of consol energy s operations are conducted through subsidiaries  its cash flow and  therefore  its ability to service its debt and pay dividends to holders of its common stock primarily depends upon the earnings of it s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to  or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to  consol energy 
in addition  the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to consol energy by its subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions  will be contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and subject to various business considerations 
consol energy s rights plan may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change of control 
on december   consol energy adopted a rights plan which  in certain circumstances  including a person or group acquiring  or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer that would result in a person or group acquiring  beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of consol energy common stock  would entitle each right holder to receive  upon exercise of the right  shares of consol energy common stock having a value equal to twice the right exercise price 
for example  at an exercise price of per right  each right not otherwise voided would entitle its holders to purchase worth of shares of consol energy common stock for assuming that shares of consol energy common stock had a per share value of at such time  the holder of each right would be entitled to purchase ten shares of consol energy common stock for  or a price of per share  one half its then market price 
this and other provisions of consol energy s 
table of contents rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire consol energy  which could hinder stockholders ability to receive a premium for consol energy stock over the prevailing market prices 
liquidity and capital resources consol energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings 
on june   consol energy completed a million senior secured loan agreement to replace the existing million facility 
the new agreement consists of a five year million revolving credit facility and a six year million tranche b credit linked deposit facility 
the new facility is secured by nearly all of the assets of consol energy 
consol energy s bonds that mature in and consol energy s subsidiary s medium term notes maturing in have been equally and ratably secured 
the facility can be used for letters of credit and borrowings for general corporate purposes 
in the twelve months ended december   cash collateralized letters of credit issued under a restricted cash arrangement were transferred to the tranche b facility and the million of restricted cash was released and was used to pay short term debt 
at our option  interest on borrowings under the new facility is based upon the prime base rate or london interbank offered rates libor plus a spread that is dependent on our credit rating 
the agreement has various covenants  including covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets  make investments and merge with another corporation 
we are also required to maintain a ratio of financial covenant debt  as defined  to twelve month trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda of not more than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  in addition  we are required to maintain a ratio of twelve months trailing ebitda to cash interest expense of no less than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  the revolving credit facility also has covenants restricting the level of annual capital expenditures to be made by consol energy 
the capital expenditure limit was million for the twelve months ended december  consol energy s actual capital expenditures for the twelve months ended december  were million 
at december   this facility had approximately million letters of credit issued and had million of borrowings outstanding  leaving approximately million of unused capacity 
consol energy is currently engaged in discussions to amend the existing credit facility 
among other things  the amendments may reduce costs of the facility  increase the amounts that can be borrowed  extend the term and eliminate the current limitation on capital expenditures 
we cannot be certain when the amendments will be completed or the terms we will be able to obtain 
in june  moody s investor service affirmed the rating of ba th lowest out of rating categories to the million secured bank facility  which replaced consol energy s secured million bank facility 
the rating outlook is stable 
obligations which are rated ba are considered to have speculative elements  their future cannot be considered as well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future 
uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class 
the modifier indicates that the obligation ranks in the middle of its generic rating category 
in july  standard and poor s confirmed the bb rating th lowest out of rating categories with a recovery rate of to consol energy s million secured bank facility  which replaced it s secured million bank facility 
standard and poor s defines an obligation rated bb as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues 
however  the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the recovery rating of indicates a high expectation of full recovery of principal in the event of a default 
a security rating is not a recommendation by a rating agency to buy  sell or hold securities 
the security rating may be subject to change 
in april  consol energy and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a receivables facility with financial institutions for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide  on a revolving basis  up to million of short term funding 
consol energy formed cnx funding corporation  
table of contents a wholly owned  special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiary  for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of consol energy 
under the receivables facility  consol energy and certain subsidiaries  irrevocably and without recourse  sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to cnx funding corporation 
cnx funding corporation then sells  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates  while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables 
consol energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services 
the cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution 
the receivables facility expires in at december   eligible accounts receivable total approximately million 
the subordinated retained interest at december  was million 
accounts receivable totaling million were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at december  in accordance with the facility agreement  consol energy is able to receive proceeds based upon total eligible accounts receivable at the previous month end 
related proceeds  net of repayments  of million are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the twelve months ended december  consol energy believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments  anticipated dividend payments in and to provide required letters of credit 
nevertheless  the ability of consol energy to satisfy its working capital requirements  debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond consol energy s control 
in order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future  consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length from a single day to greater than a year 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges  which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
the fair value of these contracts was a loss of million net of million of deferred tax at december  consol energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
consol energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources  depending on the size of the transaction  including debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional capital resources  including debt financing  will be available to consol energy on terms which consol energy finds acceptable  or at all 
cash flows in millions for the twelve months ended december period period change cash flows provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities changed due to the following items approximately million was received in for refunds filed for related to our black lung excise claims and related interest 
under the accounts receivable securitization facility  approximately million was received  net of amounts paid  during the twelve months ended december  compared to million received during the twelve months ended december  
table of contents coal inventories increased million tons in the twelve month period ended december  compared to a decrease of million tons in the twelve month period ended december  approximately million of insurance payments were collected in the twelve months ended december  related to the loveridge mine fire experienced in accounts receivables from the expected insurance recoveries related to the two mine fires of approximately million were recorded in operating cash flows are also improved due to increased net income as previously discussed 
net cash used in or provided by investing activities changed primarily due to the following items capital expenditures were million in compared to million in capital expenditures include the purchase of longwall shields  development work at loveridge and mcelroy and the expansion of the bailey preparation plant 
more proceeds from sales of assets received in the twelve months ended december  than in the twelve months ended december  proceeds from the sales of assets in primarily were from the sale  in february  of consol energy s canadian coal assets and port facilities to fording inc for a note and cash 
the note was exchanged for million units in the fording canadian coal trust  a newly organized publicly traded trust  which acquired the assets of fording inc consol energy sold the coal trust units in march net cash received from or used in financing activities changed primarily due to the following items  payments of million were made to repay the outstanding commercial paper balance in payments of approximately million were made in the twelve months ended december  to reduce amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facilities compared to borrowings of approximately million in the twelve months ended december  scheduled long term debt repayments of million were made in dividend payments were million in compared to million in due to the additional million shares of common stock that were issued by consol energy in september previously restricted cash of million was released due to the completion of a new million debt facility in the twelve months ended december  compared to million used to secure letters of credit with a cash backed facility in the twelve months ended december  approximately million was received in from the sale of million shares of common stock in a private placement in september the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by year within year years years after years total short term notes payable gas firm transportation obligation long term debt operating lease obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents additionally  we have long term liabilities relating to other post employment benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  defined benefit pension plans  mine reclamation and closure  and other long term liability costs 
we estimate payments  net of any applicable trust reimbursements  related to these items at december  in thousands to be payments due by year within year years years total as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular  for periods after our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
capital expenditures were approximately million in the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the twelve months ended december  we currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending december  to be approximately million  of which approximately million is maintenance of production 
however  we may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results and the availability of financing 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be million for the year ending december  our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment  the expansion of mining and gas capacity  and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations 
the projected capital expenditures for are not committed and are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity 
in addition  cash requirements to fund employee related  mine closure and other long term liabilities included above  along with obligations related to long term debt  capital and operating leases  are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity 
debt at december   consol energy had total long term debt of million outstanding  including current portion of long term debt of million 
this long term debt consisted of an aggregate principal amount of million million of notes due in  net of million unamortized debt discount 
the notes were issued at of the principal amount

consol energy is currently engaged in discussions to amend the existing credit facility 
among other things  the amendments may reduce costs of the facility  increase the amounts that can be borrowed  extend the term and eliminate the current limitation on capital expenditures 
we cannot be certain when the amendments will be completed or the terms we will be able to obtain 
stockholders equity and dividends consol energy had stockholders equity of million at december  and million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to net income for the twelve months ended december  stockholders equity also increased due to a reduction of million in the twelve months ended december  in other comprehensive losses 
these losses related primarily to the recognition of minimum pension liability as a result of the under performance of plan assets for non contributory defined benefit retirement plans 
comprehensive losses gains are generally calculated annually and reflect a number of factors including conditions in the stock markets and interest rates 
these increases were offset  in part  by various cash flow hedges related to our gas business and the payment of dividends

table of contents on november   the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations eitf 
to qualify as a discontinued operation  paragraph of fas requires that the cash flows of the disposed component be eliminated from the operations of the ongoing entity and that the ongoing entity not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposed component after the disposal transaction 
eitf provides guidance on how to interpret and apply the criteria in paragraph a elimination of cash flows and paragraph b no significant continuing involvement of fas eitf is to be effective for all periods beginning after december  previously reported operating results related to disposal transactions initiated within an enterprise s fiscal year that includes november  may be reclassified to reflect the consensus 
we do not expect this guidance to have a financial impact to consol energy in the fiscal year 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter fas 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
fas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory cost incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are current evaluating what impact this provision could have for consol energy in the fiscal year 
on october   the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 applying paragraph of fasb statement no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  in determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds eitf 
fasb statement no 
requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
eitf clarifies how an enterprise should evaluate the aggregation criteria in paragraph of fas when determining whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds may be aggregated in accordance with paragraph of fas in addition  the fasb task force has requested that the fasb staff propose a fasb staff position fsp to provide guidance in determining whether two or more operating segments have similar economic characteristics 
the task force has agreed that since the two issues are interrelated  the effective date of eitf should coincide with the future undetermined effective date of the anticipated fsp 
we are currently evaluating the positions addressed in eitf  and foresee no significant changes in the reporting practices currently used to report segment information 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
the focal point of the legislation  and the area that is expected to have the most significant impact to consol energy  is the repeal of the extraterritorial income eti exclusion 
in its place  a new provision was added  the domestic manufacturers exemption 
for the tax years  the deduction will equal of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
the percentage rises to in and to in and after 
at its october meeting  the fasb proposed that the deduction be treated as a special deduction that should be included as a permanent benefit in consol energy s estimate of its annual effective tax rate 
the act also provides for a temporary incentive to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings and profits by providing an elective dividend received deduction 
we are currently evaluating what impact this provision could have for consol energy in the tax year in the second quarter of  in response to the federal medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  the fasb finalized guidance on how employers should account for the 
table of contents medicare act fsp fas 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
as permitted by this recent accounting guidance  consol energy has recognized the benefits of the act in the twelve months ended december  with effect from march  the benefits of the act have been recognized as a reduction of approximately million in other postemployment benefit costs 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets eitf 
in this issue  the task force reached the consensus that mineral rights are tangible assets 
this consensus differed from the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which characterize mineral rights as intangible assets 
as a result  the fasb amended fas and fas to eliminate this inconsistency 
effective with the second quarter  consol energy has reclassified mineral rights as property  plant and equipment in accordance with eitf item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in operations  consol energy is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding consol energy s exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
consol energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal 
consol sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value 
consol energy uses fixed price contracts  collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas 
our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions 
consol energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base 
all of the derivative instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures 
consol energy s market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters 
consol energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose consol energy to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect consol energy s results of operations depending on market prices 
however  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax earnings for the twelve months ended december  of a hypothetical and change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of december  are provided in the following table incremental decrease in pre tax earnings assuming a hypothetical price  exchange rate or interest rate change of in millions natural gas a a consol energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments  however  such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item 
the effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses 
consol energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to portions of the through anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices 
the sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings 
when commodity prices increase  pretax income decreases 
the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of million net of million deferred tax 
we continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly 
consol energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review 
consol energy s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   consol energy had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments 
consol energy s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its revolving credit facility  under which there was million of borrowings outstanding at december  on june   consol energy completed a million senior secured loan facility to replace the existing million facility 
the new facility consists of a five year million revolving credit facility and a six year million tranche b credit linked deposit facility 
consol energy s revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of per annum during the twelve months ended december  due to the level of borrowings against this facility in the twelve months ended december   a basis point increase in the average rate for consol energy s revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period 
the fair value of consol energy s financial instruments is set forth in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
almost all of consol energy s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks
