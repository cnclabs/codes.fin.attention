item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are recognized when products are shipped to or otherwise accepted by unaffiliated customers pursuant to customers orders  the price is defined and collection is reasonably assured 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business  but generally does not require collateral or any other security to support amounts due 
management performs on going credit evaluations of its customers and bases the estimated allowance on these evaluations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market and have been reduced to the lower of cost or market for obsolete  excess or unmarketable inventory 
the lower of cost or market adjustment is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets intangible and certain other long lived assets with a definite life are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
the company does not amortize goodwill and reviews goodwill for impairment on a regular basis  at least annually 
management has reviewed goodwill and other intangibles for impairment and has concluded that such assets are appropriately valued at the financial statement date 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 

table of contents as of june   the company had provided a full valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize its deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
in the fourth quarter of  management determined that it was appropriate to release a substantial portion of the valuation allowance based upon the company s current and expected level of profitability  and the belief that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized before they expire 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  income taxes are required to be estimated 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our management estimates of taxable income and the period over which deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
chapter fas 
fas is applicable for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  fas requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling be recognized as current period charges rather than being included in inventory regardless of whether the costs meet the criterion of abnormal as defined in arb the company does not believe the adoption of fas will have any financial impact  since the company has historically expensed such costs as incurred

sfas no 
r will be effective for the company beginning july  as such  effective with the company s first fiscal quarter of fiscal  sfas no

the benefit for income taxes of million for fiscal resulted primarily from a current tax provision of million offset by the release of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of  as compared to income tax expense of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
historically  deferred tax assets arose from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  federal and state tax credit carryforwards and other timing differences 
these and other deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
the release of a substantial portion of the valuation allowance and the resulting recognition of a deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter was based on management s belief that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized due to current and expected profitability 
in making this determination  management considered all positive and negative factors 
to realize the tax benefit of these loss and credit carryforwards  the company expects to generate future taxable income of approximately million prior to the expiration of the carryforward amounts 
the remaining valuation allowance relates principally to the company s foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax rate for book purposes in fiscal will be approximately  even though the actual amount of cash taxes paid will be reduced by net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards and deductions due to stock option activities
