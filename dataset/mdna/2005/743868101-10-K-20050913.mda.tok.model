general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
provident savings bank  fsb  is a wholly owned subsidiary of provident financial holdings  inc and as such  comprises substantially all of the activity for provident financial holdings  inc certain matters in this annual report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements relate to  among others  expectations of the business environment in which the corporation operates  projections of future performance  perceived opportunities in the market  potential future credit experience  and statements regarding the corporation s mission and vision 
these forward looking statements are based upon current management expectations  and may  therefore  involve risks and uncertainties 
the corporation s actual results  performance  or achievements may differ materially from those suggested  expressed  or implied by forward looking statements due to a wide range of factors including  but not limited to  the credit risks of lending activities  including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loa n losses  the corporation s ability to access cost effective funding  the general business environment  the direction of future interest rates and the corporation s ability to successfully manage the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates  the california real estate market  competitive conditions between banks and non bank financial services providers  regulatory changes  labor market competitiveness  and other risks detailed in the corporation s reports filed with the sec 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the corporation s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the allowance is based on two principles of accounting i sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and can be estimated  and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  which require that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance has three components i a formula allowance for groups of homogeneous loans  ii a specific valuation allowance for identified problem loans and iii an unallocated allowance 
each of these components is based upon estimates that can change over time 
the formula allowance is based primarily on historical experience and as a result can differ from actual losses incurred in the future 
the history is reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made as needed 
various techniques are used to arrive at specific loss estimates  including historical loss information  discounted cash flows and fair market value of collateral 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
for further details  see the section entitled comparison of operating results for the year ended june  and provision for loan losses on page interest is generally not accrued on any loan when its contractual payments are more than days delinquent 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured 
a non accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms for a minimum six month period  and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  requires that derivatives of the corporation be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the bank s derivatives are primarily the result of its mortgage banking activities in the form of commitments to extend credit  commitments to sell loans and option contracts to mitigate the risk of the commitments 
estimates of the percentage of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale that may not fund are based upon historical data and current market trends 
the fair value adjustments of the derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations with offsets to other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the corporation adopted the sec guidance regarding loan commitments that are recognized as derivatives pursuant to sfas no 
as a result of implementing the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments  the corporation excludes the recognition of servicing released premiums in the valuation of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale 
the corporation s previous practice had been to recognize  at the inception of the rat e lock  the anticipated servicing released premiums on the underlying loans 
the corporation elected to prospectively apply this guidance to new loan commitments initiated after january  this action delays the recognition of servicing released premiums until the underlying loans are funded and sold 
executive summary and operating strategy provident savings bank  fsb established in is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid sized businesses in the inland empire region of southern california 
the bank conducts its business operations as provident bank  provident bank mortgage and through its subsidiary  provident financial corp 
the business activities of the corporation  primarily through the bank and its subsidiary  consist of community banking  mortgage banking  and to a lessor degree  investment services and real estate operations 
community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding its full service offices and investing those funds in single family  multi family  commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  consumer and other loans 
additionally  certain fees are collected from depositors for services provided to them such as  non sufficient fund fees  deposit account service charges  atm fees  ira keogh fees  safe deposit box fees  travelers check fees  and wire transfer fees  among others 
the primary source of income in community banking is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income produced by loans and securities  and the interest expense produced by interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
during the next three years the corporation intends to increase the community banking business by growing total assets  restructure the balance sheet by decreasing the percentage of investment securities to total assets and increasing the percentage of loans held for investment to total assets  decrease the concentration of single family mortgage loans within its loans held for investment  and increase the concentration of multi family  commercial real estate  construction and commercial business loans 
in addition  over time  the corporation also intends to decrease the percentage of time deposits in its deposit base and to increase the percentage of checking and savings accounts 
this strategy is intended to improve core revenue through a higher net interest margin and ultimately  coupled with the growth of the corporation  an increase in net interest income 
mortgage banking operations primarily consist of the origination and sale of mortgage loans secured by single family residences 
the primary sources of income in mortgage banking are gain on sale of loans and certain fees collected from borrowers in connection with the loan origination process 
during the next three years the corporation intends to concentrate on high margin mortgage banking products such as alt a fixed rate  alt a adjustable rate and second trust deed loans 
by doing so  the corporation believes that it can maintain its gain on sale margin at approximately the same levels experienced during each of the prior two years 
investment services primarily consists of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds to our depositors and real estate operations primarily consists of deriving net rental income from tenants that occupy the corporation s real estate held for investment 
each of these businesses generates a relatively small portion of the corporation s net income 
there are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the corporation  many of which are beyond the corporation s control  including general economic conditions  either nationally or locally  changes in interest rates  changes in real estate values  changes in accounting principles  changes in regulation  changes in deposit and funding flows  and changes in competition among financial institutions or non financial institutions  among others 
the corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices such as interest rate risk management  credit risk management  operational risk management  and liquidity management 
the current economic environment presents heightened risk for the corporation primarily with respect to rising short term interest rates and an increased concern that rising real estate values are unsustainable 
rising short term interest rates have led to a flatter yield curve placing pressure on the corporation s net interes t margin since the corporation s assets are generally priced at the intermediate or long end of the yield curve and interest bearing liabilities are generally priced at the short end of the yield curve 
rising real estate values may prove unsustainable which may lead to higher loan losses since the majority of our loans are secured by real estate located within california 
significant declines in california real estate may inhibit our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate 
commitments and derivative financial instruments the corporation conducts a portion of its operations in leased facilities under non cancelable agreements classified as operating leases see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report on form k for a schedule of minimum rental payments and lease expenses under such operating leases

off balance sheet financing arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the corporation s contractual obligations at june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the corporation s liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period year over to over to over in thousands or less years years years total operating lease obligations time deposits fhlb san francisco borrowings total the expected obligations for time deposits and fhlb san francisco borrowings include anticipated interest accruals based on respective contractual terms 
the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit  forward loan sale agreements to third parties and commitments to purchase investment securities 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition included in item of this report on form k 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss  in the event of non performance by the other party to these financial instruments  is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
as of june  and  these commitments were million and million  respectively 
comparison of financial condition at june  and june  total assets increased million  or  to billion at june  from billion at june  primarily as a result of increases in loans held for investment and receivable from sale of loans  partly offset by a decrease in investment securities 
the loans held for investment increased million  or  to billion at june  from million at june  primarily as a result of originating million of loans held for investment  which was partly offset by million of loan prepayments 
these prepayments were attributable to the continued high volume of refinance activity during fiscal in connection with a relatively low mortgage interest rate environment 
the receivable from sale of loans increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june   resulting from the timing difference between loan sales and loan sale settlements 
during fiscal  the bank originated approximately billion in new loans  primarily through pbm  and purchased million in loans from other financial institutions 
a total of billion of loans were sold during fiscal the pbm loan production is sold primarily servicing released 
the total loan origination volume was achieved as a result of better execution  favorable real estate market conditions and favorable mortgage interest rates 
the outstanding balance of loans held for sale decreased to million at june  from million at june  the outstanding balance of loans held for sale is largely dependent on the timing of loan fundings and loan sales 
total investment securities decreased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  for fiscal  issuers called million of investment securities  million of investment securities matured and million of reductions were the result of mortgage backed securities principal payments 
the principal reduction of mortgage backed securities was primarily attributable to mortgage prepayments and the normal principal payments of the underlying mortgage loans 
during fiscal  million of investment securities were purchased 
total liabilities increased million  or  to billion at june  from billion at june  as a result of increases in customer deposits and borrowings 
total deposits increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  although the bank continued its emphasis on expanding customer relationships  particularly in transaction accounts  increases in short term interest rates during fiscal became a catalyst for depositors to move their funds from savings accounts to time deposits to take advantage of higher yields 
transaction accounts decreased million  or  to million at june  from million  while checking accounts increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  time deposits increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  borrowings  comprised primarily of fhlb san francisco advances  increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  fhlb san francisco advances were primarily used to supplement the funding needs of the bank  to the extent that an increase in deposits and a decrease in investment securities did not meet loan funding requirements 
total stockholders equity was million at june   as compared to million at june  the million increase in stockholders equity during fiscal was primarily attributable to earnings in fiscal  partly offset by share repurchases and cash dividends to shareholders

the corporation had net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june   as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june  the increase in net income in fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in net interest income and non interest income  partly offset by an increase in non interest expense 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase resulted principally from an increase in average earning assets 
the average balance of earning assets increased million  or  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the net interest margin declined slightly to an average of in fiscal from an average of in fiscal interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily a result of increases in the average balance and the average yield of earning assets 
the increase in average assets was primarily attributable to the increase in loans held for investment  which was partly offset by the decrease in investment securities 
total originations of loans held for investment  including loan purchases  were million  while total loan prepayments were million in fiscal the increase in the average yield of earning assets was the result of increases in the average yield of investment securities  fhlb san francisco stock and federal funds investment during fiscal  which was partly offset by a decline in the average yield of loans receivable 
average yield on investment securities increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the average yield of investment securities was primarily due to lower amortization of premiums resulting from lower mbs principal prepayments 
the increase in the average yield of fhlb san francisco stock was due to the higher dividend received from fhlb san francisco 
the average yield on loans receivable decreased seven basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the average loan yield was primarily a result of the impact of the prepayment of higher yielding loans held for investment replaced with lower yielding loans 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was attributable to the increases in the average cost and average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the average cost of deposits increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the average cost of deposits was the result of the increase in short term interest rates during fiscal  maturities of lower costing time deposits and the change in the deposit mix toward higher costing time deposits 
the average balance of deposits increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the average cost of fhlb san francisco advances remained unchanged at in fiscal as compared to the average cost in fiscal the increase in long term interest rates for fhlb san francisco advances was offset by maturities of higher costing advances and the utilization of lower costing overnight borrowings 
the average maturity of fhlb san francisco advances decreased to months at june  from months at june  the average balance of fhlb san francisco advances increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal provision for loan losses 
loan loss provisions in fiscal were million as compared to  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily a result of the growth of loans held for investment in fiscal the loan growth in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal the allowance for loan losses was million  or of gross loans held for investment at june  as compared to million  or of gross loans held for investment at june  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans at the end of fiscal was  as compared to at the end of fiscal consistent with its current operating strategy  the corporation intends for the fastest growing segments of loans held for investment to be commercial real estate  multi family and construction loans 
these loans generally have greater risk than single family mortgage loans 
management believes that the current provision for loan losses is prudent based upon the loans held for investment composition  historic loss experience and current economic conditions 
as the risk profile of the corporation s loans held for investment changes  management may determine to increase the provision for loan losses 
non interest income 
total non interest income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in non interest income was primarily attributable to increases in gain on sale of loans and gain on sale of investment securities  partly offset by a decrease in loan servicing and other fees 
total gain on sale of loans increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and was the result of higher loan sale volume and a higher average loan sale margin at pbm 
total loans originated for sale increased million  or  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the average loan sale margin for pbm in fiscal was  up three basis points from in fiscal the loan sale margin at pbm is derived from total gain on sale of loans divided by total loan sale volume 
the pbm loan sale volume used to calculate the loan sale margin  which is defined as pbm loans originated for sale adjusted for the change in commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale  was billion in fiscal as compared to billion in fiscal the increase in the average loan sale margin was primarily attributable to the improvement in the product mix of the loan sales with a higher perce ntage of high margin products 
the high margin products consist primarily of second trust deeds  alt a adjustable rate and alt a fixed rate first trust deed mortgage loans 
in fiscal  the high margin products comprised of the pbm loan sale volume as compared to of the loan sale volume in fiscal the net impact of derivative financial instruments sfas no

the average profit margin for pbm in fiscal remained unchanged at basis points as compared to the same period in fiscal the average profit margin is defined as income before taxes divided by total loans funded during the period including brokered loans adjusted for the change in commitments to extend credit 
loan servicing and other fees decreased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  resulting primarily from lower servicing fees  lower commercial loan fees  lower returned check fees and lower late payment charges on loans

impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of the corporation s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all assets and liabilities of the corporation are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the corporation s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services 
impact of new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  that addresses accounting for changes in accounting principle  changes in accounting estimates  changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions and error correction 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle and error correction unless impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
states an exception to retrospective application when a change in accounting principle  or the method of applying it  may be inseparable from the effect of a change in accounting estimate 
when a change in principle is inseparable from a change in estimate  such as depreciation  amortization or depletion  the change to the financial statements is to be presented in a prospective manner

r  share based payment 
this statement supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance and is a revision of sfas no 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during wh ich an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
the revised accounting for stock based compensation requirements must be adopted by the corporation on july  sfas r allows for two alternative transition methods 
the corporation intends to follow the modified prospective method  which requires application of the new statement to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which th e requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the required effective date shall be recognized as the requisite services are rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost of that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
had the corporation adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact on net income and earnings per share would have been approximately similar to the pro forma net income and earnings per share as disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements

sop in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position no 
sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses the accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected from purchased loans or debt securities if those differences are attributable  in part  to credit quality 
sop requires purchased loans and debt securities to be recorded initially at fair value based on the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected with no carryover of any valuation allowance previously recognized by the seller 
interest income should be recognized based on the effective yield from the cash flows expected to be collected 
to the extent that the purchased loans or debt securities experience subsequent deterioration in credit quality  a valuation allowance would be established for any additional cash flows that are not expected to be received 
however  if more cash flows were subsequently expected to be received than originally estimated  the effective yield would be adjusted on a prospective basis 
sop was applied for loans and debt securities acquired after december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the corporation s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative aspects of market risk 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it purchase high risk derivative financial instruments 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
for information regarding the sensitivity to interest rate risk of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  see maturity of loans held for investment on page  investment securities activities on pages through  time deposits by maturities on page and interest rate risk on page qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and by selling fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
in addition  the bank maintains an investment portfolio  which is largely in us government sponsored enterprise securities and us government sponsored enterprise mbs with contractual maturities of up to years that reprice frequently 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of f unds 
management believes retail deposits  compared to brokered deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to five years

as part o f its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts 
using data from the bank s quarterly report to the ots  the ots produces a report for the bank that measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate risk analysis received from the ots is similar to the bank s own interest rate risk model 
npv is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the calculation is intended to illustrate the change in npv that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of    and basis points with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate change 
the following table is provided by the ots and sets forth as of june  the estimated changes in npv based on the indicated interest rate environments 
the bank s balance sheet position as of june  can be summarized as follows if interest rates increase by basis points  the npv of the bank is expected to increase  however  if interest rates decrease basis points  decrease basis points  increase basis points or increase basis points  the npv of the bank is expected to decrease 
npv as percentage net npv portfolio of portfolio value sensitivity basis points bp portfolio change value assets measure change in rates value assets dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp represents the decrease increase of the estimated npv at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the npv calculated at june  base case 
calculated as the estimated npv divided by the portfolio value of total assets 
calculated as the change in the npv ratio from the base case at the indicated change in interest rates 
the following table provided by the ots  is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the npv at a bp rate shock at june  and at a bp rate shock at june  by regulation the bank must measure and manage its interest rate risk for an interest rate shock of basis points  whichever produces the largest decline in npv 
at june  at june  risk measure bp bp rate shock bp bp pre shock npv ratio 
post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure bp bp as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals of time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the respective table 
it is also possible that  as a result of an interest rate increase  the increased mortg age payments required of arm borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in interest rates could also affect the volume and profitability of the bank s mortgage banking operations 
accordingly  the data presented in the tables above should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates 
furthermore  the npv presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the bank  nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to stockholders in the event of the liquidation of the corporation 
the bank also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the month period subsequent to any given month end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for the bank s current balance sheet  month business plan  embedded options  rate floors  periodic caps  lifetime caps  and loan  investment  deposit and borrowing cash flows  among others  and immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus or minus and basis points 
the following table describes the results of the analysis for june  and june  june  june  basis point bp change in basis point bp change in change in rates net interest income change in rates net interest income bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp in both of the fiscal year end periods described above  the bank is liability sensitive 
therefore  in a rising interest rate environment  the results project a decline in net interest income over the subsequent month period  and in a falling interest rate environment  the results project an increase in net interest income over the subsequent month period  except in the basis point scenario at june  where net interest income is also projected to decline 
management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable 
however  past experience has shown that immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur 
additionally  while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates  actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis 
therefore the model results that we disclose should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of our current disclosure to previous disclosures  over time  within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve
