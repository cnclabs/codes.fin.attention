item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
customers we currently provide retail services on a nationwide basis to retailers  manufacturers  and other companies including a number of fortune and multi national companies such as big lots  ch robinson  general electric  sony  union pacific  wal mart stores and whirlpool  which together represented approximately of our gross revenues  as well as numerous middle market companies 
other important customers include the scotts company  shaw industries  honda  owens corning  and sysco 
we have served many of our customers for over years 
our sales and customer service organizations  supported by our centralized pricing and logistics management systems  market our wholesale services primarily to intermodal marketing companies 
we also market our wholesale services to the automotive industry and ocean carriers 
through our sales network  and the sales networks of the intermodal marketing companies to which we sell wholesale services  we provide wholesale services to more than  shippers 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   there was no single customer that contributed more than of our total gross revenues 
sales and marketing as of december   our wholesale services were marketed by over sales and customer service representatives 
these representatives operate through seven regional and district sales offices and two regional service centers  which are situated in the major shipping locations across north america 
the sales representatives are directly responsible for managing the business relationship with channel partners such as intermodal marketing companies  logistics companies and steamship lines as well as supporting joint selling efforts directed at the owner of the freight 
in effect  our relationship with the intermodal marketing company s sales force enables us to market our wholesale services and directly and indirectly access shippers in major metropolitan areas throughout north america 
wholesale sales efforts support and influence the selling activities to achieve the mutually agreed upon volume and revenue goals of wholesale channel partners and customers 
the customer service representatives are responsible for supporting existing customers and sales representatives by providing cargo tracking services  resolving problems  and processing customer inquiries 
our wholesale efforts include a dedicated marketing function that drives our product development  strategic and tactical pricing  yield improvement  branding efforts and marketing communications 
as of december   our retail marketing and sales operations included over direct sales people and agents 
all of our sales people are supported by regional sales offices and sales managers located in los angeles and livermore california  chicago illinois  dublin ohio  memphis 
table of contents tennessee  atlanta georgia  dallas texas and rutherford new jersey 
our salaried sales representatives are deployed in major business centers throughout the country and target mid size and large customers 
our national network of commissioned sales agents provides additional geographic coverage and contributes additional business enabling us to achieve volume discounts and balance traffic flows 
both our salaried and commissioned sales forces are compensated by overall net revenue margin contribution to the company and therefore are incentivized to cross sell additional services to their customers 
each line of business has product specialists to support the general line sales force on specific cross sell opportunities 
in addition to our domestic sales force  we also have an extensive international network of sales and customer service representatives located in offices and agencies in over countries 
development of our company we commenced operations as an independent  stand alone company upon our recapitalization in may from until our recapitalization  our wholesale business was conducted by various entities owned directly or indirectly by apl limited 
in may  we were recapitalized through the purchase of shares of our common stock from apl limited by two affiliates of apollo management  and an affiliate of each of credit suisse first boston llc and deutsche bank securities inc from apl limited and our redemption of a portion of the remaining shares of common stock held by apl limited 
on the date of the recapitalization  we began providing retail and logistics services to customers through our acquisition of pacer logistics 
in connection with these transactions  our name was changed from apl land transport services  inc to pacer international  inc 
pacer logistics  inc was incorporated on march  and was the successor to a company formed in between the time of its formation and our acquisition of pacer logistics in may  pacer logistics acquired and integrated six logistics services companies 
in  we acquired four companies in the retail segment that have complemented our core retail business operations and expanded our geographic reach and service offerings for intermodal marketing  international freight forwarding and other logistics services 
in we integrated our core retail business operations into our pacer global logistics subsidiary 
in june  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  and used the net proceeds to repay a significant amount of our outstanding long term debt 
during june and july  we completed the refinancing of our credit facilities including the early redemption of million of senior subordinated notes issued in connection with our recapitalization 
in august  we completed an underwritten secondary public offering of common stock on behalf of certain selling stockholders 
there were no new shares issued and we received no proceeds from this offering 
in november  we completed the repricing of our senior credit facility 
on january   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement  providing for the issuance by the company of up to million in additional common stock  preferred stock and warrants to purchase any of such securities and for the sale by certain selling stockholders of  shares of common stock 
the registration statement was declared effective on january  there are currently no arrangements in place for the company to issue any additional securities 
on april  and november   we filed with the sec supplements to the prospectus included in the shelf registration statement discussed in the preceding paragraph for the sale by the selling stockholders named in the shelf registration statement of all  shares of the company s common stock in underwritten public offerings 
the april  offering was for  shares at per share and the november  offering was for  shares at per share  net to the selling shareholders 
there were no new shares issued in either offering and the company received no proceeds from the offerings 
including the january  registration statement  the company paid million of fees and expenses related to these offerings and charged the costs to the selling  general and administrative expense line item on the statement of operations 
upon completion of the november offering  apollo management and its affiliates no longer owned any shares of our common stock 

table of contents facilities equipment we lease space in an office building in concord  california for our wholesale segment and corporate headquarters and an office building in dublin  ohio for our retail segment headquarters 
our wholesale transportation network operates out of more than railroad terminals across north america 
our integrated rail network  combined with our leased equipment fleet  enables us to provide our customers with single company control over rail transportation to locations throughout north america 
substantially all of the terminals we use are owned and managed by rail or highway carriers 
however  we employ full time personnel on site at major locations to ensure close coordination of the services provided at the facilities 
in addition to these terminals  other locations throughout the eastern united states serve as stand alone container depots  where empty containers can be picked up or dropped off  or supply points  where empty containers can be picked up only 
in connection with our trucking services  agents provide marketing and sales  terminal facilities and driver recruiting  while an operations center provides  among other services  insurance  claims handling  safety compliance  credit  billing and collection and operating advances and payments to drivers and agents 
our wholesale equipment fleet consists of a large number of double stack railcars  containers and chassis that are owned or subject to short and long term leases 
we lease almost all of our containers  approximately of our chassis and approximately of our doublestack railcars 
in addition  all of our railcar equipment is associated with revenue generating arrangements 
our railcar fleet consists of free running railcars operating under the publicly reported mark bran 
these railcars are in general service with railroads throughout north america to haul not only our own intermodal containers but also those of the railroads and their other customers 
under this system  our railcars are freely interchanged from one rail carrier to another throughout the north american rail system 
to use our railcars  the rail carrier pays us a fee  known as the car hire rate  which takes into account the miles traveled by a railcar and the car s time in service with a railroad 
the actual rate payable is determined under our bilateral rate agreement with the railroad  or in the case of a railroad with which we have no rate agreement  under our schedule of car hire rates maintained in the car hire accounting rate master charm administered by railinc in association with the association of american railroads 
we are solely responsible for the costs of operating our railcars  and do not have any recourse to our customers for the lease or purchase of our railcars 
as of december   our wholesale stacktrain equipment fleet consisted of the following owned leased total containers containers containers total chassis and chassis chassis chassis total doublestack railcars during  we received  primarily ft 
leased containers and  primarily leased chassis and returned  primarily ft leased containers and  primarily leased chassis 
during 
table of contents  three railcars were destroyed 
at december   we had on order  ft 
containers with an option to order an additional  containers by march  all containers are expected to be delivered by the end of september in addition  at december   we had on order  ft 
chassis with an option to order an additional  chassis by may  all chassis are expected to be delivered by september  and will be financed through operating leases 
during  we received  primarily ft 
leased containers and  primarily leased chassis and returned  primarily ft leased containers and  primarily leased chassis 
during  five railcars were destroyed 
during  we received  leased containers and  leased chassis and returned  primarily ft leased containers and  leased chassis as part of a program to downsize this type of equipment 
leased railcars remained unchanged in we also own a limited amount of equipment to support our trucking operations 
the majority of our trucking operations are conducted through contracts with independent trucking companies that own and operate their own equipment 
we lease two warehouses in kansas city kansas and five facilities in los angeles california for dock space  warehousing and parking for tractors and trailers 
suppliers railroads we have long term contracts with our primary rail carriers  union pacific and csx  as well as tfm in mexico  and from time to time we maintain other operating arrangements with the other north american railroads  including canadian national railroad 
these contracts generally provide for access to terminals controlled by the railroads as well as support services related to our wholesale stacktrain operations 
through these contracts  our wholesale business has established a north american transportation network 
our retail business also maintains contracts with the railroads that govern the transportation services and payment terms pursuant to which the railroads handle intermodal shipments 
these contracts are typically of short duration  usually twelve month terms  and subject to renewal or extension 
we maintain close working relationships with all of the major railroads in the united states and will continue to focus our efforts on strengthening these relationships 
the rail contracts with union pacific and csx represent the substantial majority of our wholesale stacktrain division s cost of purchased transportation  while business with other railroads  including the canadian national railroad and tfm  represented approximately of our wholesale segment s cost of purchased transportation in through our contracts with these rail carriers  we have access to a  mile rail network throughout north america 
our rail contracts generally provide that the rail carriers will perform point to point  commonly referred to as linehaul  and terminal services for us 
pursuant to the service provisions  the rail carriers provide transportation of our intermodal equipment across their rail networks and terminal services related to loading and unloading of containers  equipment movement and general administration 
our rail contracts generally establish per container rates for stacktrain shipments made on rail carriers transportation networks and typically provide that we are obligated to transport a specified percentage of our total stacktrain shipments with each of the rail carriers subject to the rail carrier s achievement of certain service performance standards 
the terms of our rail contracts  including rates  are generally subject to adjustment or renegotiation throughout the term of the contract  based on factors such as the continuing fairness of the contract terms  prevailing market conditions and changes in the rail carriers costs to provide rail service 
based upon these provisions  and the volume of freight that we ship with each of the rail carriers  we believe that we enjoy competitive transportation rates for our stacktrain shipments 
agents and independent contractors we rely on the services of agents  who procure business for and manage a group of trucking contractors  and independent trucking contractors in long haul and local trucking services 
although we own a small number of tractors and trailers  the majority of our truck equipment and drivers are provided by agents and independent contractors 
our relationships with agents and independent contractors allow us 
table of contents to provide customers with a broad range of trucking services without the need to commit capital to acquire and maintain a large trucking fleet 
although our agreements with agents and independent contractors are typically long term in practice  they are generally terminable by either party on short notice 
agents and independent trucking contractors are compensated on the basis of mileage rates  fixed fees between particular origins and destinations  fixed fees within certain distance based zones or a fixed percentage of the revenue generated from the shipments they haul 
under the terms of our typical lease contracts  agents and independent contractors must pay all the expenses of operating their equipment  including driver wages and benefits  fuel  physical damage insurance  maintenance and debt service 
local trucking companies to support our rail brokerage operations  we have established a good working relationship with a large network of local truckers in many major urban centers throughout the united states 
the quality of these relationships helps ensure reliable pickups and deliveries  which is a major differentiating factor among intermodal marketing companies 
our strategy has been to concentrate business with a select group of local truckers in a particular urban area  which increases our economic value to the local truckers and in turn raises the quality of service that we receive 
risk management and insurance in our rail and truck brokerage operations  we typically require all motor carriers to which we tender freight to carry at least  in truckers commercial automobile liability insurance and  in cargo insurance 
many carriers provide insurance exceeding these minimums 
railroads  which are generally self insured  provide limited common carrier liability protection  generally up to  per shipment 
we maintain an all risk form of cargo insurance to protect us against cargo damage claims that may not be recoverable from the responsible carriers or their insurers 
in our operations as an authorized carrier or warehouseman  we maintain legal liability insurance to protect us against catastrophic claims arising from damage or loss to freight in transit or warehouse storage  or damage to our railcars and intermodal equipment 
our terms of carriage on international and ocean shipments limit our liability consistent with industry standards 
we offer our freight forwarding customers the option to purchase cargo insurance for their shipments 
we also carry commercial automobile liability insurance  truckers commercial automobile liability  commercial general liability  employers liability insurance  and umbrella and excess umbrella liability policies  with a total insurance limit of million 
our self funded retention deductible levels may vary based on claim frequency  severity and timing factors 
our current self retained level per incident for truckers commercial automobile liability is  until the aggregate value of claim payments per incident between  and  equals  at which time our per occurrence deductible reduces to  our current self retained level per incident for commercial general liability is  our current workers compensation and employers liability deductible is  per incident 
our current self funded retention deductible per incident for freight damage as an authorized carrier or warehouseman is  relationship with apl limited we have entered into a long term agreement with apl limited involving domestic transportation of apl limited s international freight by our wholesale stacktrain operation 
the majority of apl limited s imports to the united states are transported by rail from ports on the west coast to population centers in the midwest and northeast regions 
however  domestic intermodal freight that originates in the united states moves predominantly westbound from eastern and midwestern production centers to consumption centers on the west coast 
combining the typical westbound freight movement with the predominantly eastbound apl limited freight movement allows us to achieve higher train set utilization loads per train and higher eastbound westbound volumes  thereby improving our bargaining position with 
table of contents the railroads regarding contract terms 
in addition  we provide apl limited with equipment repositioning services through which we transport apl limited s empty containers from destinations within north america to their west coast points of origin 
to the extent we are able to fill these empty containers with the westbound freight of other wholesale customers  we receive compensation from both apl limited for our repositioning service on a cost reimbursement basis and from the other customers for shipment of their freight 
apl limited also supplies us with computer software and other information technology for our wholesale stacktrain business 
see information technology  above 
business cycle the transportation industry has historically performed cyclically as a result of economic recession  customers business cycles  increases in prices charged by third party carriers  interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors  many of which are beyond our control 
because we offer a variety of transportation modes and offer an economic intermodal product  we generally retain shipping volumes and benefit from increased use of our stacktrain services at the expense of long haul trucking competitors during down business cycles 
in periods of strong economic growth  demand for limited transportation resources  as has occurred over the past months  can result in increased rail network congestion and resulting operating inefficiencies 
although rail service deterioration increases our costs and may slow demand  we believe that our personnel on site at terminals  extensive equipment fleet and customer service capabilities enable us to provide comparatively better service than others affected by rail service deterioration and thereby to retain shipping volumes 
we also participate during periods of business expansion when speed of service to fill inventories increases in importance 
competition the transportation services industry is highly competitive 
our wholesale business competes primarily with over the road full truckload carriers  conventional intermodal movement of trailers on flatcars and containerized intermodal rail services offered directly by railroads 
our retail business competes primarily against other domestic non asset based transportation and logistics companies  asset based transportation and logistics companies  third party freight brokers  private shipping departments and freight forwarders 
we also compete with transportation services companies for the services of independent commission agents  and with trucklines for the services of independent contractors and drivers 
competition in our wholesale and retail business is based primarily on freight rates  quality of service  such as damage free shipments  on time delivery and consistent transit times  reliable pickup and delivery and scope of operations 
in the wholesale business  our major competitors include burlington northern santa fe  union pacific  csx intermodal and jb hunt transport 
our major competitors in the retail business include ch robinson  expeditors international  forwardair  uti worldwide  exel  alliance shippers  the supply chain solutions division of ryder  menlo logistics  egl  inc and hub group 
some of the competitors in the segments in which we operate  such as ch robinson  burlington northern santa fe and union pacific  have significantly larger operations and revenues than we do 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees 
none of our employees are represented by unions  and we generally consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory 
government regulation regulation of our trucking and intermodal operations the transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for  and cost of  providing transportation services 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on our business or results of operations 

table of contents our retail truck brokerage operations are licensed by the us department of transportation dot as a national freight broker in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle 
the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in our capacity as a national freight broker  including surety bonding requirements 
our truck services and local cartage operations provide motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with economic regulations administered by the dot  including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts 
other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 
although congress enacted legislation in that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight  we continue to be subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements 
we and the carriers upon which we rely in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations 
although compliance with regulations governing licenses in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past  there can be no assurance that these regulations or changes in these regulations will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
violations of these regulations could also subject us to fines or  in the event of serious violations  suspension or revocation of operating authority as well as increased claims liability 
intermodal operations like ours were exempted from virtually all active regulatory supervision by the us interstate commerce commission  predecessor to the regulatory responsibilities now held by the us surface transportation board 
such exemption is revocable by the surface transportation board  but the standards for revocation of regulatory exemptions issued by the interstate commerce commission or surface transportation board are high 
regulation of our international freight forwarding operations we maintain licenses issued by the us federal maritime commission as an ocean transportation intermediary 
our ocean transportation intermediary licenses govern both our operations as an ocean freight forwarder and as a non vessel operating common carrier 
the federal maritime commission has established qualifications for ocean transportation intermediaries  including surety bond requirements 
the federal maritime commission also is responsible for the regulation and oversight of non vessel operating common carriers that contract for space with vessel operating carriers and sell that space to commercial shippers and other non vessel operating common carriers for freight originating and or terminating in the united states 
non vessel operating common carriers are required to publish and maintain tariffs that establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states 
the federal maritime commission has the power to enforce these regulations by commencing enforcement proceedings seeking the assessment of penalties for violation of these regulations 
for ocean shipments not originating or terminating in the united states  the applicable regulations and licensing requirements typically are less stringent than in the united states 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and licensing requirements in all countries in which we transact business 
we are also licensed as a customs broker by the us customs and border protection service of the department of treasury in each united states customs district in which we do business 
all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the customs service 
in other jurisdictions in which we perform customs brokerage services  we are licensed  where necessary  by the appropriate governmental authority 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these requirements 
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our statements of operations 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we expect such disputes to continue to arise from time to time in the future 
we are currently involved in 
table of contents certain legal proceedings as discussed in item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
based on currently available information and advice of counsel  we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and that none of these items will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  our present assessment of the claims could change based on new information and future events 
in addition  even if successful  our defense against certain actions could be costly and could divert the time and resources of our management and staff 
environmental our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental  hazardous materials transportation and occupational health and safety requirements  including those relating to the handling  labeling  shipping and transportation of hazardous materials  discharges of substances into the air  water and land  the handling  storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties affected by pollutants 
in particular  a number of our facilities have underground and above ground tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products 
these facilities are subject to requirements regarding the storage of such products and the clean up of any leaks or spills 
we could also have liability as a responsible party for costs to clean up contamination at off site locations where we have sent  or arranged for the transport of  wastes 
we have not received any notices that we are potentially responsible for material clean up costs at any off site waste disposal location 
we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with environmental requirements nor do we believe that we have any material environmental liabilities 
we also do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in we cannot guarantee  however  that future changes in environmental requirements or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions will not have a material effect on our business 
seasonality our revenues generally show a seasonal pattern as some customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
in addition  the auto companies that we serve generally shut down their assembly plants for new model re tooling during the summer months 
risks related to our common stock because we have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts  a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable could be prevented 
provisions of our charter and bylaws or tennessee law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares in order to thwart a takeover attempt  a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of the board of directors  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  requiring super majority voting to effect particular amendments to our restated charter and amended bylaws  limitations on who may call special meetings of stockholders  
table of contents requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders unless the stockholders unanimously agree to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and prohibiting business combinations with interested stockholders unless particular conditions are met 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  the tennessee greenmail act and the tennessee control share acquisition act may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
risks related to our business we are dependent upon third parties for equipment and services essential to operate our business and if we fail to secure sufficient equipment or services  we could lose customers and revenues 
we are dependent upon transportation equipment such as chassis and containers and rail  truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third parties 
we  along with competitors in our industry  have experienced equipment shortages in the past  particularly during peak shipping season in october and november 
if we cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment or transportation services from these third parties to meet our customers needs  customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis  and as a result  our business  results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the trucking industry  including the local drayage community  is facing an ongoing shortage of drivers 
this shortage may cause our motor transportation suppliers to increase drivers compensation  thereby increasing our cost of providing motor transportation  including the local cartage portion of an intermodal move  to our customers 
accordingly  driver shortages could adversely impact our profitability and limit our ability to expand our intermodal and highway service offerings 
if we have difficulty attracting and retaining agents and independent contractors  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely extensively on the services of agents and independent contractors to provide our trucking services 
we rely on a fleet of vehicles which are owned and operated by independent trucking contractors and on agents representing groups of trucking contractors to transport customers goods by truck 
although we believe our relationships with our agents and independent contractors are good  we may not be able to maintain our relationships with them 
contracts with agents and independent contractors are  in most cases  terminable upon short notice by either party 
if an agent terminates its relationship with us  some customers and independent contractors with which such agent has a direct relationship may also terminate their relationship with us 
we may have trouble replacing our agents and independent contractors with equally qualified persons 
we compete with transportation service companies and trucking companies for the services of agents and with trucking companies for the services of independent contractors and drivers 
the pool of agents  contractors and drivers from which we draw is limited  and therefore competition from other transportation service companies and trucking companies has the effect of increasing the price we must pay to obtain their services 
the industry is currently experiencing a shortage of independent contractors resulting in increased compensation expenses to us and our competitors who also rely on them 
in addition  because independent contractors are not employees  they may not be as loyal to our company  requiring us to pay more to retain their services and to implement aggressive recruitment efforts to offset turnover 
if we are unable to attract or retain agents and independent contractors or need to increase the amount paid for their services  our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience difficulty increasing our business volume 

table of contents service instability in the intermodal industry could increase costs and decrease demand for our intermodal services 
we depend on the major railroads in the united states for substantially all of the intermodal transportation services we provide 
in many markets  rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad 
any reduction in service by the railroads with which we have relationships is likely to increase the cost of the rail based services we provide and reduce the reliability  timeliness and overall attractiveness of our rail based services 
for example  from to  service disruptions related to consolidation and restructuring in the railroad industry interrupted intermodal service throughout the united states 
during the past months  high demand for rail transportation  train resource shortages  severe weather and operating inefficiencies have resulted in increased transit times  terminal congestion and decreased equipment velocity 
while we believe that our customer service capabilities  extensive equipment fleet and network of personnel on site at terminals enables us to provide comparatively better service to our intermodal customers  rail service issues increase our costs and create a challenging operating environment 
to the extent that we operate on rail carriers that experience worse service performance  demand for our intermodal services may be adversely affected 
in addition  customers may switch to over the road carriers to avoid intermodal transportation delays 
although we have not been substantially adversely affected by past service disruptions resulting from rail industry consolidation and rail network congestion  we could be substantially affected by service disruptions in the future 
changes in freight rates  as a result of competition in our industry and pricing strategies of our transportation suppliers  could adversely affect our business 
the transportation services industry is highly competitive 
our retail businesses compete primarily against other domestic non asset based transportation and logistics companies  asset based transportation and logistics companies  third party freight brokers  shipping departments of our customers and other freight forwarders 
our wholesale business competes primarily with over the road full truckload carriers  conventional intermodal movement of trailers on flat cars  and containerized intermodal rail services offered directly by railroads 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do  which may allow them to better withstand an economic downturn  reduce their prices more easily than we can or expand or enhance the marketing of their products 
there are a number of large companies competing in one or more segments of our industry  although the number of companies with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited 
depending on the location of the customer and the scope of services requested  we must compete against both the niche players and larger entities 
in addition  customers are increasingly soliciting competitive bids for transportation services from a number of competitors  including competitors that are larger than we are 
we also face competition from internet based freight exchanges  or electronic bid environments  which attempt to provide an online marketplace for buying and selling supply chain services 
historically  competition has created downward pressure on freight rates 
in the past  we have experienced downward pressure in the pricing of our wholesale and retail services that has affected our revenues and operating results 
in particular  our wholesale segment  has offered lower rates to its customers to match lower rates offered by our railroad competitors in the intermodal business 
such rate reductions could adversely affect the yields of our intermodal product 
rate increases  particularly when taken by our railroad and highway transportation suppliers  may also have an adverse impact if our brokerage operations are unable to obtain commensurate price increases from our customers 
for example  during  due to increased demand  all the major rail carriers instituted price increases 
although the application of rate increases to our wholesale stacktrain business is limited by our long term contracts with the railroads  such increases have resulted in higher costs to our retail rail brokerage operation that it has not been able to fully pass on as quickly as the increases are implemented by the rail carriers 
while our wholesale stacktrain operation may benefit from the intermodal rate increases  such rate increases may have the impact of slowing overall demand for intermodal services and thereby affecting our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents our customers who are also competitors could transfer their business to their non competitors which would decrease our profitability 
as a result of our company operating in two distinct but related intermodal segments  we buy and sell transportation services from and to many companies with which we compete 
for example  hub group  gst corp and alliance shippers  three of the largest customers of our wholesale operations  who accounted for of the revenues of our wholesale operations  are also competitors of our retail operations 
it is possible that these customers could transfer their business away from us to other companies with which they do not compete 
the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our wholesale operations 
in addition  rather than outsourcing their transportation logistics requirements to us  some of our customers could decide to provide these services internally which could further adversely affect our business volumes and revenues 
our revenues could be reduced by the loss of major customers 
we have derived  and believe we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from our largest customers 
in  union pacific accounted for approximately of our gross revenues and our largest customers accounted for approximately of our gross revenues 
the loss of one or more of our major customers or a significant change in their shipping patterns could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  business and prospects 
work stoppages or other disruptions affecting the transportation network could adversely affect our operating results 
as transportation services are provided through a network of rail and trucking transportation providers  a disruption in one area or in one sector can affect the fluidity of the entire network 
in addition  because the railroads workforce is generally subject to collective bargaining agreements  our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes between the railroads and their union employees 
our business could also be adversely affected by a work stoppage at one or more railroads or affecting providers of local trucking services from rail terminals 
for instance  during late april and early may  independent owner operators providing drayage services in lathrop  oakland and other northern california areas refused to transport shipments to and from the rail facilities 
this led to congestion at the rail facilities  which caused the union pacific railroad to issue an embargo on shipments to northern california destinations 
also on april   owner operators in the los angeles area refused to haul shipments 
our local cartage operations in northern california and the los angeles were directly and adversely impacted by their owner operators refusal to haul freight  and the cartage service interruption has also aggravated rail service issues in northern california where a substantial number of stacktrain s shipments originate or terminate 
although the work stoppage was ended quickly and our relations with our owner operators appear to have stabilized  the work disruption did adversely affect our results of operations in the second quarter of we have also experienced service disruptions due to other conditions  such as adverse weather or an act of terrorism or war  that hinder the railroads and local trucking companies ability to provide transportation services 
during and early  hurricanes in florida and alabama and severe storms in nevada and california have resulted in the railroads embargoing shipments to geographic areas and rail lines affected by these weather events 
work stoppages affecting seaports and railroads may also adversely impact our operations 
on september  during our fiscal fourth quarter  west coast ports were shut down as a result of a labor dispute with the longshoremen who offload freight that we subsequently transport 
on october   the ports were reopened as a result of a court order implementing provisions of the taft hartley act 
third party international loadings and repositioning revenue from our wholesale segment were adversely impacted during the shutdown of the ports 
in addition  railcar utilization declined during the shutdown impacting railcar revenues 
the shutdown also impacted our local cartage and harbor drayage on the west coast with lower volumes and our retail segment international freight forwarding operations were impacted due to reduced ship sailings 
this service disruption ended in january when a new six year contract was agreed to by the international longshore and warehouse union and the pacific maritime association 
work stoppages  slowdowns or other disruptions  such as resulting from an act of terrorism or war in the future  are beyond our reasonable control and such events  particularly if they have a material effect on 
table of contents major railroad interchange facilities or areas through which significant amounts of our rail shipments pass  such as the los angeles and chicago gateways  could adversely affect our operating income and cash flows in both our wholesale and retail segments 
if we fail to develop  integrate  upgrade or replace our information technology systems  we may lose orders and customers or incur costs beyond our expectations 
increasingly  we compete for customers based upon the flexibility and sophistication of our technologies supporting our services 
the failure of the hardware or software that supports our information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems  or our customers inability to access or interact with our website  could significantly disrupt our operations  prevent our customers from placing orders  or cause us to lose orders or customers 
if our information technology systems are unable to handle additional volume for our operations as our business and scope of services grow  our service levels  operating efficiency and future freight volumes will decline 
in addition  we expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated  fully integrated information systems from their supply chain management service providers 
if we fail to hire qualified personnel to implement and maintain our information technology systems or fail to upgrade or replace our information technology systems to handle increased volumes  meet the demands of our customers and protect against disruptions of our operations  we may lose orders and customers that could seriously harm our business 
during  we settled our arbitration with an unrelated third party developer seeking damages for the developer s failure to complete a contract to develop a stand alone information technology system to replace apl limited s computer system used by our stacktrain operations 
while the arbitration was pending  the developer ceased doing business and made a general assignment of its assets for the benefit of its creditors under california law 
under the settlement agreement  we took delivery from the assignee and a third party escrow agent of all of the partially completed software code that had been developed by the developer under the original contract 
with the assistance of independent consultants  we are evaluating the extent of the software development work that had been performed by the developer and the feasibility of completing the development of the software and placing it into service 
we have capitalized an aggregate of million for the acquisition and development of software in connection with this conversion project  including million paid to the third party developer involved in the arbitration 
while we believe that it is probable that software being developed for internal use will be completed and placed in service  if facts and circumstances change which would indicate that it is no longer probable that the computer software under development will be completed and placed in service  we may need to recognize an impairment of the previously capitalized software 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could adversely affect our earnings 
we are exposed to claims related to property damage  personal injury  cargo loss and damage and workers compensation 
we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers 
the cost of such insurance has risen significantly  reflective of the insurance environment in our industry and our claim experience 
to offset  in part  the significant cost increases we have experienced  we have elected to increase our self insured retention deductible levels for our public liability risk exposures 
our current deductible per incident for truckers commercial automobile liability is  until the aggregate value of claim payments per incident between  and  equals  at which time our per occurrence deductible reduces to  our current deductible level per incident for commercial general liability is  our current workers compensation and employers liability deductible is  per incident 
our current deductible per incident for freight damage as an authorized carrier or warehouseman is  we also are responsible for legal expenses within our deductible retentions for liability and workers compensation claims 
we currently reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and regularly evaluate and adjust our claim reserves to reflect actual experience 
if the ultimate results differ from our estimates  we could suffer losses above reserved amounts 
to cover losses in excess of our self insured retention  we maintain insurance with insurance carriers that we believe are financially sound 
although we believe our aggregate insurance limits are sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims  it is possible that one or more claims could exceed those limits 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment  our operating results would be adversely affected 

table of contents as we expand our services internationally  we may become subject to international economic and political risks 
a portion of our business is providing services internationally 
international revenues accounted for approximately of our gross revenues in compared to in and doing business outside the united states subjects us to various risks  including changing economic and political conditions  major work stoppages  exchange controls  currency fluctuations  armed conflicts and unexpected changes in united states and foreign laws relating to tariffs  trade restrictions  transportation regulations  foreign investments and taxation 
significant expansion in foreign countries will expose us to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles 
we have no control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and  therefore  unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these changes 
we have an extensive relationship with our former parent  apl limited  and we depend on apl limited for essential services 
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if apl limited failed or refused to provide such services or terminated the relationship 
pursuant to long term contracts  apl limited  the former owner of our wholesale stacktrain services business  supplies us with chassis from its equipment fleet for the transport of international freight on behalf of other international shippers 
in addition  we transport apl limited s international cargo on our stacktrain network to locations in the united states using the chassis and equipment supplied by apl limited 
the additional wholesale volume attributable to the transport of apl limited s international cargo contributes to our ability to obtain favorable provisions in our rail contracts 
apl limited pays us a fee for repositioning its empty containers within north america so that the containers can be reused in trans pacific shipping operations 
in addition  apl limited is currently providing us with computers  software and other information technology necessary for the operation of our wholesale stacktrain business 
if any of our contracts with apl limited were terminated or if apl limited were unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations to us under the terms of these contracts  our business  results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
if we lose key personnel and qualified technical staff  our ability to manage the day to day aspects of our business will be weakened 
we believe that the attraction and retention of qualified personnel is critical to our success 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel  our ability to manage the day to day aspects of our business will be weakened 
our operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance of our senior management team 
the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team  particularly donald c 
orris  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we face significant competition in the attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skill sets that we seek 
because our senior management team  particularly mr 
orris  has unique experience with our company and within the transportation industry  it would be difficult to replace them without adversely affecting our business operations 
in addition to their unique experience  our management team has fostered key relationships with our suppliers 
such relationships are especially important in a non asset based company such as ours 
loss of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
if we fail to comply with or lose any required licenses  governmental regulators could assess penalties against us or issue a cease and desist order against our operations which are not in compliance 
our retail truck brokerage operation is licensed by the dot as a broker in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle 
the dot has established requirements for acting in this capacity  including insurance and surety bond requirements 
our truck services and local cartage operations are regulated as motor carriers by the dot and various state agencies  subjecting these operations to insurance  surety bond  safety and other regulatory requirements 
our international freight forwarding operation is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary by the us federal maritime commission 
the federal maritime commission regulates ocean freight forwarders and non vessel 
table of contents operating common carriers like us that contract for space with the actual vessel operator and sell that space to commercial shippers and other non vessel operating common carriers for freight originating and or terminating in the united states 
non vessel operating common carriers must publish and maintain tariffs for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states 
the federal maritime commission may enforce these regulations by instituting proceedings seeking the assessment of penalties for violations of these regulations 
for ocean shipments not originating or terminating in the united states  the applicable regulations and licensing requirements typically are less stringent than in the united states 
our international freight forwarding operation is also licensed  regulated and subject to periodic audit as a customs broker by the customs service of the department of treasury in each united states customs district in which we do business 
in other jurisdictions in which we perform customs brokerage services  we are licensed  where necessary  by the appropriate governmental authority 
our failure to comply with the laws and regulations of any of these governmental regulators  and any resultant suspension or loss of our licenses  could result in penalties or a cease and desist order against any operations that are not in compliance 
such an occurrence would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we  our suppliers and our customers are subject to changes in government regulation which could result in additional costs and thereby affect our results of operations 
the transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes that can affect its economics 
although we primarily operate in the intermodal segment of the transportation industry  which has been essentially deregulated  changes in the levels of regulatory activity in the intermodal segment could potentially affect us and our suppliers and customers 
our trucking operations and those of the trucking companies and independent contractors we engage are subject to regulation by the dot and various state and local agencies  which govern such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  and insurance requirements 
as an example  on january   revised dot hours of service regulations became effective 
these revised regulations reduced the amount of time that drivers can spend driving  if shippers are unwilling to assist in managing the drivers non driving activities  such as loading  unloading  and waiting 
they may also affect the ability to make timely deliveries 
in response to the new regulations  our trucking operations  among other responsive actions  began efforts to obtain reduced free times and higher accessorial charges from customers for driver waiting services 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision rejecting the revised hours of service rules based on concerns regarding driver health as well as other issues such as driving time  rest periods and monitoring compliance 
on september   congress passed a law that allowed the new regulations to remain in effect until the dot issues new regulations or september   whichever is earlier 
since the new regulations have gone into effect  we have endeavored to make appropriate pricing  operational and training adjustments to address the new regulations and mitigate their impact on our results of operations 
while difficult to quantify  we believe that the new rules have negatively impacted our operating results due to the slight productivity decreases experienced by our drivers 
as the industry continues to implement the new regulations and in connection with the issuance of additional new rules in  we will endeavor to make appropriate adjustments in response 
however  if these changes increase the amounts charged by the trucking companies and independent contractors we engage to provide transportation to our customers and we cannot pass the additional costs through to our customers  our operating results could continue to be adversely affected 
future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices  influence the demand for transportation services or require the outlay of significant additional costs 
for instance  regulations imposing heightened security measures on transportation providers beyond those imposed since could slow the movement of freight through us and foreign ports  across borders or within north america and thus could adversely affect our business 
additional expenditures incurred by us  or by our suppliers  who would pass the costs onto us through higher prices  would adversely affect our results of operation 
in addition  we have a substantial number of wholesale customers who provide ocean carriage of intermodal shipments 
these wholesale customers as well as our international freight forwarding operations are subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission  us customs and by other international  foreign  federal and state authorities 
regulatory changes in the ocean shipping or international freight forwarding industries could affect our freight forwarding operations or have a material impact on the competitiveness and or efficiency of operations of our various ocean carrier customers  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents in addition  as a publicly traded company  we are also affected by changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules 
our efforts to comply with these evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations requiring that we present our management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
during  we paid auditors and consultants approximately million pre tax per diluted share after tax related to this effort 
in addition to the time and expense  these changing laws  regulations and standards impose other risks 
for instance  while we have been able to determine in that our internal controls are effective  failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  may prevent us and our auditors from concluding in the future that our internal controls are effective 
such a conclusion that our internal controls are not effective could adversely impact our reputation with investors and our stock price 
our operating results are subject to cyclical fluctuations and our quarterly revenues may also fluctuate  potentially affecting our stock price 
historically  sectors of the transportation industry have been cyclical as a result of economic recession  customers business cycles  increases in prices charged by third party carriers  interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors such as changes in fuel costs over which we have no control 
increased operating expenses incurred by third party carriers can be expected to result in higher costs to us  and our net revenues and income from operations could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of increased transportation costs 
we have a large number of customers in the automotive and consumer goods industries 
if these customers experience cyclical movements in their business activity  due to an economic downturn  work stoppages or other factors over which we have no control  the volume of freight shipped by those customers may decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected 
any unexpected reduction in revenues for a particular quarter could cause our quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or stockholders 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
if the markets in which we operate do not grow  our business could be adversely affected 
the failure of the transportation and logistics industries and their segments  including the third party logistics market  to continue to grow may have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock 
if we make future acquisitions  they may be financed in a way that reduces our reported earnings or imposes additional restrictions on our business 
if we make future acquisitions  we may issue shares of capital stock that dilute other stockholders  incur debt  assume significant liabilities or create additional expenses related to intangible assets  any of which might reduce our reported earnings or reduce earnings per share and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  any financing that we might need for future acquisitions may be available to us only on terms that restrict our business 
our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities 
as of december   we have significantly reduced our long term debt to million 
we have the ability to incur new debt  subject to limitations in our credit agreement 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us  including the following payments on our indebtedness will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and future business opportunities  
table of contents a substantial decrease in our net operating cash flows could inhibit our ability to meet our debt service requirements and force us to modify our operations  we may be more highly leveraged than our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  our debt level may make us more vulnerable than our competitors to a downturn in our business or the economy generally  our debt level reduces our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms  and all of our debt has a variable rate of interest  which increases our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations 
we may not have sufficient cash to service our indebtedness 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon  among other things our future financial and operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  and the future availability of borrowings under our new credit facility or any successor facility  the availability of which may depend on  among other things  our complying with certain covenants 
if our operating results and borrowings under our credit facility are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness  we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances and or capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection 
there is no assurance that we can effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms  or at all 
our debt agreements contain operating and financial restrictions which may restrict our business and financing activities 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit agreement and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
in addition  our credit agreement restricts our ability to declare dividends  redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or purchase debt  incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions  make loans and investments  incur additional indebtedness  amend or otherwise change debt and other material agreements  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates  and change our primary business 
our credit facility also requires us to satisfy interest coverage and leverage ratios 
a breach of any of the restrictions  covenants  ratios or tests in our debt agreements could result in defaults under these agreements 
a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable 
we might not have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
in addition  our obligations under our credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 

table of contents a determination by regulators that our independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs 
from time to time  tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees  rather than independent contractors 
in the future these authorities could be successful in asserting this position  or the interpretations and tax laws that consider these persons independent contractors could change 
if our independent contractors are determined to be our employees  that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax  worker s compensation  unemployment benefits  labor  employment and tort laws  as well as our potential liability for employee benefits 
our business model assumes that our independent contractors are not deemed to be our employees  and exposure to any of the above increased costs would impair our competitiveness in the industry 
if we are unable to identify  make and successfully integrate acquisitions  our profitability could be adversely affected 
identifying  acquiring and integrating businesses requires substantial management  financial and other resources and may pose risks with respect to customer service and market share 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
these risks include unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations and technologies  the need to manage a significantly larger and more geographically dispersed business  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  diversion of management s attention from ongoing development of our business or other business concerns  potential loss of customers  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  and the use of substantial amounts of our available cash 
we have acquired a number of businesses in the past and  although we are not presently considering any significant acquisitions  we may consider acquiring businesses in the future that provide complementary services to those we currently provide or expand our geographic presence 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or be able to acquire them on reasonable terms or at all  and a failure to do so could limit our ability to expand our business 
while we believe that we have sufficient financial and management resources and experience to successfully conduct our acquisition activities and integrate the acquired businesses into our operations  our acquisition activities involve more difficult integration issues than those of many other companies because the value of the companies we acquire comes mostly from their business relationships  rather than their tangible assets 
the integration of business relationships poses more of a risk than the integration of tangible assets because relationships may suddenly weaken or terminate  or key personnel responsible for those relationship may depart 
further  logistics businesses we have acquired and may acquire in the future compete with many customers of our wholesale stacktrain operations  and these customers may shift their business elsewhere if they believe our retail operations receive favorable treatment from our wholesale stacktrain operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate business that we have acquired in the past or any business that we may acquire in the future  we could experience difficulties with customers  personnel or others  and our acquisitions might not enhance our competitive position  business or financial prospects 

table of contents item legal proceedings the company is party to various legal proceedings  claims and assessments arising in the normal course of its business activities 
however  management believes none of these items will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
two of our subsidiaries engaged in local cartage and harbor drayage operations  interstate consolidation  inc  which was subsequently merged into pacer cartage  inc  and intermodal container service  inc  were named defendants in a class action filed in july in the state of california  los angeles superior court  central district the albillo case  alleging  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty  unfair business practices  conversion and money had and received in connection with monies including insurance premium costs allegedly wrongfully deducted from truck drivers earnings 
the plaintiffs and defendants entered into a judge pro tempore submission agreement in october  pursuant to which they waived their rights to a jury trial  stipulated to a certified class  and agreed to a minimum judgment of  and a maximum judgment of million 
in august  the trial court ruled in our favor on all issues except one  namely that in our subsidiaries failed to issue to the owner operators new certificates of insurance disclosing a change in our subsidiaries liability insurance retention amount  and ordered that restitution of  be paid for this omission 
plaintiffs counsel then appealed all issues except one the independent contractor status of the drivers  and our subsidiaries appealed the insurance retention disclosure issue 
in december  the appellate court affirmed the trial court s decision as to all but one issue  reversed the trial court s decision that the owner operators could be charged for the workers compensation insurance coverage that they elected to obtain through our subsidiaries  and remanded back to the trial court the question of whether the collection of workers compensation insurance charges from the owner operators violated california s business and professions code and  if so  to determine an appropriate remedy 
we sought review at the california supreme court of this workers compensation issue  and the plaintiffs sought review only of whether our subsidiaries providing insurance for the owner operators constituted engaging in the insurance business without a license under california law 
in march  the supreme court of california denied both parties petitions for appeal  thus ending all further appellate review 
as a result  the only remaining issue is whether our subsidiaries collection of workers compensation insurance charges from the owner operators violated california s business and professions code and  if so  what restitution  if any  should be paid to the owner operator class 
the schedule for this new trial  which will be litigated in the same trial court that heard the original case  was set in the fourth quarter of at the court s request  the parties will submit the evidence in the form of briefs  affidavits and other documents on a specific briefing schedule the court has established  as opposed to convening a full evidentiary trial 
we expect the court will issue its holding sometime in the first half of the same law firm prosecuting the albillo case has filed a separate class action lawsuit in the same jurisdiction on behalf of a putative class of owner operators the renteria class action who are purportedly not included in the albillo class 
the claims in the renteria case  which is being stayed pending full and final disposition of the remaining issue in albillo  mirror those in albillo  specifically  that our subsidiaries providing insurance for their owner operators constitutes engaging in the insurance business without a license in violation of california law and that charging the putative class of owner operators in renteria for workers compensation insurance that they elected to obtain through our subsidiaries violated california s business and professions code 
we believe that the final disposition of the insurance issue in albillo in the company s favor precludes the plaintiffs from re litigating this issue in renteria 
based on the final ruling in albillo on the insurance issue and other information presently available  and in light of our legal and other defenses on the insurance issue and the workers compensation related claim  management does not expect these legal proceedings to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
our wholly owned subsidiary  pacific motor transport company d b a pacer transport  was a defendant in a personal injury action in upshur county  east texas  dicks v 
pacific motor transport company  which arose out of a motor vehicle incident 
the jury found pacer transport liable and awarded damages to the plaintiff in the amount of  including pre and post judgment interest and court costs  the total amount of the judgment is approximately  at present 

table of contents at trial  the jury did not find any negligence on the part of the plaintiff  who was riding in an elevated position in the back of a speeding pickup truck and was thrown from the bed when the pick up truck allegedly swerved to avoid pacer transport s truck as it pulled out into the roadway 
the trial judge refused to set aside the jury s finding that the plaintiff himself was not negligent in any way 
we contend that this finding was incorrect under well settled law in texas in circumstances where a plaintiff s own conduct contributes to or causes his own accident and injuries 
we appealed to the texas court of appeals which earlier this year refused to reverse the trial court 
we then appealed to the texas supreme court 
the supreme court has ordered a full briefing of the appeal 
we expect the briefing to be completed during the first quarter of following the submission of briefs  the supreme court may either accept the appeal and hold oral arguments or deny the appeal in its entirety 
if the supreme court denies our appeal  the full amount of the dicks judgment  plus interest and costs  will become due and payable 
currently the unreserved portion of this possible loss is approximately  we instituted a related case  pacific motor transport company v 
lockton companies  inc  lockton risk services  inc  and cambridge integrated services group  inc  in which we seek to hold an insurance broker  the insurer s managing general agent  and a claims administrator responsible for our losses in the dicks case due to their mishandling of our claim for insurance coverage 
at the time of the incident  we maintained a comprehensive insurance program consisting of primary insurance and excess insurance 
the primary insurance policy applicable to the dicks claim was subject to a  deductible 
we provided all required notices of the dicks claim and litigation to the insurer through its authorized representatives 
nevertheless  at the conclusion of the dicks trial  the insurer s agent reserved rights and refused to acknowledge any responsibility for losses above  we then sued the insurer  the various lockton entities and cambridge 
the insurer was then placed into receivership in pennsylvania and has since gone out of business  and therefore has been removed from the case 
we are still pursuing the case against the lockton entities and cambridge for violations of the texas insurance code  negligent misrepresentation  and other claims  in which we seek to recover all of the losses  costs and damages arising out of the lockton entities and cambridge s conduct in mishandling our insurance claim for the dicks incident 
the lockton case is currently scheduled to go to trial in july item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading non asset based north american third party logistics provider offering a broad array of services to facilitate the movement of freight from origin to destination 
we operate in two segments  the wholesale segment and the retail segment see note to the consolidated financial statements for segment information 
our wholesale segment provides intermodal rail transportation and local cartage services primarily to intermodal marketing companies  large automotive intermediaries and international shipping companies 
our retail segment provides truck brokerage and truck services  intermodal marketing services  warehousing and distribution  international freight forwarding and supply chain management services primarily to shippers 
executive summary this year proved to be a very challenging year for pacer 
we have been through rail service problems  temporary embargoes  ramp closures and severe weather during and have still been able to improve overall operating results 
our results for improved over and  primarily as a result of strength in our wholesale segment operations 
since our ipo on june   we have been able to increase gross revenues  income from operations  net income and earnings per share each year as shown in the table below 
in addition  since december   we have reduced our long term debt by million to a total of million at december  using a combination of stock offering proceeds and cash flows from operations 
we reduced our long term debt by million in alone  and plan to continue to repay debt with our future operating cash flows 
our interest expense has declined dramatically over the last few years  as shown in the table below  and is expected to be approximately million in  assuming no significant increases in interest rates 
in millions  except per share amounts gross revenues income from operations 
interest expense net income diluted eps for  our wholesale stacktrain operations continued to be the strength of the company  contributing million of income from operations for the year 
that strength came from all wholesale lines of business  domestic volumes  up in compared to  automotive volumes  up in compared to  and international volumes  up in compared to our cartage operations contributed million of income from operations for with positive results from almost all operating locations 
overall  our retail segment did not improve results in compared to due to the performance of our rail brokerage and warehousing and distribution units 
however  four of the six units that comprise our retail segment did improve revenues and income from operations by a combined million and million  respectively in compared to revenues and income from operations for our rail brokerage and warehousing and distribution units decreased in compared to we believe we have solved the warehousing and distribution situation primarily by eliminating the temporary warehousing facilities and reducing our freight handling costs through improved warehouse management 
our rail brokerage unit lost approximately million of revenue and almost million of margin due to two large retailers changing shipping patterns in we have initiated and continue to implement a number of efforts to improve rail brokerage performance  including reengineering financial and operational processes to drive cost reductions and improve service  hiring an experienced sales management team  reorganizing the retail sales group to seven regions from four  giving more proximity to customers  and enhancing our business development  yield and pricing functions 
while the results of our rail brokerage operation have not achieved management s desired goals  it still provides significant traffic volumes to our wholesale stacktrain and cartage operations 

table of contents our tax loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were fully used in  and resulted in our tax payments increasing in to million from million in each of the prior two years 
we expect tax payments to be approximately million in compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires this report to include management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditor s report on that assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control  was a major focus for the company during in order to effectively document and test our controls over financial reporting we engaged the services of outside consultants to assist our employees in accomplishing that task 
in addition  our external auditors have spent significant time in reviewing and testing our control structure over financial reporting 
we paid to auditors and consultants in approximately million pre tax per diluted share after tax related to this effort 
we expect that external costs for continued compliance will be approximately million annually 
on january  the us department of transportation implemented new hours of service rules that limit the amount of time truck drivers can spend driving before a rest is required 
in response to a court decision questioning the new rules  us department of transportation may further adjust the hours of service rules in while difficult to quantify  we believe that the new rules have negatively impacted our operating results due to the slight productivity decreases experienced by our drivers 
in  we plan to continue our focused sales and marketing programs to take advantage of the continually increasing intermodal volumes industrywide  and look forward to improved retail segment results  especially from our rail brokerage and warehousing and distribution units 
due to customer turnover in these two retail segment units  most of the improvement will occur in the second half of the year 
for our wholesale segment  we have seen some customers and ocean carriers shift import traffic to other west coast ports in an effort to avoid congestion in the los angeles basin 
we expect to take advantage of this in through our facilities in oakland and seattle 
during  our stacktrain division increased our container fleet by from  and we will continue to increase our equipment fleet during as necessary to handle intermodal volumes 
on the information technology front  we have outsourced the technical support function help desk for our system users to an independent third party and look for improved service and reduced costs in we plan on implementing a new operating system in started in for our cartage operation that will support future growth and ensure better service to customers 
our stacktrain operation expects to implement a new container reservation system in to ensure that customers have access to the equipment needed 
overall gross margins in are expected to remain flat at approximately 
the gross margin for our stacktrain operations is expected to decline slightly due primarily to changes in business mix 
we plan to continue to take selective rate increases where feasible 
our retail segment gross margin is expected to increase due to margin improvement initiatives and business mix 
our base line capital budget in is approximately million and includes projects for growth and capacity  business improvement  security and business protection and replacement 
capital expenditures in will be funded by operating cash flows 
actual results may differ materially from the estimates  expectations and projections described above 
some of the factors that could affect these estimates and expectations are described above under the caption risks related to our business and special note regarding forward looking statements 
key objectives in addition to the traditional financial measures for managing our operations  we also use a key objective management process designed to improve execution of objectives deemed to be substantive to our financial results 
these key objectives are aimed at focusing management attention at specific problem areas or opportunities for improvement 
for the critical key objectives  the defined objective  along with 
table of contents the activity completed  problems encountered  and future action steps to be taken  are reviewed by top management on a monthly basis 
for  we managed a total of key objectives covering both operating segments and have planned approximately key objectives for the key objectives were aimed at increasing business growth  improving margins and profitability and improving or maintaining safety in our transportation businesses 
a few of the key objectives are described below 
a key objective of our rail brokerage unit in was to minimize the cost of purchased transportation 
this was to be achieved through rate reductions or rate increase avoidance from underlying carriers and taking advantage of quick pay discounts 
activities for this objective include reviewing drayage costs for selected origin destination pairs and finding a lower cost vendor and identifying and investigating opportunities for quick pay discounts 
the goal for was to save million in purchased transportation cost 
the rail brokerage unit achieved a measured savings cost avoidance in of million 
our rail brokerage unit also had a related price improvement key objective aimed at increasing margins by either selected rate increases or reduction of transportation costs 
activities accomplished for this objective during included reviewing linehaul rates for customers with low or negative margins  reviewing customer accounts that have cost increases without corresponding rate increases and identifying customer routings with low returns 
the goal of the program was to increase the overall rail brokerage margin by million for the unit achieved measured increases in margin of million during the year 
billing and collection of accessorial charges has been a problem area because many customers frequently do not recognize that they have received the service  become frustrated with the separate billing for these items  and therefore refuse to pay 
accessorial charges are additional charges from the underlying equipment transportation providers for work outside the primary scope of moving freight 
these charges include fuel surcharges and per diem charges for holding equipment for longer than an agreed upon term  among others 
a key objective for our rail brokerage unit was to convert the billing of accessorial charges to one of four preferred methods that would simplify the multiple billings to a customer for each accessorial activity and improve bill collections 
the target for was to bill of all accessorial charges through one of the four preferred methods to simplify the process and to increase the net accessorial margin by million 
for  of accessorial billings were issued using one of the preferred methods of billing and the net accessorial margin improved by million 
improving contribution margin was a key objective for our truck brokerage unit in the focus of this objective was to identify low margin traffic lanes or customers in order to find alternatives to increase rates and or reduce transportation costs 
activities for this objective included the development of margin reports by customer  identifying low margin customers and high cost vendors and coordinating with transportation purchasing or sales personnel to rectify 
a total of million in improved margin was achieved by the truck brokerage unit in through this objective versus a goal of million 
our cartage unit implemented during enhancements to its safety program by terminal to reduce the number of accidents and related expense as measured by a reduction in an accident ratio per driver accidents drivers and a driver at fault accident ratio per driver 
activities during the year for this objective included driver training classes conducted at locations to increase the level of awareness and training of our owner operators to prevent accidents  injuries and related costs  providing security kits for trucks  auditing driver logs  inspecting trucks for safety and implementation of a driver safety award program 
the accident ratio achieved in exceeded the key objective goal of improving the accident ratio in during we also achieved our goal of maintaining the same driver at fault ratio achieved for our truck services unit also has a related safety performance improvement objective focused on reducing accidents and related expense 
many of the same safety activities described above for our cartage unit were also accomplished by truck services 
while our ultimate objective is to have no recordable accidents  the goal for the truck services unit under our key objective process was to achieve a 
table of contents department of transportation safestat score of less than and a recordable accident frequency of less than accidents per million miles 
the unit significantly exceeded both of these goals 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
recognition of revenue we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we maintain signed contracts with our customers and have bills of lading specifying shipment details including the rates charged for our services 
our stacktrain operation recognizes revenue for loads that are in transit at the end of an accounting period on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue is recorded for the portion of the transit that has been completed because reasonably dependable estimates of the transit status of loads is available in our computer systems 
in addition  our stacktrain operation offers volume discounts based on annual volume thresholds 
we estimate our customers annual shipments throughout the year and record a reduction to revenue accordingly 
should our customers annual volume vary significantly from our estimates  a revision to revenue for volume discounts would be required 
during  our total volume discounts were million 
our wholesale cartage operations and our retail segment recognize revenue after services have been completed 
the following table illustrates volume discounts as a percentage of wholesale segment gross revenues for  and in millions  except percents wholesale segment gross revenues total volume discounts volume discounts as a percentage of wholesale segment gross revenues based on our results for the fiscal year ended december   a basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in gross revenues of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates the potential effect that a basis point deviation from our estimates would have had on our consolidated financial results and is not intended to provide an estimated range of exposure or expected deviation in millions  except per share data basis points management s estimate basis points total volume discounts income from operations net income diluted earnings per share recognition of cost of purchased transportation and services both our wholesale and retail segments estimate the cost of purchased transportation and services and accrue an amount on a load by load basis in a manner that is consistent with revenue recognition 
in addition  our retail segment may earn discounts to the cost of purchased 
table of contents transportation and services that are primarily based on the annual volume of loads transported over major railroads 
we estimate our annual volume throughout the year and record a reduction to cost of purchased transportation accordingly 
should our annual volume vary significantly from our estimates  a revision to the cost of purchased transportation would be required 
total discounts earned for were million 
the following table illustrates volume discounts earned as a percentage of retail segment cost of purchased transportation and services for  and in millions  except percents retail segment cost of purchased transportation and services total volume discounts earned volume discounts as a percentage of retail segment cost of purchased transportation and services based on our results for the fiscal year ended december   a basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of approximately million

estimates are used in determining this allowance based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the following table illustrates the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross revenues for  and in millions  except percents gross revenues allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross revenues historically  our actual losses have been within the estimated allowances 
however  unexpected or significant future events or changes in trends could result in a material impact to future results of operations 
based on our results for the fiscal year ended december   a percent deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates the potential effect that a percent deviation from our estimates would have had on our consolidated financial results and is not intended to provide an estimated range of exposure or expected deviation in millions  except per share data percent management s estimate percent allowance for doubtful accounts income from operations net income diluted earnings per share 
table of contents deferred tax assets at december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million and have not recorded a valuation reserve as we believe that future earnings will more likely than not be sufficient to fully utilize the assets 
the minimum amount of future taxable income required to realize this asset is million 
should we not be able to generate this future income  we would be required to record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our statement of operations 
goodwill at december   we had recorded million of net goodwill 
the carrying amount of goodwill at december  assigned to our wholesale and retail segments was million and million  respectively 
during  our local cartage operations were moved to the wholesale segment 
as a result  million of related net goodwill was reclassified 
we adopted the financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective december  and ceased to amortize goodwill on that date 
goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to periodic tests  at least annually  for impairment and recognition of impairment losses in the future could be required based on the methodology for measuring impairments described below 
sfas requires a two step method for determining goodwill impairments where step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
we determine the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the first fiscal quarter of  did not result in an impairment charge 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for our wholesale and retail segments as of december   the annual testing date  was approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value for our wholesale and retail segments of approximately million and million  respectively 
use of non gaap financial measures from time to time in press releases regarding quarterly earnings  presentations and other communications  we may provide information about the company s ebitda or other financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is presented because it is commonly used by investors to analyze and compare operating performance 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of a company s profitability 
other non gaap financial measures may exclude the costs of our debt refinancing  senior subordinated note redemption and secondary offering in  the costs of our ipo in or other costs 
management uses these non gaap measures in its analysis of the company s performance 
management believes that presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of our core businesses and allows investors to more easily compare operating results from period to period 

table of contents background our wholesale segment s stacktrain operations fiscal year ends on the last friday in december and the wholesale segment s local cartage operations fiscal year and our retail segment s fiscal year end on the last day in december 
the following section describes some of our revenue and expense categories and is provided to facilitate investors understanding of the discussion of our historical financial results  including these revenue and expense items  discussed under the caption results of operation 
gross revenues the wholesale segment s gross revenues from stacktrain operations are generated through rates  fuel surcharges and other fees charged to customers for the transportation of freight utilizing the rail transportation services that we purchase from rail carriers under our long term and other operating agreements with north american railroads 
the growth of these revenues is primarily driven by increases in volume of freight shipped  as overall rates other than fuel surcharges have historically remained relatively constant 
however  the recent surge in demand for rail transportation has led the rail carriers and our stacktrain operation to increase rates for certain services 
the average rate is impacted by product mix  rail routes utilized  fuel surcharge and market conditions 
also included in gross revenues are railcar rental income  container per diem charges and incentives paid by apl limited and others for the repositioning of empty containers with domestic westbound loads 
gross revenues are reported net of volume discounts provided to customers 
our wholesale stacktrain operation generally generates revenues from three lines of business international shipments tendered by ocean shipping companies  automotive shipments tendered by intermediaries arranging transportation for automotive manufacturers and parts suppliers and third party domestic shipments tendered by intermodal marketing companies for shippers within north america 
growth in the wholesale segment s gross revenues from local cartage operations  which primarily support our stacktrain operations and intermodal marketing companies including our rail brokerage unit through the use of independent owner operators  is driven primarily by increased volume as well as length of haul and the rate per mile charged to the customer 
the retail segment s gross revenues are generated through rates and other fees charged for our portfolio of freight transportation services  including truck brokerage and truck services  intermodal marketing services  warehousing and distribution  international freight forwarding and supply chain management services 
overall growth in gross revenues for the retail segment is driven by expanding our service offerings and marketing our broad array of transportation services to our existing customer base and to new customers 
growth in gross revenues from truck brokerage is driven primarily through increased volume and outsourcing by companies of their transportation and logistics needs 
growth in gross revenues from truck services operations which primarily provide specialized transportation services to customers through independent contractors and owner operators  is driven primarily by increased volume as well as length of haul and the rate per mile charged to the customer 
intermodal marketing involves arranging the movement of freight in containers and trailers utilizing truck and rail transportation 
increases in gross revenues from intermodal marketing are generated primarily from increased volumes  as rates are dependent upon product mix and route  which tend to remain relatively constant as customers shipments tend to remain in similar routes 
increases in gross revenues for warehousing and distribution  which includes the handling  consolidation deconsolidation and storage of freight on behalf of the shipper  are driven by increased outsourcing and import volumes and by increased use of third party containers  rather than their own  by shipping lines on the west coast to move freight inland 
through our supply chain management services  we manage all aspects of the supply chain from inbound sourcing and delivery logistics through outbound shipment  handling  consolidation  deconsolidation  distribution  and just in time delivery of end products to our customers customers 
revenues for supply chain management services are recognized on a net basis and increases are driven by increased outsourcing 
we also provide international freight forwarding services  which involves arranging transportation and other services necessary to move our customers freight to and from a foreign country 
increases in gross revenues for international freight forwarding are driven by the globalization of trade 

table of contents cost of purchased transportation and services the wholesale segment s cost of purchased transportation and related services consists primarily of the amounts charged to us by railroads and local trucking companies under our contracts with these carriers 
in addition  terminal and cargo handling services represent the variable expenses directly associated with handling freight at a terminal location 
the cost of these services is variable in nature and is based on the volume of freight shipped 
the retail segment s cost of purchased transportation and related services consists of amounts paid to third parties under our contracts with them to provide such services  such as railroads  independent contractor truck drivers  freight terminal operators and dock workers 
third party rail costs are charged through contracts with the railroads and are dependent upon product mix and traffic lanes 
sub contracted or independent operators are paid on a percentage of revenues  mileage or a fixed fee from point to point or between zones 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses are both fixed and variable expenses directly relating to our stacktrain operations and consist of equipment lease expense  equipment maintenance and repair costs  fixed terminal and cargo handling expenses and other direct variable expenses 
our fleet of leased equipment is financed through a variety of short and long term leases 
increases to our equipment fleet will primarily be through additional leases as the growth of our business dictates 
equipment maintenance and repair costs consist of the costs related to the upkeep of the equipment fleet  which can be considered semi variable in nature  as a certain amount relates to the annual preventative maintenance costs in addition to amounts driven by fleet usage 
fixed terminal and cargo handling costs primarily relate to the fixed rent and storage expense charged to us by terminal operators and is expected to remain relatively fixed 
selling  general and administrative expenses the wholesale segment s selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs of customer acquisition  billing  customer service  salaries and related expenses of the executive and administrative staff  office expenses and professional fees and includes the million annual fee currently paid to apl limited for information technology services under a long term agreement of which million is subject to a compounded annual increase since may 
the retail segment s selling  general and administrative expenses relate to the costs of customer acquisition  billing  customer service and salaries and related expenses of marketing  as well as the executive and administrative staff s compensation  office expenses and professional fees 
the retail segment anticipates that it will incur increased overall selling related costs as it grows its operations  but that such costs will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenues 
the costs related to corporate functions  such as administration  finance  legal  human resources and facilities will likely increase as the business grows  but will likely decrease as a percentage of net revenues as the business grows

table of contents gross revenues 
gross revenues increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  gross revenues in our retail segment increased million reflecting increases in our truck services  international and truck brokerage businesses 
this was partially offset by year over year revenue decreases in our warehousing and distribution and rail brokerage units 
the truck services year over year increase in revenues of was due primarily to the addition of two new agents and also an increase in the amount of freight brokered due to high demand for transportation 
our international unit s revenues increased due primarily to increased import business with the far east 
the truck brokerage increase of was due primarily to increases in the lower margin automotive business 
our warehousing and distribution unit experienced a decrease in year over year revenues due to customer turnover as well as to the strategic elimination of temporary warehousing facilities 
revenues in our rail brokerage unit decreased reflecting changed shipping patterns for two large retailers that we could not overcome with added business 
in addition  our rail brokerage unit was impacted by capacity related service issues with our core rail carriers during the year 
wholesale segment gross revenues increased million  reflecting a million increase in stacktrain revenues as well as a million increase in cartage revenues  from almost all cartage locations 
stacktrain results reflected increases in all wholesale lines of business including domestic  international and automotive even though saw service issues with our core rail carriers and short term embargoes and ramp closures at selected locations due to inclement weather 
the increase in wholesale domestic operations was a result of increased freight revenues from several intermodal marketing companies 
domestic containers handled increased over and the average revenue per container increased due primarily to the increase in the fuel surcharge that was between and during compared to between and during the increase in fuel surcharge reflects the increase in fuel costs as discussed below under the heading cost of purchased transportation and services 
the wholesale international operations increase in freight revenues was primarily the result of increased business from two international shipping companies 
international container volumes were above wholesale automotive volumes were above with increases from daimlerchrysler and general motors 
contributing to the overall increase in stacktrain gross revenues were higher repositioning revenue associated with higher domestic volumes and increased container per diem revenue that resulted from more containers in service during and to improved billing and collection efforts 
overall containers handled increased from the prior year 
it should be noted that approximately million of the wholesale segment increase in revenues for compared to was due to an extra week in our fiscal year compared to our retail segment s usage of our wholesale segment for rail transportation decreased by million  or  in compared to reflecting reduced rail brokerage shipments including the shifting of some shipments to maximize certain rail incentives 
cross selling activities within the retail segment increased by million in compared to  and activities within the wholesale segment increased by million during our program to increase inter and intra segment generated revenues is continuing and is focused on coordinating capacity within and between segments so that future growth can occur without degrading our ability to satisfy customer requirements 
cost of purchased transportation and services 
cost of purchased transportation and services increased million  or  for compared to the cost of purchased transportation and services in our retail segment increased million due primarily to the increased business discussed above 
much of the increase in business discussed above is lower margin business 
the overall gross margin percentage on our retail business has declined from in to in our rail brokerage division has not been able to pass all rail transportation cost increases on to customers due to the competitive situation  which reduces the margin on retained business 
our warehousing and distribution division lost a large profitable customer in late which has impacted margins negatively in this division  and also incurred costs related to vacating temporary warehousing facilities which added to the decline in retail segment gross margin 
the increased revenue for our truck brokerage division was due primarily to low margin automotive shipments  and the increase in the international unit s import business also contributed to the overall decline in retail segment gross margin 

table of contents the wholesale segment s cost of purchased transportation and services increased million for compared to reflecting increases in both stacktrain and cartage costs 
the stacktrain increase was related to the increased shipments noted above combined with a slight increase in the cost per container due primarily to increased fuel costs and changes in business mix 
approximately million of the stacktrain increase was due to the extra week in the fiscal year 
the cartage increase was also due primarily to increased shipments noted above coupled with the newer cartage locations added in late or early the overall gross margin for the wholesale segment has increased to in from in direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  which are only incurred by our wholesale stacktrain operations  increased million  or  in compared to due primarily to increased container and chassis lease costs attributable to the higher fleet size during partially offsetting the increase were reduced equipment maintenance expenditures 
at december   we had or  more containers and or  more chassis than at december  approximately million of the increase was due to the extra week in stacktrain s fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to primarily as the result of increased compensation expense associated with an overall average increase of people employed during compared to and an increase in professional fees compared to this was partially offset by reduced temporary warehouse rental expense in our retail segment 
the headcount increase was associated primarily with additional trucking locations added since as well as additional sales personnel 
the increase in corporate costs primarily professional fees related to general increases in audit and tax fees  costs associated with complying with the sarbanes oxley act of  and costs related to the preparation of a shelf registration statement filed with the sec on january  and two supplements to the shelf registration statement prospectus filed with the sec on april  and november  during  million was incurred related to secondary stock offering costs 
in addition  corporate costs included increased legal fees associated with certain litigation 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  for compared to as a result of property retirements in both the wholesale and retail segments and property becoming fully depreciated 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  from million in to million in wholesale segment income from operations increased million reflecting a million increase in stacktrain income from operations approximately million from the extra week in fiscal and a million increase in cartage income from operations 
the stacktrain increase was due to strength in all three wholesale lines of business as well as increased container per diem charges related to more containers in service during and to improved per diem charge billing and collection procedures 
the cartage increase was due to increased business at almost all locations 
the wholesale segment increase in income from operations was partially offset by a million decrease in income from operations in compared to in our retail segment 
the retail segment decrease reflected reduced business in our rail brokerage and warehousing and distribution divisions due to customer turnover 
rail brokerage operations were also adversely impacted by capacity related rail service issues with our core rail carriers during and the inability to pass through cost increases from underlying service providers 
income from operations was adversely impacted by corporate costs related to audit and tax fees  costs associated with complying with the sarbanes oxley act of  preparation of the shelf registration statement and two supplements to the shelf registration statement prospectus and legal fees 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  for compared to due primarily to a lower level of outstanding debt during at december   total long term debt was million  million less than the balance of million at december  loss on extinguishment of debt 
on june   we completed the refinancing of our existing term loan and revolving credit facility  and on july  we completed the redemption of our million senior subordinated notes  all with funds provided by a new senior credit facility see

table of contents gross revenues 
gross revenues increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  gross revenues in our retail segment decreased million reflecting reductions primarily in our rail and truck brokerage operations and our truck services operations 
this was partially offset by year over year revenue increases in our warehousing and distribution division due to the addition of a new customer  our international freight forwarding unit due to strong government overseas relief shipments and our supply chain services division due to the addition of a new customer 
while we experienced volume and revenue increases from many of our rail brokerage customers  these increases were offset due to the curtailment by the federal government of its policy of allowing amtrak trains to handle a given amount of freight traffic  which resulted in reduced shipments from one large customer in particular 
our truck brokerage operations also experienced increased shipments from many customers  but not of a sufficient amount to equal or exceed the increased fourth quarter shipments due to the west coast port strike in october wholesale segment gross revenues increased million  reflecting a million increase in stacktrain revenues as well as a million increase in cartage revenues that resulted primarily from additional trucking locations in compared to stacktrain results reflected increases in wholesale automotive and third party domestic operations partially offset by a decrease in wholesale international operations 
automotive volumes increased for compared to the increase in wholesale third party domestic operations was a result of increased freight revenues from several intermodal marketing companies 
domestic containers handled increased over the wholesale international operations decrease in freight revenues was primarily the result of the loss of low margin shipments from an international shipping customer during the first quarter of international container volumes were below contributing to the overall increase in stacktrain gross revenues were higher repositioning revenue associated with higher domestic volumes and a to fuel surcharge in effect during compared to a to fuel surcharge in that went into effect during the second quarter of overall containers handled increased from the prior year 
our retail segment s usage of our wholesale segment for rail transportation decreased by million  or  in compared to cross selling activities within the retail segment itself increased by million in compared to our program to increase inter and intra segment generated revenues is continuing and is focused on coordinating capacity within and between segments so that future growth can occur without degrading our ability to satisfy customer requirements 
cost of purchased transportation and services 
cost of purchased transportation and services increased million  or  for compared to cost of purchased transportation and services in our retail segment decreased million reflecting the revenue reduction noted above 
contributing to this decline was a change in estimation on linehaul expenses 
the retail segment overall gross margin remained constant at approximately in both years resulting from a higher fuel surcharge in effect during and improved yield management  which were offset by changes in business mix and the change in estimation on linehaul expenses 
the wholesale segment s cost of purchased transportation and services increased million for compared to  reflecting increases in both stacktrain and cartage costs 
the stacktrain increase was related to the increased shipments noted above partially offset by a slight decline in the cost per container due primarily to changes in business mix 
the cartage increase was also due primarily to increased shipments noted above coupled with the newer cartage locations added in late or early the overall gross margin increased to in from in these increases were due to improved yield management  the higher fuel surcharge and reduced low margin international shipping volumes 
the gross margin on cartage operations declined to in from in due primarily to the lower margin on the new trucking locations added in compared to direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  which are only incurred by our wholesale stacktrain operations  increased million  or  in compared to due to increased costs related to railcar maintenance as railcars acquired in enter a normal repair cycle coupled with increased container off hire costs associated with returning older containers 
partially offsetting these increased costs were lower chassis lease costs resulting from the december elimination of the chassis sublet from apl limited 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to primarily as the result of increased compensation associated with an overall average increase of people employed during compared to and an increase in insurance costs compared to the headcount increase was associated with the new customer in our supply chain services division and the additional local cartage locations added in corporate costs also increased in due to million of costs associated with the secondary stock offering in and proceeds from a legal settlement that reduced costs in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  for compared to as a result of property retirements in both the wholesale and retail segments and property becoming fully depreciated 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in income from operations is a result of the increase in net revenues and gross margin percentages described above 
wholesale segment income from operations increased million reflecting a million increase in stacktrain income from operations partially offset by a million decrease in local cartage income from operations 
the stacktrain increase was due to the strength in wholesale automotive and third party domestic operations 
the cartage decrease resulted from a higher employment level and start up costs in the growing cartage operations and increases in accruals for insurance costs during retail segment income from operations decreased million due primarily to reduced shipments in our rail and truck brokerage and truck services operations coupled with a change in estimation on linehaul expenses 
income from operations was adversely affected by million of increased corporate costs for insurance  the million cost for the secondary offering of common stock 
in addition  costs in were reduced by proceeds from a non recurring legal settlement 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  for compared to due to a lower level of outstanding debt and lower interest rates during in june  we completed our initial public offering of common stock and repaid million of our variable interest rate bank debt 
at december  total long term debt was million  million less than the balance of million at december loss on extinguishment of debt 
on june   we completed the refinancing of our existing term loan and revolving credit facility  and on july  we completed the redemption of our million senior subordinated notes  all with funds provided by a new senior credit facility see discussion under liquidity and capital resources below

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was due primarily to the increase in accounts receivable and increased cash payments for taxes partially offset by improved operating results and reduced interest costs for as compared to the increase in accounts receivable was due to an increase in average daily sales compared to coupled with a seasonal increase in the days sales outstanding due to slow payment during the holiday season 
the increase was primarily in current accounts receivable that were received after our fiscal year end

interest paid was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense for is expected to be approximately million 
cash generated by operating cash flows in is projected to be between million and million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was due primarily to improved operating results for the year coupled with reduced interest costs 
interest costs are lower due to the repayment of debt with proceeds of our june ipo and reduced interest rates due to our june and july refinancing and redemption of the senior subordinated notes  and debt payments in in november  we completed the repricing of our senior credit facility  which further reduced the interest rates under our new senior credit facility 
cash generated from operating activities is typically used for working capital purposes  to fund capital expenditures  to repay debt and for acquisitions 
we utilize a revolving credit facility in lieu of maintaining large cash reserves 
we believe that it is better to reduce debt and minimize our interest liability than to maintain cash balances and incur increased interest expense 
we had working capital of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the slight increase in was due primarily to the increase in receivables at the end of the increase was seasonal due to increased revenues and days sales outstanding 

table of contents our operating cash flows are also the primary source for funding our contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes as of december   our major commitments in millions 
contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases equipment obligation capital leases volume incentives management agreement apl information systems agreement technical support agreement purchased transportation total our total long term debt as refinanced  see below was originally incurred to finance our recapitalization  the acquisition of pacer logistics and the four acquisitions in our retail segment in cash interest expense on long term debt was estimated using current rates for all periods based upon required repayments 
the majority of the operating lease requirements relate to our wholesale segment s lease of railcars  containers and chassis 
in addition  each year a portion of the operating leases requires renewal or can be terminated based upon equipment requirements 
partially offsetting these lease payment requirements are railcar and container per diem revenues not reflected in the table above which were million in  million in and million in the equipment obligation is our estimate of operating lease payments on  foot containers and  foot chassis ordered  but yet to be financed 
we anticipate financing the equipment through an operating lease 
volume incentives relate to amounts payable to companies that ship on our stacktrain division and have met certain volume shipping commitments for the year our management agreement with apollo management  lp expired at the end of the  is our last payment to be made 
our stacktrain operations use apl limited s computer systems under a long term contract that may be terminated by us by giving days notice 
the technical support agreement reflects the costs of outsourcing our computer help desk function in the purchased transportation amount reflects our estimate of the cost of transportation purchased by our segments that is in process at year end but not yet completed and minimum container commitments to ocean carriers made by our non vessel operating common carrier operation 
based upon the current level of operations and the anticipated future growth in both operating segments  management believes that operating cash flow and availability under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
our revolving credit facility matures in june due to our voluntary debt repayments during the year  our next required debt payment is march  cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the use of cash in includes million for the new cartage operating system with the remaining amounts for normal computer system replacement items 
this was partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property 
the use of cash in included million for trailers at the truck services division of our retail segment with the remaining expenditures for normal computer system replacement items 
these amounts were partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property 
the use of cash in was for capital expenditures of million partially offset by million of proceeds for the sale of retired equipment 
capital expenditures included million for the conversion from apl limited s computer systems to a stand alone capability for our wholesale segment  million for the expansion of the rail van computer systems to handle our retail segment operating requirements and million for computer replacements  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 

table of contents in march  we commenced plans for the conversion from apl limited s computer systems to a stand alone capability based on information technology systems currently available in the marketplace from unrelated third parties 
at december   an aggregate of million had been paid to such third parties for the acquisition and development of software in connection with the conversion project  which has been capitalized in property and equipment under sop this amount includes million paid to a third party developer under a fixed price development contract discussed below 
during the third quarter of  and in connection with this conversion  we engaged in the negotiation of proposed contract modifications requested by the developer that  if accepted and agreed to  would have extended the completion of the development work through the end of at an increased cost to us 
since we were unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the developer  during the fourth quarter of we instituted arbitration under the contract seeking damages for the developer s failure to complete the contract and other claims 
the developer answered by denying liability and asserting a counter claim against us for failing to continue to make progress payments following the developer s breach of the contract 
we denied liability on the developer s counter claim and any obligation to continue to make payments to the developer 
on april   the developer and its corporate affiliates completed a general assignment for the benefit of creditors under california law 
under this assignment  the developer and its corporate affiliates transferred ownership of all of their rights in tangible and intangible assets  including the developer s claims in the arbitration proceeding we commenced  to a third party assignee for purposes of liquidating such assets  winding down the developer and its corporate affiliates  and distributing the net liquidation proceeds to creditors 
as a result of this assignment and the related liquidation proceedings  the assignee retained control over the partially completed software code created by the developer under the original contract  thus preventing us from utilizing it in connection with the conversion project 
while the separate arbitration and liquidation proceedings have been pending  however  we have been utilizing the system design work performed by the developer under the original contract 
in july  we entered into an agreement with the assignee settling all claims between us and the developer asserted in the arbitration and otherwise arising under the original contract 
under the settlement agreement  we received a cash payment of approximately  out of the assets of the developer that remained available for distribution to unsecured creditors  and we exchanged mutual releases of all claims asserted in the arbitration and otherwise arising under the original contract 
in addition  pursuant to the settlement agreement we took delivery from the assignee and a third party escrow agent of all of the partially completed software code that had been developed by the developer under the original contract 
with the assistance of independent consultants  we are evaluating the extent of the software development work that had been performed by the developer and the feasibility of completing the development of the software and placing it into service 
during this evaluation and further work on the conversion project  we are and will continue to avail ourselves of the services and support under our existing long term agreement with apl limited 
we believe that it is probable that software being developed for internal use will be completed and placed in service  as we have the ability and intention to complete this software project 
however  in the event facts and circumstances change  whether as a result of our evaluation of the software or otherwise  which would indicate that it is no longer probable that the computer software under development will be completed and placed in service  we would evaluate the previously capitalized software for impairment 
capital expenditures for are budgeted at million and include the remaining amounts for the cartage operating system to enhance labor efficiencies and cost savings efforts and support our long term growth strategy

table of contents loan facility due june   with an original principal amount of million  and a five year million revolving credit facility due june  on june   we drew million of a delayed draw term loan facility and repaid the million outstanding balance on the existing term loan facility  million of fees and expenses and million of interest due at closing 
the remaining million of the delayed draw term loan facility was drawn on july  to redeem the million senior subordinated notes and to pay interest through the redemption date and the million redemption premium 
in addition to the refinancing amounts discussed above  during  we repaid a net million of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
on november  we negotiated a repricing for the delayed draw seven year term loan 
the repricing resulted in an immediate reduction of of to the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is subject to further reductions based upon the company achieving certain financial ratios 
the seven year term loan portion of the senior secured credit facility bears interest at a base rate plus a per annum margin or at a eurodollar rate plus a per annum margin  at our option 
the revolving loan facility portion of the senior secured credit facility bears interest at a base rate plus per annum margin or at a eurodollar rate plus per annum margin  at our option
