overview we are a designer and manufacturer of power supplies for oems 
our advanced power supply products are typically custom designed into mid to high end commercial applications in the computing and storage  wireless infrastructure  enterprise networking  medical and industrial markets 
we operate worldwide and have facilities in orange county  california  bombay  india  guadalajara  mexico  and wavre  belgium 
we were founded in in orange county  california 
as we expanded our business and customer base  we opened facilities in bombay  india and in guadalajara  mexico 
in june  we acquired cherokee europe  which added a manufacturing facility in wavre  belgium and enabled us to better serve the european market 
we generate a significant portion of our sales from oems in the communications and computing market segment  particularly the wireless infrastructure and networking sectors 
during  and the first quarter of  our operating results were negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by communication service providers that purchase our customers products 
although we saw improvement in these economic conditions throughout the balance of and into  these improvements may not continue or may not be sustainable 
if improved conditions do not continue  or instead deteriorate  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we experienced somewhat lower sales during the second half of compared to the first half of primarily due to weakness in demand from one of our largest customers 
gross margins in the second half of reflect a shift in our sales mix during that period  with increased sales coming from certain programs with higher material cost  combined with increased revenues from new programs 
on january  we experienced a fire in part of our facility in belgium  which destroyed some inventory  property and equipment 
we were fully insured at the replacement value for the destroyed items  subject to a  deductible  and the facility returned to full production the next day 
see further discussion in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock on february  the net proceeds from the offering were million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and related interest 
in connection with the offering  we issued  shares of our common stock upon conversion of the original principal amount of our then outstanding senior convertible notes  and issued  shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants 
in addition  in connection with the offering  we amended and restated our existing senior revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation 
the amended facility the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million that are subject to a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  which was million at december  please refer to liquidity and capital resources below for additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness 
during and early  we plan to establish operations in china by constructing a  square foot facility near shanghai  which will result in capital expenditures in being significantly higher than previous years levels 
basis of reporting net sales net sales consist of sales during the period presented  net of returns 
revenue is recognized from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
cost of sales the principal elements comprising cost of sales are raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
raw materials account for a large majority of costs of sales 
raw materials include magnetic sub assemblies  sheet metal  electronic and other components  mechanical parts and electrical wires 
direct labor costs include costs of hourly employees 
manufacturing overhead includes salaries  and the direct expense and allocation of costs attributable to manufacturing for lease costs  depreciation on property  plant and equipment  utilities  property taxes and repairs and maintenance 
operating expenses operating expenses include engineering costs  selling and marketing costs and general and administrative expenses 
engineering costs primarily include salaries and benefits of engineering personnel  safety approval and quality certification fees  depreciation on equipment and subcontract costs for third party contracting services 
selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits to account managers and commissions to independent sales representatives 
administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits for certain management and administrative personnel  professional fees and information system costs 
operating expenses also include the direct expense and allocation of costs attributable to these departments for lease costs  depreciation on property  plant and equipment  utilities  property taxes and repairs and maintenance 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information currently available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer our customers the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for warranty based on historical experience  which has been insignificant to our financial condition and results of operations 
any significant increase in product failure rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which those returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant portion of our accounts receivable are concentrated in a small number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
during and  our top ten customers accounted for approximately and of our net sales  respectively 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory and the current estimated market value of the inventory using the weighted average cost method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical usage data and estimates of future demand 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
as demonstrated during the past five years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time such inventory is sold 
therefore  although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if our future taxable income is significantly higher than expected and or we are able to utilize our tax credits  we may be required to reverse all or a significant part of our valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets which could substantially reduce our effective tax rate for such period 
therefore  any significant changes in statutory tax rates or the amount of our valuation allowance could have a material effect on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
goodwill and long lived assets we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to the accounting value of its net assets 
we also review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing our best estimates  appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
these projected future cash flows may vary significantly over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset would be deemed impaired and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair market value of the asset 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our statements of operations as a percentage of our net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses restructuring costs stock compensation expense operating income interest expense debt restructuring costs other income expense  net net income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle provision for income taxes net income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle goodwill impairment net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased by approximately  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume to a broad base of customers in the datacom  telecom and industrial end markets  due to economic improvements in the end markets in which they operate 
our sales increase included sales from several new customers we have engaged in recent quarters 
sales to three new customers accounted for million of the increase in sales during a favorable foreign currency exchange rate effect of million due to a stronger euro also contributed to the net increase in sales 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  increased to from in the prior year 
of the million increase in gross profit  million was attributable to higher sales volume and the remaining portion was attributable to increased gross margin 
the increase in gross margin was due primarily to a reduction in direct labor and factory overhead costs as a percentage of sales of and  respectively  and was partially offset by a increase in material cost as a percentage of sales 
for the year ended december   direct labor and factory overhead costs as a percentage of sales at cherokee europe improved significantly  reflecting increased efficiencies due to higher production volumes  as well as a lower manufacturing cost structure resulting from the restructuring plan implemented in june  as described below 
these decreases in direct labor and overhead costs as a percentage of sales were partially offset by an increase in material costs as a percentage of sales in both europe and north america  resulting from a change in product mix primarily during the second half of this mix included programs with higher material content than the prior year  as well as increased revenues from new programs  which typically have higher material and labor costs in the early stages of production 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses decreased significantly to from in the prior year 
the net decrease in operating expenses of million was primarily due to one time cherokee europe restructuring costs of million recorded in june described below and a decrease in stock compensation expense of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in engineering and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
these increased expenses were incurred primarily to support the significantly higher sales volume and related business activities compared to a year ago  as well as the additional expenses associated with being a public company 
of these increases  approximately million was attributable to a stronger euro versus the year ended december   million was attributable to higher sales commissions  million was attributable to increased insurance costs primarily for directors and officers liability  and million was attributable to professional fees and public company expenses 
increases in payroll and related costs were substantially offset by decreases in incentive compensation in restructuring costs during  we implemented a restructuring plan involving the elimination of a number of operational and administrative positions at the cherokee europe facility in belgium due to unfavorable economic conditions in that market 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we recorded a charge for restructuring costs of million for the year ended december  the restructuring costs were comprised entirely of one time termination benefits to be paid through we believe our remaining accrual of million will be sufficient to cover any remaining liabilities associated with this restructuring plan 
the following is a breakdown of the cherokee europe restructuring accrual for the period january  through december  in thousands balance as of january  provision payments foreign exchange rate change balance as of december  provision payments foreign exchange rate change balance as of december  stock compensation expense stock compensation expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  in  we recorded stock compensation expense of million primarily in connection with the retirement of our former chairman 
in  we issued  shares of common stock to management for services rendered 
in addition  we issued  shares of common stock to the management of cherokee europe for achieving specified financial performance targets during the second half of  and shares related to the achievement of these performance targets were issued in as a result  we recorded stock compensation in the year ended december  of million  which represented the estimated fair value of these shares as of the historical or proposed issuance date 
operating income as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income increased by approximately  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating margin increased to from in the prior year 
operating income for the year ended december  included the effect of the cherokee europe restructuring costs of million and stock compensation expense of million 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in interest expense was due to the repayment of million of certain outstanding indebtedness and accrued interest  and the conversion to equity of our senior convertible notes  in connection with our initial public offering in february other income  net other income  net for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  other income  net for the year ended december  included a gain on the sale of land of million and foreign currency exchange gains of million 
income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  increased by million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  reflects an effective tax rate of 
the increase in both the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate from was due largely to shifts in the geographical mix of income for and reflects taxable income in belgium as we no longer had net operating losses available in belgium in income generated in the united states during was fully offset by the utilization of deferred tax assets  resulting in the relatively low effective tax rate for the year 
see further discussion of the income tax provision and net operating loss carryforwards in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million was primarily due to an accrual for an estimated tax liability relating to an audit assessment by the india tax authorities for previous years 
net income loss as a result of the factors discussed above  we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million during the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased by approximately  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this sales increase was primarily due to sales to three new customers aggregating million during the current year  mainly in the computing and storage market  and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate effect of million due to a stronger euro  partially offset by lower sales of million related to a fixed quantity project for a customer of cherokee europe that was completed in november gross profit gross profit increased by approximately  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  increased to from in the prior year 
of the million increase in gross profit  million was attributable to the higher sales level and the remaining portion was attributable to the increased gross margin 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower material and direct labor costs as a percentage of sales 
material costs as a percentage of sales decreased by  which resulted primarily from negotiated price decreases with suppliers and lower costs of material due to efforts to redesign products and standardize components 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december   excluding cherokee europe restructuring costs of million and stock compensation expense of million  increased by approximately  or million  to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses increased to from in the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the foreign currency exchange rate effect of million due to a stronger euro in  and to increases in engineering and development expenses of million and selling and marketing expenses of million  which increases were primarily to support the higher sales levels  additional design wins and new product introductions 
restructuring costs during  we implemented a restructuring plan involving the elimination of operational and administrative positions at the cherokee europe facility in belgium due to unfavorable economic conditions in that market 
as of september  we completed all of these terminations 
pursuant to the cherokee europe restructuring plan  we recorded a charge for restructuring costs of million for the year ended december  the restructuring costs are comprised entirely of one time termination benefits to be paid through  and were determined by local labor laws and union labor negotiations 
we paid million of these costs through december  stock compensation expense in july  we issued  shares of common stock to management for services rendered 
in addition  we issued  shares of common stock to the management of cherokee europe for achieving specified financial performance targets during the second half of we recorded stock compensation expense for the achievement of both of these performance targets in the year ended december  of million  which represents the estimated fair value of these shares as of the issuance date 
operating income as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income decreased by approximately  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating margin decreased to from in the prior year 
excluding the effect of the cherokee europe restructuring costs of million and stock compensation expense of million recorded in  operating income increased by approximately  or million  to million for the year ended december   and the operating margin was 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher debt levels compared to the prior year and the effect of higher interest rates resulting from the restructuring transactions 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increased tax provision reflects the accrual of an estimated tax liability relating to an audit assessment by the india tax authorities for previous years 
goodwill impairment in compliance with the requirements of sfas no 
 we completed our transitional impairment test as of january  based on discounted cash flow and industry market multiple valuation methodologies  we determined the carrying value of cherokee europe exceeded its fair value 
based on this valuation  and unfavorable economic trends in the industries in which cherokee europe operates  we concluded that goodwill in the amount of million was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
such impairment charge is reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  net loss as a result of the factors discussed above  we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for goodwill impairment 
net loss including the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we expect our liquidity requirements will be primarily for working capital and capital expenditures 
we have historically financed our capital needs with cash from operations supplemented by borrowings from credit facilities and debt issuances 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and borrowing availability of million under our existing revolving credit facility 
we believe these amounts  together with cash flow from operations  are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock on february  the net proceeds from the offering were million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness  including certain term loans  our old revolving credit facility  our second lien notes  related interest on these obligations  as well as accrued interest and interest added to the principal amount of our senior convertible notes 
the remainder of the net proceeds is held in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  and is reflected in our cash and cash equivalents increase of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  and for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to our million in net income  which reflected a significant increase in sales and business activity from the prior year 
this amount was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories  which were also the result of the increased sales and business activity compared to the prior year  a decrease in accrued liabilities and accrued restructuring costs due mainly to payments for professional fees and restructuring costs  a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due primarily to a reduction in incentive compensation for compared to the prior year  and a decrease in accrued interest payable and other long term obligations due to the payment of accrued and paid in kind interest with a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  primarily reflected a higher loss due to the restructuring of cherokee europe  as well as an increase of accounts receivable and inventories as a result of increased business activity compared to the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in compared to prior years primarily reflects increased purchases of short term investments  increased investments in manufacturing machinery and equipment  and the construction at cherokee europe related to the portion of the building destroyed by fire in the company was fully insured at the replacement value for the destroyed items  subject to a  deductible 
see additional disclosure in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in in february  we completed our initial public offering  which generated net proceeds after debt repayment and expenses of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects net borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million respectively 
our capital expenditures have resulted primarily from investments in equipment to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve manufacturing efficiencies  and the replacement and construction of one of our buildings in belgium destroyed in the fire 
see additional disclosure in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we expect capital expenditures to be between million and million in  primarily as a result of our investment in a manufacturing facility and equipment in china 
contractual obligations as of december   our borrowings consisted of approximately million of senior notes bearing interest at annually  and no borrowings under the credit facility 
we are required to make semi annual interest payments to holders of the senior notes 
we have operating lease obligations relating to our facilities in tustin and irvine  california  and bombay  india 
we have purchase commitments primarily with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  and for other goods  services  and equipment as part of the normal course of business 
these commitments are generally evidenced by purchase orders that may or may not include cancellation provisions 
based on current expectations  we do not believe that any cancellation penalties we incur under these obligations would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the maturities of our long term debt  including capital leases  and future payments relating to our operating leases and other obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt operating leases purchase order commitments european restructuring long service award deferred compensation total long term debt includes our senior notes  which mature on november  interest on the senior notes is payable in cash on may and november of each year 
the senior notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our domestic assets and by a pledge of of the equity of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
in connection with our initial public offering  we amended our existing senior revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million  subject to a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivables and inventory  which was million at december  we plan to use funds available under this credit facility to finance working capital and other cash requirements as needed 
the credit facility matures in august and bears interest  at our option  at a rate per annum equal to libor plus or the agent bank s base rate plus 
in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal  we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the credit facility in respect of the average daily balance of unused loan commitments at a rate of per annum 
the credit facility is our senior obligation and ranks equal in right of payment with our existing and future permitted senior debt including our senior notes  and senior in right of payment to our future permitted subordinated debt 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority lien  subject to permitted encumbrances  on substantially all of our domestic assets and by a pledge of of the equity of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the agreements governing the credit facility and our senior notes contain covenants that restrict our business operations  including covenants limiting our ability to make investments  enter into mergers or acquisitions  dispose of assets  incur additional debt  grant liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  repay other debt and pay dividends  and contains a financial ratio test based on senior leverage 
they also contain customary events of default  including defaults in the payment of principal or interest  defaults in the compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt  cross defaults to other material debt and bankruptcy or other insolvency events 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants set forth in the principal agreements governing our debt 
based on our present expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  working capital and available borrowing capacity at december  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months  including operating requirements  contractual obligations  planned capital expenditures and debt service 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  with respect to variable interest entities created before january   in december the fasb issued fin r which  among other things  revised the implementation date to first fiscal years or interim periods ending after march   with the exception of special purpose entities spe 
the consolidation requirements apply to all spe s in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  as we determined that we did not have any variable interest entities to which these interpretations apply  we adopted fin r in the first quarter of  and such adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb released a revised statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas no 
r  employer s disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised standard provides required disclosure for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans and is designed to improve disclosure transparency in financial statements 
it also requires new interim disclosure regarding certain aspects of a company s plans 
the standard is effective for domestic plans for fiscal years ending after december  and for interim periods beginning after december  it was effective for foreign plans for fiscal years ending after june  and interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the standard and have included the required disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
abnormal amounts of these costs should be recognized as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory costs 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of manufacturing be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this new standard may have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised  share based payment  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
we currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually 
upon adoption  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the provisions of sfas r are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the effect that the adoption of sfas r will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendments eliminate the exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
under apb  accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset is to be based upon the recorded amount of the asset relinquished carryover basis with no gain or loss recognition 
the transaction will now be accounted for based upon the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the statement is effective for exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  and is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and short term interest rates 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments at december  we had no variable rate debt outstanding at december  however  any debt we incur under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on any variable rate debt we may incur in the future  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
the functional currency for our european operations is the euro 
we are  therefore  subject to a certain degree of market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is mitigated by the fact that our revenues and expenses are generally both recorded in euros  thereby reducing the risk of foreign currency translations on our european operations 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results as of and for the year ended december   was not material 
historically  we have not actively engaged in exchange rate hedging activities
