our fiscal year ends on april of each year 
business overview we develop and sell an integrated suite of product lifecycle management plm software products and offer related business consulting and implementation services 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the license of software products under software license agreements and from the delivery of associated professional and maintenance services 
our solutions enable our customers to accelerate their time to market and revenue  reduce costs  improve product quality  ensure regulatory compliance and drive innovation throughout the product lifecycle 
we believe that understanding the following key developments is helpful to an understanding of our operating results for fiscal increased product breadth we sold our first plm product in at that time  our offering consisted of a single product 
over time  we have added features and functionality to our existing products as well as new products  both through internal development and acquisition 
in january  we began shipping agile  our most comprehensive plm product offering to date 
agile provides extensive new features and capabilities  as well as an enterprise technology platform providing customers a broader  deeper plm solution 
as of april   we have licensed products to over  customers worldwide 
expanded industry focus we were initially focused on solutions targeted principally for customers operating in the electronics and high technology and  to a lesser extent  medical device industries 
as we have grown our business and expanded our product suite  we have also expanded our industry focus 
while the electronics and high technology industry still represent the single largest industry for us  we now have significant customers in all of the following industries electronics and high technology  industrial products  life sciences  and others 

table of contents acquisitions our strategy has been  and continues to be  to expand our business both organically and through acquisitions of complementary products  technologies and companies 
we have made the following acquisitions since december onerev  inc onerev  acquired in december  productfactory  inc productfactory  acquired in march  eigner us inc eigner  acquired in august  tradec  inc tradec  acquired in september  and cimmetry systems  inc cimmetry  acquired in february through the acquisition of eigner we acquired what is now our product catalog  requirements management  configuration management  engineering collaboration and maintenance  repair and overhaul products 
eigner also provided us with a stronger presence in the automotive supply chain  industrial equipment  aerospace and defense industries  as well as in certain geographic markets such as the central european region 
through the acquisition of tradec we acquired additional functionality to our existing products as well as new customers 
through the acquisition of cimmetry we acquired visual collaboration software that has become an increasingly important element of plm solutions 
the results of all of these acquisitions are included in our statements of operations beginning as of the respective acquisition date 
restructurings we have taken a number of actions to reduce our expenses to better align our operations and cost structure with current and anticipated market conditions  as follows in fiscal  we evaluated the economic conditions and initiated a restructuring of our operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  primarily related to the consolidation of additional excess facilities and the abandonment of additional property and equipment  during the second quarter of fiscal  in connection with our move to our new headquarters in san jose  california  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  primarily related to our outstanding lease commitments for properties that we vacated in september and the abandonment of certain long lived assets  during the second quarter of fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of eigner  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million primarily related to the termination of employees  to eliminate duplicative activities and reduce the cost structure of the combined company  and during the first quarter of fiscal  we terminated approximately of our worldwide workforce and consolidated our china based development centers into a single location 
in connection with these actions  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
overview of our results we derive revenues from the license of software products under software license agreements and from the delivery of associated professional and maintenance services 
our license revenue is comprised of fees charged for the use of our products licensed under perpetual arrangements 
our service revenue is comprised of fees charged for implementation services and fees charged for post contract customer support ie  technical support and product updates 
our implementation services are typically provided over a period of three to six months subsequent to the signing of a software license arrangement 
post contract customer support is generally purchased at the time of initial license purchase  and renewed annually thereafter 
post contract customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the support period  generally months 

table of contents our revenue has increased by from fiscal to and from fiscal to  as a result of stronger sales from the north american region 
while we believe that demand for our products in north america is strengthening  we have not yet seen the same strengthening in the market outside north america 
the increase in revenue from the european region was mostly due to the acquisition of eigner as well as the strengthening of european currencies compared to the us dollar  while our revenue from asia pacific has decreased due to weak sales in japan 
we will continue to seek to derive revenues from customers in north america as well as internationally 
in fiscal we began to reorganize our international sales organization  a process that is still underway 
in connection with these changes  we have recently hired a new country manager for taiwan  and are seeking new sales leadership for japan 
we were able to achieve the following results in fiscal we recorded record fiscal year total revenues of million  a increase from total revenues of million in fiscal  and a increase from total revenues of million in fiscal our license revenue reached million  a increase from license revenue of million in fiscal  and a increase from license revenue of million in fiscal our net loss declined to million  a decrease from our net loss of million in fiscal  and an decrease from our net loss of million in fiscal our cash flows provided by operations were million 
in addition  we maintained a cash and investments balance as of april  of million 
due to the amortization of the intangibles as a result of the cimmetry acquisition and the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective in our first quarter of fiscal  we will likely not be profitable on a gaap basis for the foreseeable future 
achieving and sustaining profitable results  even on a non gaap basis  will depend upon a combination of careful expense management coupled with higher revenue levels 
many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain expenses at target levels 
there can also be no assurance that our revenues will increase 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain profitable operations in the future 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues  loss from operations  and net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based upon our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained  and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon these statements 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  investments  prepaid software license fees  restructuring reserves  stock options and warrants  and business combinations and acquired intangible assets  which are described below 
in addition  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies may require us to 
table of contents make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our historical financial statements  we monitor our sales pipeline in order to estimate the timing and amount of future revenues 
if we are unable to properly estimate the timing and amount of revenues  our future operations could be significantly impacted 
our sales pipeline may not consistently result in revenues in a particular period  as the data upon which the assumptions and estimates made by us may change 
revenue recognition we recognize our software license revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
we recognize license revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivables is reasonably assured  delivery of the product has occurred and the customer has accepted the product including the expiration of any acceptance period set forth in the contract if the terms of the contract include an acceptance requirement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer and us to be evidence of an arrangement 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
to date  none of our arrangements with our customers grant a right of refund or adjustment to the customer 
reasonable assurance of collection is based upon our assessment of the customer s financial condition through review of their current financial statements or credit reports 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
delivery is considered to occur when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier  or the customer is given electronic access to the licensed software 
with respect to sales to original equipment manufacturers oems and value added resellers vars  delivery is considered to have occurred based on sell through by the oems and vars 
our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses 
in the event that we grant a customer the right to specified upgrades and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for such upgrades  we defer license revenue in an amount equal to this fair value until we have delivered the specified upgrade 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  then we defer recognition of the entire license fee until we deliver the specified upgrade 
if professional services are essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement  we defer recognition of revenue until we have satisfied our professional services obligations 
to date  professional services have not been essential to the functionality of the other elements  and thus have been accounted for separately 
when our software licenses contain multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
multiple element arrangements generally include post contract support pcs or maintenance  software products  and in some cases  other professional services 
revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as pcs  based on the relative fair values of the elements specific to us  and we must analyze each license arrangement carefully to ensure that all of the individual elements have been identified  along with the fair value of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence  which is determined by sales of the individual element to third parties or by reference to a renewal rate specified in the related arrangement 
where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements 
table of contents is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
in most cases  the bundled multiple elements include pcs and the software product 
in such cases  when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements most commonly pcs  the residual or remaining amount is recognized as revenue and the pcs is recognized ratably over the pcs term  which is typically months 
revenues from professional services consist of implementation services and training 
training revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement and are accounted for as a separate element 
professional services are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts or upon achievement of milestones on fixed price contracts 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price professional services contracts is recognized in the period in which the loss becomes known 
customers typically prepay maintenance fees for the first months and the related maintenance revenues are recognized ratably monthly over the term of the maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis  and ongoing support 
deferred revenues include amounts received from customers for which revenue has not yet been recognized that generally results from deferred maintenance  consulting or training services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all requirements under sop are met 
deferred revenue is recognized upon delivery of our products  as services are rendered  or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce amounts to their estimated realizable value 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of accounts receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we initially record a provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  we consider i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable  such as whether it derives from license  professional services or maintenance revenue  iv our historical provision for doubtful accounts  v the credit worthiness of the customer  and vi the economic conditions of the customer s industry as well as general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates that we make may also change  which could impact our future provision for doubtful accounts 
for example  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
our license agreements do not offer our customers the unilateral right to terminate or cancel the contract and receive a cash refund 
however  we provide for sales returns through a reserve that is based upon estimates of potential future credits related to current period revenues 
we analyze historical credits  current economic trends  average deal size  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns reserve 
revenue for the period is reduced to reflect the provision of our reserve for sales returns 
stock options in connection with certain employee restricted common stock and stock option grants  in fiscal we recorded unearned stock compensation totaling  attributable to options granted to our employees with 
table of contents exercise prices below fair market value granted to our employees 
at april   the unamortized balance of the unearned stock compensation was  unearned stock compensation  a component of stockholders equity  represents the fair value of the unvested portion of restricted common stock and the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
unearned stock compensation is amortized through charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  which is generally three to five years  using the accelerated method of amortization as described in financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option award plans 
stock compensation expense  less recoveries  was  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
stock compensation expense related to stock options granted to non employees is recognized as earned  over the applicable vesting period of the options  using the accelerated method of amortization prescribed by fin at each reporting date  we recalculate the value of the stock option using the black scholes option pricing model and record changes in fair value for the unvested portion of the option 
as a result  the stock compensation expense fluctuates with the movement in the fair market value of our common stock 
amortization of stock compensation for non employees was not material for fiscal amortization of stock compensation for non employees was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
on april   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of stock options held by employees and officers under our stock option plans with an exercise price of or higher 
options held by non employee directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
the closing price of our common stock on april   the last trading day before approval of acceleration  was 
as a condition to the acceleration  and to avoid any unintended personal benefits  we also imposed a holding period on shares underlying the accelerated options that will require all optionees to refrain from selling any shares acquired upon the exercise of the options until the date on which such shares would have vested under the options original vesting terms 
the primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to reduce future compensation expense associated with the accelerated stock options upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
our board of directors believes  based on its consideration of this potential expense savings and the current intrinsic and perceived value of the accelerated stock options  that the acceleration is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
the board of directors further believes that the acceleration is consistent with possible changes to our overall equity compensation approach  which are expected to include a reduced use of stock options 
business combinations and acquired intangible assets we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as developed technologies  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs ipr d  if any  are immediately expensed in the period the acquisition is completed 
identifiable intangible assets are currently amortized over one to five years using the straight line method 
the majority of entities we acquire do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets  potential charges related to ipr d for future acquisitions  and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make 
table of contents significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and we then compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
annual goodwill impairment testing will be performed  at a minimum  during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the entire portion of our deferred tax assets  including the net operating losses related to the income tax benefits arising from the exercise of employees stock options  the benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance as well

table of contents total revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increases in both license and service revenue as the result of our acquisition of eigner as well as the growth from our new products to existing and new customers in north america 
excluding the contribution from eigner  total revenues for fiscal increased by million from the prior year period 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
our products have an unpredictable sales cycle 
the timing of large orders  which continue to account for a significant percentage of our total license revenue  remains unpredictable as a result of the overall economic conditions and cautious capital spending by businesses 
during fiscal   and  no one customer accounted for more than of total revenues 
our revenues by geographic region for fiscal   and are as follows fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages north america europe asia pacific total revenues during fiscal   and  revenues from customers located outside of north america were approximately   and of total revenues  respectively 
during fiscal and  revenues from customers located outside of north america were derived primarily from sales to customers in europe and  to a lesser extent  the asia pacific region 
however  during fiscal our revenues outside of north america were derived primarily from sales to customers in the asia pacific region and  to a lesser extent  europe 
the increase in sales to customers located outside of north america during fiscal and was primarily related to our acquisition of eigner  whose customer base was largely located in europe  as well as the benefit derived from the strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar during fiscal sales to customers located in asia pacific decreased in fiscal primarily related to weak sales in japan 
license revenue fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages license revenue as a percentage of total revenues the increase in license revenue in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily due to increases in sales of newer products to new and existing customers in north america of million  slightly offset by the decrease in international sales  in particular sales to customers in japan 
the increase in license revenue as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal was due to a more significant increase in license revenue than in service revenue 
the increase in license revenue in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily due to the addition of eigner products and customers mainly in europe 
the decrease in license revenue as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal was primarily due to a more significant increase in service revenue as discussed below 

table of contents service revenue fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages professional service maintenance total service revenue as a percentage of total revenues service revenue includes fees earned  and to a lesser extent reimbursable expenses incurred  in connection with consulting  software implementation and training services we provide to our customers as well as fees from software maintenance agreements we offer 
service revenue inherently lags behind the related license revenue as the service engagements and maintenance and the related revenue commence after the initial license sale 
as a result  the positive impact of increasing license revenue on service revenue tends to be delayed by one to two quarters 
additionally  as our maintenance revenue has a larger customer base than our license revenue  the percentage of increase in maintenance revenue and thus service revenue may be smaller than the percentage of increase in license revenue 
the increase in service revenue in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily due to a million increase in professional service and maintenance revenue in north america  driven by our growth in license revenue 
the decrease in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal was due to a more significant increase in license revenue than in service revenue 
the increase in service revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to was primarily due to our acquisition of eigner  whose revenue comprised primarily professional service and maintenance revenue in the european region  combined with an increase in our implementation services as we are now selling a more comprehensive solution across all regions 
in addition  maintenance revenue increased due to year over year growth of our installed customer base 
excluding the contribution from eigner  total service revenue for fiscal increased by million from the prior year period 
our maintenance revenue depends upon both our software license revenue and renewals of maintenance agreements by our existing customers 
our maintenance revenue has increased on a year over year basis in each of fiscal  and as a result of both new licenses and a high maintenance renewal rate 
due to the weak economic environment and in many cases significant reductions in personnel at many of our customers  we have experienced reductions in the size of some contract renewals as customers have elected to reduce the number of user licenses for which they are purchasing maintenance 
we expect that service revenue will increase or decrease somewhat in relation to our license revenue 
cost of revenues cost of license revenue fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue our cost of license revenue includes license fees due to third parties for technology integrated into or sold with our products  and the cost of order fulfillment such as shipping and packaging 
the increase in cost of license revenue in absolute dollars from fiscal to and fiscal to was primarily due to our overall increase in license revenue 
the increase in cost of license revenue as a 
table of contents percentage of license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the sale of more licenses with embedded third party software  mainly eigner products  resulting in an increase in license fees paid to third parties on third party software integrated into our products 
with the introduction of agile in late fiscal and acquisition of cimmetry in late fiscal  cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue in fiscal decreased as agile has a relatively lower embedded third party software cost 
for fiscal  we expect cost of license revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of license revenue to decrease somewhat as a result of the elimination of royalties payable to cimmetry 
actual results  however  may fluctuate depending upon the amount of non embedded third party software sold in any particular period 
cost of service revenue fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages cost of service as a percentage of service revenue our cost of service revenue includes salaries and related expenses for the implementation  training services  and customer support organizations  costs of third parties contracted to provide implementation services to customers and an allocation of overhead expenses  including rent  information technology and other overhead expenses 
in addition  cost of service revenue includes support and upgrade fees paid to third parties with respect to the third party software integrated into or sold with our products for which our customers have purchased support from us 
the increase in cost of service revenue in absolute dollars from fiscal to and from fiscal to was primarily due to our overall increase in service revenue 
the increase in cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue during fiscal was primarily a result of increased reliance on third party service providers  which provide lower margins than can be achieved when utilizing internal resources 
for fiscal  we expect cost of service revenue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of service revenue compared to fiscal  as we expect to hire additional professional service personnel to meet increasing customer needs for services 
impairment of prepaid software licenses cost of revenues for fiscal and include charges of  and million  respectively  for the impairment of non refundable prepaid software licenses fees 
we determined that the carrying value of these prepaid software licenses exceeded their net realizable value as a result of our decision to discontinue selling some of our products in which such third party licensed software was embedded 
operating expenses we classify all charges to operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each category includes expenses that are unique to the category type  there are common recurring expenditures that are typically included in all operating expense categories  such as salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  travel costs  communication  rent and other allocated facilities costs  information technology  and professional fees 
also included in our operating expenses is the amortization of stock compensation that is included in each of the sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative categories 

table of contents as a result of our prior period restructuring efforts  as discussed further under restructuring charges below  we have realized significant costs savings to our operating expenses during each of the periods presented 
specifically  during fiscal and  our aggregate facilities and depreciation expenses decreased million and million  respectively  when compared to our facilities and depreciation expenses during the respective prior periods 
significant portions of these costs savings  therefore  are reflected in the sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative operating expenses through decreased facilities and depreciation expenses 
sales and marketing the following table sets forth a summary of our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal  and  excluding the stock compensation which is explained separately under stock compensation recovery below 
fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing  excluding stock compensation as a percentage of total revenues in addition to the common recurring expenditures mentioned above  our sales and marketing expenses include expenditures specific to the sales group  such as sales related commissions and bonuses  and expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  marketing collateral materials  and customer user group meetings  net of fees assessed  if any  for attendance 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock compensation  in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily related to increased personnel related costs and sales incentive compensation associated with higher revenues 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock compensation  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to was primarily related to a  decrease in marketing and advertising costs as part of our reduction in direct advertising and corporate marketing programs  a  decrease in personnel related costs  primarily due to decreases in sales and marketing employee benefits and severances  and a million decrease in facilities and depreciation expenses 
for fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock compensation  to increase or decrease in absolute dollars in proportion to increases or decreases in our license revenue 
research and development the following table sets forth a summary of our research and development expenses in absolute dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal  and  excluding the stock compensation which is explained separately under stock compensation recovery below 
fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages research and development  excluding stock compensation as a percentage of total revenues in addition to the common recurring expenditures mentioned above  our research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  and quality assurance procedures 
these costs primarily consist of employee salaries  benefits  consulting costs and the cost of software development tools and equipment 
to date  we have expensed as incurred all software development costs in research and development 

table of contents the increase in research and development expenses  excluding stock compensation  in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily due to the addition of cimmetry s research and development activities 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased due to a more significant increase in total revenues compared to research and development expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses  excluding stock compensation  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to was primarily due to lower outside consulting and lower operating costs  including salaries and related expenses  resulting from our continuing shift to new development centers in india and china  as well as million in decreases in our headquarter facilities and depreciation expenses 
for fiscal  we expect research and development expenses  excluding stock compensation  in absolute dollars to increase when compared to our results for fiscal as a result of the addition of cimmetry and other product development initiatives

the increase in general and administrative expenses  excluding stock compensation  in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily related to i million in increased compensation and benefits  resulting from an increase in the number of general and administrative employees  primarily due to the addition of the eigner employees  ii  in increased provisions for doubtful accounts  as a result of an increase in accounts receivable associated with increased revenue  and iii  in increased travel and outside consultants related primarily to the integration of the companies acquired during the fiscal year  mainly eigner 
for fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses  excluding stock compensation  to increase in absolute dollars when compared with our results for fiscal primarily due to additional costs related to cimmetry  slightly offset by the decrease in costs to comply with the rules and regulations adopted in response to the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents stock compensation recovery fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages stock compensation cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock compensation as a percentage of total revenues stock compensation includes the amortization of unearned employee stock compensation  expenses incurred as a result of modifications to the terms of certain stock option grants  and expenses associated with options issued to non employees  offset by recoveries associated with the impact of the reversal of accelerated amortization on unvested options cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
the fair value of stock options granted to non employees is recognized as an expense as the underlying stock options vest 
we are required to remeasure the fair value of these options at each reporting period prior to vesting and then finally at the vesting dates of these options 
as a result  the stock compensation for non employees fluctuates with the movement in the fair value of our common stock 
the decrease in stock compensation expense in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily due to lower amortization associated with options granted in prior periods and fewer options granted to our employees with an exercise price below fair market value 
we amortize the stock compensation using the accelerated method as described in fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option award plans 
the increase in stock compensation expense in absolute dollars from fiscal to was primarily related to i million in increased employee related stock compensation  primarily related to the modification of certain stock option grants to employees we terminated during fiscal  and ii  in decreased recoveries recognized from the reversal of accelerated amortization on cancelled options that had been held by terminated employees 
these amounts were offset by a decrease of  in stock compensation recognized on stock options granted to non employees in prior periods  as the fair value of these stock options has decreased 
as of april   the estimated future amortization expense of unearned stock compensation was as follows in thousands fiscal year effective may   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
as a result  the calculation of employee stock compensation expenses and its related amortization will be significantly higher than the amount recorded in fiscal see note the company and summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements and note subsequent events of our consolidated financial statements included below

intangible assets consist of developed technologies  customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements acquired as part of our acquisitions described above 
intangible assets are subject to amortization and have original estimated weighted average useful lives ranging from one to five years 
no significant residual value is estimated for the intangible assets

table of contents as of april   the estimated future amortization expense of acquired intangible assets is as follows in thousands fiscal years we may continue purchasing assets or businesses to accelerate industry or geographic expansion  or increase the features and functions of our products 
these purchase transactions may result in the creation of additional intangible assets that leads to a corresponding increase in our amortization expense in future periods 
our future operating performance could be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets 
acquired in process research and development fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages acquired in process research and development as a percentage of total revenues in connection with various acquisitions we made during fiscal and  we allocated a portion of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development ipr d 
the amounts allocated to the acquired ipr d were immediately expensed in the period each acquisition was completed because the projects associated with the acquired ipr d efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and no future alternative uses existed for the technology 
in calculating the value of the acquired ipr d  we  with the assistance of an independent appraiser  used established valuation techniques accepted in the technology and software industries 
this calculation gave consideration to relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles  and the estimated lives of each of the products derived from the underlying technology 
the value of the acquired ipr d reflects the relative value and contribution of the acquired research and development 
consideration was given to the stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred  and the expected cost to complete the project in determining the value assigned to the acquired ipr d 
the projects have been subsequently completed within our estimates 
during fiscal and  we recognized charges of million and  for acquired ipr d related to our acquisitions of cimmetry and eigner  respectively 
during fiscal  we recognized a  charge for acquired ipr d related to our acquisitions of onerev and productfactory 
restructuring charges fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages restructuring charges as a percentage of total revenues from time to time  management has initiated various restructurings of our operations and facilities 
these restructurings have been taken primarily in response to redundant or excess capacity brought about by 
table of contents acquisitions and or significant changes in economic conditions and market demand 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million the restructuring 
the restructuring consisted primarily of the consolidation of excess facilities and abandonment of certain assets in connection with the consolidation of excess facilities 
as of april    of the restructuring obligations remained  which represents costs related to excess facilities 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million the restructuring as follows in connection with our move to our new headquarters in san jose  california  during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  which was comprised of i million related to the fair value of the remainder of our outstanding lease commitments for properties that we vacated in september  net of the fair value of estimated sublease income and net of deferred rent of  related to the vacated properties  and ii million related to the abandonment of certain long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer equipment 
in connection with our acquisition of eigner during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million  primarily related to the severance  benefits  payroll taxes and other associated costs of the termination of agile employees see note business combination eigner 
as of april   million of the restructuring obligations remained  which represents costs related to excess facilities 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we announced a further restructuring involving termination of employment of approximately of our employees worldwide and consolidation of our chinese development centers into a single location the restructuring 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
as of april    of the restructuring obligations remained  which represents costs related to severance 
we review the assumptions used in estimating our restructuring charges  principally sublease income expectations for excess facilities and employee termination expenses  quarterly 
based upon this review  we did not make any material adjustments to our prior restructuring estimates and assumptions during the quarter ended april  furthermore  we currently do not expect our existing restructuring estimates and assumptions to change materially

the increase in interest and other income  net from fiscal to was due principally to higher interest rates  partially offset by lower average cash and investment balances principally due to the acquisition of cimmetry 
the decrease in interest and other income  net from fiscal to was due principally to lower interest rates and  to a lesser extent  lower average cash and investment balances 

table of contents for fiscal  we expect interest and other income  net in absolute dollars to be comparable to our results for fiscal as we expect the average interest rate to be higher but offset by lower overall cash  cash equivalents and investments balance as a result of the acquisition of cimmetry 
loss from foreign currency translation fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages loss from foreign currency translation as a percentage of total revenues in connection with our acquisition of eigner  we assumed an obligation with a vendor to eigner  providing for quarterly payments denominated in euros through fiscal as the obligation was denominated in euros  and the functional currency of the subsidiary holding the obligation was the us dollar  we were required to remeasure the value of the obligation at the end of each period 
as a result of the euro strengthening against the us dollar during the second and third quarters of fiscal  a remeasurement of the obligation at the end of each such period to the functional currency  net of payments made  resulted in an unrealized loss from foreign currency translation of  in fiscal  the obligation was assigned to a subsidiary that has the same functional currency as the obligation 
impairment of investments fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages impairment of investments as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal  we determined that certain investments that we had made in privately held companies and a venture fund had incurred a decline in value that  based upon the deterioration of the financial condition of the issuers and portfolio companies of the venture fund  was considered other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to write down the investments to their estimated fair values 
at april   the carrying value of our private equity investments was zero 
provision for income taxes fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes effective income tax rates our provision for income taxes primarily reflects actual taxes associated with our international operations  since we incurred overall net losses in all fiscal years presented 
as a result  our effective income tax rates have fluctuated and have not correlated to our operating income or loss 
other than the provision for foreign taxes  and to a lesser extent  provision for state income taxes and us deferred tax liabilities  no provision for income taxes has been recorded since our inception because we have incurred net losses in all periods 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  as sufficient uncertainty exists regarding our ability to realize the deferred tax asset balance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our principal source of liquidity consists of cash  cash equivalents and investments  as follows in thousands as of april  cash and cash equivalents short term and long term investments our cash  cash equivalents  and investments are placed with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure 
our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products  which are subject to rapid technological changes  or a reduction of capital expenditures by our customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among other factors 
as of april   our working capital was million and our days sales outstanding was days 
cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal consists of our net loss for the period of million and a net decrease of approximately million in other operating assets and liabilities  offset by non cash items of million primarily depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily due to our net loss for the period of million  offset by non cash items of million  and a net decrease of approximately million in working capital 
cash provided by investing activities during fiscal resulted from million of net maturities of short term and long term investments  offset by million cash paid in business combinations and million of purchases of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal resulted from million of purchases of property and equipment  primarily related to tenant improvements made at our corporate headquarters in san jose  california  and million of net cash paid in business combinations  offset by million of net maturities of short term and long term investments 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and was primarily due to the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  cash provided from financing activities was offset slightly by the settlement of certain capital lease obligations acquired totaling  we expect cash provided by financing activities to decrease in future periods as we grant fewer stock options to our employees 
we anticipate that our operating expenses  particularly in sales and marketing and research and development will constitute a material use of our cash resources over the next quarter  partially offset by anticipated collections of accounts receivable 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations and commitments mainly consist of operating leases for facilities and future royalty payments 
our future fixed commitments consisted of the following as of april  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations and commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years operating leases purchase commitments others total operating lease obligations have not been reduced by estimated sublease income of  operating lease obligations also include million of accrued excess facilities costs 
we lease facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire through july in connection with our acquisition of eigner  we assumed a commitment for monthly payments through fiscal and quarterly payments through fiscal to purchase software license and consulting services from a vendor to eigner others consists of a mortgage loan payable in equal quarterly installments of approximately  plus variable interest rate currently at  until year  and is collateralized by our land and building located at egerkingen  switzerland and a purchase commitment of approximately  per month until may we sell our software licenses and services to our customers under software license agreements 
each software license agreement contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer  and generally includes provisions that indemnify the customer against losses  expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event our software is found to infringe upon a third party patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary right 
the software license agreement generally limits the scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including but not limited to certain time and geography based scope limitations and a right to replace an infringing product 
we believe our internal development processes and other policies and practices limit our exposure related to the indemnification provisions of software license agreement 
in addition  we require our employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions agreement  which further protects our confidential and proprietary information and assigns the rights of our employees development work to us 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and we are not aware of any material claims 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification provisions in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnification provisions under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and  accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab no 
covers key topics related to the implementation of sfas no 
r which include the valuation models  expected volatility  expected option term  income tax effects of sfas no 
r  classification of stock based compensation cost  capitalization of compensation costs  and disclosure requirements 
we adopted sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal see note subsequent events and will begin to recognize stock based compensation related to employee equity awards in our condensed consolidated statements of operations using a fair value 
table of contents based method on a prospective basis 
since we currently account for equity awards granted to our employees using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we develop products in the united states  canada  germany  india  and china  and market our products primarily in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
in the second half of fiscal  we started to sell our products through some of our foreign subsidiaries in their functional currencies  which provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their functional currencies 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
interest rate risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us short term interest rates  particularly since all of our investments are in instruments with maturities of less than two years 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our entire portfolio of cash in money market funds and investments classified as available for sale 
in general  money market funds and investments with maturities of less than two years are not subject to significant market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
because our mortgage arrangement is based on variable rates of interest  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates environment 
since these obligations represent a small percentage of our total capitalization  we believe that there is not a material risk exposure 
the table below represents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity of our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates 
maturing within months maturing between and years thereafter total cash equivalents weighted average interest rate investments in fixed maturity securities weighted average interest rate total 
table of contents risk factors if any of the events described in the following risk factors occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
any forward looking statements set forth in this report should be considered in light of the factors discussed below 
defects in our software products could harm our reputation  diminish demand for our products  be costly to remediate  expose us to litigation and or cause our revenue to decline our software products are complex and may contain errors that may be detected at any point in the life of the product 
this risk is more significant as it relates to new products  where there is limited experience with the product in customer environments  and increases with the complexity of the product in question 
we began shipping agile in january agile is a suite of products based on a newly developed architecture  and provides extensive new features and capabilities delivered on an enterprise technology platform 
agile has also been developed to operate with a wider array of database  applications server and underlying technologies than were our prior products 
some of these underlying technologies are themselves relatively new and immature both with respect to their stability and the ability to integrate with other applications 
in addition  more than was the case with our prior products  agile is being implemented to address a broader range of customer requirements 
as can be expected with software as complex as agile  in the course of customer implementation activities for agile with which we have been involved to date  we have encountered bugs and errors not identified during our pre release testing 
while we do not believe that any of these bugs or errors affect the functionality of agile  these errors  and other errors we may find in agile or in any of the other products we sell  including the soon to be released agile e or the recently acquired cimmetry product line  could result in i lost or delayed revenue and market acceptance  ii injury to our reputation  iii increased service and warranty costs  including the potential need to provide services at reduced fees or no charge at all in order to address customer concerns  and iv claims or litigation for breach of contract or warranty 
any of these adverse consequences  either alone or in conjunction with others  could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations 
if we do not achieve a high level of customer satisfaction  our customers may not purchase additional products from us and our reputation in the market could suffer  adversely impacting our ability to attract new customers the size of a new customer s initial order is often relatively small and may include a limited number of user licenses 
in subsequent orders  customers typically add user licenses and or additional products 
we depend  to a significant extent  on sales of additional user licenses and products to our existing customers to grow our revenues 
therefore  it is important that our customers are satisfied with their initial product implementations and that they believe that expanded use of the product they purchased will provide them with additional benefits 
our products are generally integrated with many disparate systems operated by our customers 
through our professional services organization  we provide implementation services for our software on a fee for service basis 
implementations generally involve migrating data from existing systems  and configuring the agile products to operate with the customers existing computer systems and software 
agile  first released in january  and the soon to be released agile e  each provide new product modules  extensive new features and capabilities and are designed to address a broader set of business objectives than were our prior products 
agile and agile e implementations may involve multiple products being deployed across multiple departments within the customer organizations and configuring the agile software to operate with a broader range of existing systems and software 
as a result  implementations of agile and agile e will often take longer than was the case with our earlier products  where only one product was deployed across a typically narrower user base  and may lead to delays in  or the failure to place  orders for additional licenses or products 
this is particularly true where delays in implementation cause delays in the deployment and initial production use of our products 

table of contents the added product modules  features and functionality of our newer products has also meant that our newer products sometimes require more user training than was the case with our prior products 
in addition  as is often the case with major software upgrades  customers who were accustomed to the user interfaces and commands of prior versions of our software have in some cases experienced dissatisfaction with the new user interfaces  and at having to learn the new commands and navigation tools of agile such user experiences can lead to dissatisfaction with our products as a whole and delays in  or the failure to place  orders for additional licenses or products 
failure to maintain customer satisfaction for any reason could mean that follow on orders would be delayed or may not occur at all  either of which would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
the timing of large orders is highly unpredictable 
our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
unpredicted revenue shortfalls could disproportionately and adversely affect operating results 
if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock may decline significantly our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
our products have a complex and unpredictable sales cycle 
the timing of large orders  which can account for a significant percentage of our total license revenue  remains unpredictable as a result of the overall economic conditions  cautious capital spending by businesses and customer expenditure approval processes 
in addition  due to the longer implementation cycles associated with our newer products  follow on orders from existing customers may not follow original orders as quickly as they have done in the past thus making the timing of such orders harder to predict 
if any large order anticipated for a particular quarter is not received in that quarter  or the related license revenue is not recognizable in that quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues 
in contrast  our expense levels are relatively fixed in the near term and are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
as a result  a revenue shortfall from estimated levels can cause a disproportionately adverse impact on our operating results for the quarter in which the revenue shortfall occurs 
due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below our guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  potentially significantly 
if our service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenues  our gross margins could decrease  demand for our services is exceeding internal capacity  increasing reliance on third party subcontractors which adversely impacts gross margin  we currently perform some of our implementations on a fixed price basis  which could cause us to incur more costs than we expect we realize lower margins on service revenue  particularly with respect to professional services  than on license revenue 
as a result  if service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenues  or  if we increase our use of third parties to provide such services  our gross margins may decrease 
the profitability of our professional services is critically dependent on our ability to maintain a minimum average billing rate and a fairly high utilization level of professional services personnel 
if we are unable to maintain or improve our billing and utilization rates  the profitability of our professional services activities  our service revenue and our overall profitability will suffer 
during fiscal  demand for our services  principally implementation services for agile  began to exceed the capacity of our internal services organization 
as a result  we have had to engage third parties to subcontract all or a portion of the services engagements in some instances 
the costs associated with using third parties are significantly higher than the costs associated with direct delivery of services 
as a result  the increased 
table of contents use of third parties has adversely impacted our services gross margins 
we expect to continue to rely to a significant extent on third parties for the next few quarters which will continue to adversely affect our gross margins 
in addition  beginning in fiscal and continuing into fiscal  we have been hiring additional personnel for our professional services organization 
newly hired services personnel require up front training and take some time before becoming fully productive 
accordingly  the addition of a significant number of new services personnel can adversely affect services margins in the short term 
as a result of our continued reliance on third party contractors and our recent and anticipated hiring  we expect the gross margins on our services business during fiscal to decline from the level achieved in fiscal we may at times charge customers a fixed fee for installation services 
if we underestimate the amount of time or resources required to install our products in fixed fee situations  our gross margins could decline  adversely impacting our operating results 
we have recently made several acquisitions and expect to make additional acquisitions in the future 
if we fail to successfully integrate the acquired companies  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
if we fail to identify and successfully acquire additional products  technologies and companies  our long term competitive position may be adversely affected in february  we acquired substantially all of the business assets of cimmetry  inc  during fiscal  we acquired eigner us inc 
and tradec  inc and during fiscal  we acquired onerev  inc 
and productfactory  inc while each of these acquisitions has resulted or is expected to result in benefits to us as a combined company  achieving the full benefits of each of these and any future acquisitions depends on many factors  including the successful and timely integration of the products  technologies and operations of the acquired companies 
these integration efforts are difficult and time consuming  especially considering the highly technical and complex nature of each company s products 
we may encounter risks to our business during our integration of acquired products  technologies or companies including difficulties in integration of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions such as integration expenses and expenses associated with retiring excess facilities or other assets  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on our existing business relationships with our customers and business partners  and the risk of losing the customers of acquired companies particularly where  as is the case with our recent cimmetry acquisition  those customers may compete with us  inability to retain key employees of acquired companies  and difficulties and added expenses associated with bringing acquired companies into our internal control framework in a timely manner as may be required for on going compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of if we are unable to successfully and timely integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies  or to train  retain and motivate personnel from acquired companies  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisitions 
going forward  we believe that acquiring additional products  technologies and or companies will be important to remaining competitive in the plm marketplace 
however  we may not be able to identify complementary acquisition targets or  even once targets are identified  we may not be able to reach agreement on the terms of acquisition or complete the acquisitions 
acquisitions could cause us to issue dilutive equity securities  incur debt or contingent liabilities  amortize goodwill and other intangibles  write off in process research and development and other acquisition related expenses  any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

table of contents uncertainty about the impact of sfas r could adversely affect us effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted sfas r  which will result in a significant difference in the way in which we account for employee stock options 
sfas r is relatively new and  while it is expected to become mandatory in the future  to date has not yet been adopted by many companies 
as a result  it may be difficult for analysts and others reviewing our financial statements to compare our financial statements to our prior period statements and to those of other companies that have not adopted sfas r 
our stock price could be adversely affected if  as a result of adoption sfas r  our financial performance compares unfavorably to other similarly situated companies 
in addition  in connection with the adoption of sfas r  we will be required to develop appropriate assumptions and a model for valuing equity based compensation for which there are not clear standards 
there is a risk that  either through an error in application or as a result of subsequent accounting guidelines  we could determine that the assumptions or model we used requires modification 
if that were to occur  we may be required to correct the charges taken with respect to employee equity based compensation 
finally  in connection with the adoption of sfas r  we are reviewing our overall equity compensation strategy  and anticipate issuing fewer stock options to our employees than we have in the past 
these changes in approaches to employee compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain the highly qualified personnel we need to succeed 
we have a history of losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability since inception  we have funded our business primarily through selling our stock  not from cash generated from our business 
we have incurred annual losses in each of the years since we were formed 
we incurred losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of april   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
due to the amortization of the intangibles as a result of the cimmetry acquisition and the adoption of fas r effective in our first quarter of fiscal  we will likely not be profitable on a gaap basis for the foreseeable future 
achieving and sustaining profitable results  even on a non gaap basis  will depend upon a combination of careful expense management coupled with higher revenue levels 
many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain expenses at target levels 
there can also be no assurance that our revenues will increase 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain profitable operations in the future 
our success depends upon attracting and retaining qualified employees our success as a company is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we are currently seeking to hire technically qualified individuals to augment the resources in our services delivery  product development and product support 
if we are unable to attract the qualified people we seek  or if we are unable to retain our existing employees  our customer satisfaction and therefore our business could suffer 
in addition  it generally takes six to months for a sales executive to become fully productive 
turnover of sales executives tends to be higher in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
if we are unable to retain our key sales executives  our revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
software product development is inherently complex  and we could experience difficulties in introducing new products and upgrades which could result in lost or delayed sales in addition to agile  agile advantage  agile e and the newly acquired cimmetry products  our future financial performance also depends on our successful and timely development  introduction and market acceptance of other new and enhanced products  including products that we may introduce using technology that we acquire from other companies 
the lifecycles of our products are difficult to predict because the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 

table of contents although our software products can be used with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms  there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace that may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design 
it may be necessary for us to invest significant resources to adapt our software if new or different platforms or operating environments become widely adopted in our current and prospective customer base 
in addition  we believe that our software must be able to accommodate substantial numbers of users to achieve the level of market acceptance and customer satisfaction that we believe is critical to our success 
if we are unable to offer new and enhanced products as the market and technology evolve  if our products are not sufficiently scalable  or if we encounter development difficulties with new products we release  we may find it difficult to sell products to existing and prospective customers 
moreover  customers may delay purchasing decisions if they are aware that new or enhanced products are soon to be released 
if we experience difficulties or delays in releasing new and enhanced products that customers are expecting  we may experience lost or delayed sales 
delays in releasing new and enhanced products could have a material negative impact on our results of operations  particularly in the periods when the new or enhanced products were expected to become available 
we have many new sales representatives  particularly in our international sales force  who could take time to reach productivity which could result in lost or delayed sales we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force 
late in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  we reorganized our north american sales organization 
in fiscal we began to reorganize our international sales organization  a process that is still underway 
in connection with these changes  we have recently hired a new country manager for taiwan  and are seeking new sales leadership for japan 
as a result of these changes  many of our account executives  particularly our international sales executives  are relatively new to agile 
it generally takes six to twelve months for a new account executive to become fully productive 
changes in account executives can also result in the need to reestablish relationships with existing customers 
this can result in dissatisfaction  and lost or delayed sales as customers become accustomed to their new account executives 
in addition  a significant number of eigner sales personnel joined agile as a result of the eigner acquisition  and we expect to add further sales personnel as a result of our acquisition of cimmetry 
training these individuals on the agile products and the agile sales personnel on the products acquired with eigner and with cimmetry is and will be a substantial undertaking and is still ongoing 
the ability of our entire sales force to effectively sell our full suite of products will be important to our growth 
if the new members of our sales team are unable to quickly become fully productive  or if we cannot successfully cross train our expanded sales force in our full suite of products  it may be difficult for us to sell our products  we may lose sales opportunities and market share  take longer to close anticipated sales  and experience a shortfall in revenues 
competition among providers of product lifecycle management software may increase  particularly if industry consolidation continues  which may cause us to reduce price  and experience accompanying reduced gross margins or loss business to competitors  resulting ultimately in a loss of market share we believe that the market for product lifecycle management solutions is becoming increasingly competitive due to a number of factors  including i consolidation in the product lifecycle management software industry  ii alliances among existing competitors  iii alliances between our competitors and systems integrators  and iv entry of new competitors 
in addition  as a result of the increasing availability of offshore software development resources efforts  we have begun to face additional competition from customers and prospective customers custom development efforts 
finally  we are seeing pricing pressure from customers and prospects that  during the recent economic downturn  became accustomed to receiving substantial discounts on all of their purchases 
we have occasionally experienced some pricing pressure on sales of our products  where competitors have offered to sell licenses at much lower cost in exchange for customer purchases of maintenance or other products 
table of contents or services from the competitor 
in some situations  we believe competitors may have offered initial licenses at no cost in order to establish a relationship with the customer 
we expect that these pressures will continue  particularly with the constraint in the capital budgets for purchases of enterprise software that our customers are operating under 
in order to remain competitive  and retain or expand our market share  and to expand into new industries  we may have to meet some of these demands for lower prices on our license fees  and offer initial licenses at low  or even no cost  to the customer 
there is a risk that  even as the economy improves overall  businesses may not increase their information technology spending commensurate with their business growth 
moreover  even in an environment of increasing information technology spending  we and other plm vendors are not only competing for plm opportunities but also competing against unrelated internal projects and against vendors of unrelated products and services  all of whom are competing for the limited information technology funding being made available by current and prospective customers 
there can be no assurance that plm in general or agile in particular will compete favorably against other potential uses of information technology spending 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competition  particularly competitors that have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than us to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
also  many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged to gain market share to our detriment 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and offer more attractive terms to purchasers than we can 
these and other competitive factors could result in price reductions  reduced revenues and gross margins and lost market share and an inability to expand into new markets and industries  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we have significantly expanded our international operations which has increased our exposure to risks inherent in conducting business activities in geographies outside of the united states in may  we began establishing research and development operations in india and china and in august  through our acquisition of eigner  we began significant operations in germany 
additionally  in february we began significant operations in canada through our acquisition of cimmetry 
we also have sales offices located in many additional locations 
in addition to the increase in our international operations  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the united states 
for example  during fiscal  revenues from customers located outside of north america were approximately of total revenues 
we expect both our operations and revenues from outside of north america to represent a significant portion of our overall operations and revenues  respectively 
our recent and expected international expansion subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting operations internationally  including difficulties in managing geographically disparate operations  longer sales cycles associated with educating foreign customers on the benefits of using our products  greater difficulty and longer time in collecting accounts receivable from customers located abroad  difficulty in providing customer support for our software in multiple time zones and languages  the need to develop our software in multiple foreign languages  difficulties in enforcing agreements through non us legal systems  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements that may limit our ability to export our software or sell into particular jurisdictions or impose multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  
table of contents political and economic instability  civil unrest or war  terrorist activities that impact international commerce  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights  particularly in countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws and practices of the united states  changing laws and policies affecting economic liberalization  foreign investment  currency convertibility or exchange rates  taxation or employment  and nationalization of foreign owned assets  including intellectual property 
in addition  prior to the acquisition of eigner  most of our revenues have been denominated in united states dollars 
in both europe and japan  an increasing portion of our revenues is denominated in local currencies euro and yen  respectively 
as a result  we are exposed to greater risks in currency fluctuations 
we currently do not engage in foreign exchange hedging activities  and therefore our international revenues and expenses are currently subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
for example  we assumed a euro denominated obligation in connection with our acquisition of eigner 
as a result of the euro strengthening against the us dollar during fiscal  we recorded an unrealized loss from foreign currency translation of  related to this obligation 
we believe that continued expansion of our international operations will be necessary for our future success  and a key aspect to our business strategy has been and is to expand our sales and support organizations internationally 
therefore  we believe that we will need to commit additional significant resources to expand our international operations 
if we are unable to successfully expand further in international markets on a timely basis  or if this expansion is more difficult than expected  we may not be able to achieve desired levels of revenue growth 
in addition  due to the time delay between hiring sales executives and such executives becoming fully productive  expansion of our international operations could have the near term effect of increasing our cost structure without an immediate corresponding increase in revenues thus adversely affecting our profitability 
our efforts to expand sales of our products to other industries may not succeed  thereby limiting our available markets and revenue growth potential we currently sell our products primarily to companies in the electronics high technology  industrial including automotive and aerospace and life sciences industries 
we also market products to customers in additional industries  including consumer packaged goods  retail and government 
although we have targeted enterprises in these other markets as potential customers  these potential customers may not be as willing to purchase our products as our customers in the electronic and high technology  industrial and life sciences industries have been 
targeting additional industries requires us to invest significant amounts in sales and marketing activities 
if we are unable to expand into other industries and markets  we may not recover this investment 
in addition  if we are not able to expand into other industries  we may be unable to maintain or increase sales of our software 
if we become subject to product liability litigation  it could be time consuming and costly to defend since our products are used for mission critical applications in the supply chain  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other harm to our customers 
for example  our products are designed to communicate information relating to changes in product specifications during the manufacturing process 
if a supplier or other participant receives inaccurate or erroneous data  it is possible that it could claim it incurred damages based on its reliance on that data 
although our license agreements generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability damages  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate such limitation of liability provisions 
while we carry product liability insurance  our insurance may not fully cover these claims 
product liability litigation  even if successfully defended  would be time consuming and costly to defend and could harm our business 

table of contents changes in global business conditions could adversely affect demand for our products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and results of operations our operating results have been adversely affected over the past few years by the reduced levels of capital spending  overall weak economic conditions affecting our current and potential customers and political uncertainties such as the ongoing threat of terrorist strikes 
the economic environment that we faced in fiscal and was uncertain  and that uncertainty continues in fiscal because customers and potential customers are deferring and may continue to defer major infrastructure investments until general economic conditions improve  we may be especially prone to this weak economy  particularly as it relates to large license transactions 
although we have begun to see early evidence of strengthening demand  weak economic conditions may continue to adversely impact our business for at least the new few quarters 
the market for our products is still developing  and there is significant uncertainty as to how rapidly it will grow  if at all  and how large it will become the market for plm software products is still developing 
our customers and potential customers have not traditionally automated product lifecycle management solutions like we offer throughout their supply chains 
as this is a relatively new market  we cannot be certain that this market will continue to develop and grow 
many customers and prospective customers have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing product information during the manufacturing and supply process  most notably internally developed applications 
these customers and prospective customers may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems or methods 
moreover  customers and prospective customers have many competing demands placed on their available information technology budgets 
there can be no assurance that plm in general or agile in particular will compete favorably against other potential uses of information technology spending 
we expect that we will continue to need to pursue intensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products 
along with our direct efforts in these areas  we also rely upon relationships with consulting and integration partners to increase the market awareness of the existence and benefits of our plm solutions 
currently  only a limited number of companies provide this type of market support for our products 
these companies are not contractually obligated to promote our products  and they may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors 
if these service providers reduce or discontinue their relationships with us  market acceptance of our products could be harmed 
as a result of these factors  demand for and market acceptance of our products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if the plm market fails to develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not receive wide acceptance  our ability to grow would be limited 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose a valuable asset  experience reduced market share or incur costly litigation to protect our rights  we may also be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that  with or without merit  could be costly to defend or settle our success and ability to compete depend upon our proprietary technology  particularly the technology underlying our products 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  a third party could copy or otherwise obtain our software or other proprietary information without authorization 
we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our patents  trade secrets or know how or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending intellectual property rights is expensive  could cause the diversion of our resources  and may not prove successful 
our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  and any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose a valuable asset 
in addition  the laws of some countries do not protect our 
table of contents proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor the use of our products as we increase our international presence 
we may  from time to time  be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or claims that our own intellectual property rights are invalid 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that  in the future  third parties may claim that our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce solutions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of plm products begins to overlap with other software applications 
any infringement claims made against us  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or negative publicity 
in addition  if our products were found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to continue to be able to sell our products 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or acceptable at all 
we depend on third party licensed technology that if lost  could result in increased cost or delays in sales of our products we license technology on a non exclusive basis from many companies for use with our products 
we utilize database management software from oracle 
our customers can purchase this software directly from oracle or from us 
in addition  we integrate software into our products licensed from bea and oracle for application server technology  from actuate for reporting capabilities  spicer for document viewing and cognos for analytics  as well as products from several other providers 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
some of the software we license from third parties would be difficult to replace and may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the loss or inability to maintain any of these technology licenses could result in delays in the licensing of our products until equivalent technology is identified  licensed  and integrated 
the increased use of third party software could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation and lower product gross margins 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for individual security holders the market price for our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
during fiscal  the high and low closing sales prices of our common stock were and  respectively 
our stock price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors  some of which will be beyond our control 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if  in addition to the pending litigation discussed elsewhere in which we are currently involved  we are involved in any additional securities class action suits  it could result in further  significant costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources  and could cause the prices of our securities to fall 
legislative action and potential new accounting pronouncements could cause our general and administrative expenses to increase in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as recent changes to listing standards by nasdaq  and rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission  we have had to hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  and may continue to require such additional resources 
these efforts cost million during fiscal  which has caused our general and administrative costs to increase 
moreover  in the rapidly changing regulatory environment in which we now operate  there is significant uncertainty as to what will be required to comply with many of the new rules and regulations 
as a result  we may be required to spend substantially more than we currently estimate  and may need to divert resources from other activities  as we develop our compliance plans 

table of contents provisions contained in our charter documents and in certain anti takeover measures adopted by us may delay or prevent a change in our control provisions of our delaware certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions also may prevent changes in our management 
we are subject to the provision of section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
the combination of these provisions may inhibit a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
further  in march  our board of directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan intended to guard against certain takeover tactics 
the existence of this plan could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock
