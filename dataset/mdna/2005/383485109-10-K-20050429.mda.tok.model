item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors that have affected the company s financial position and its results of operations for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
fiscal  and results all include weeks 
overview the company is a regional department and specialty store chain completing its th year of operation 
as of january   the company operated full line gottschalks department stores located in six western states  with the majority of those stores located in california 
the company also operates village east and gottschalks specialty stores which carry a limited selection of merchandise 
the company s department stores typically offer a wide range of better to moderate brand name and private label merchandise  including mens  womens  juniors and childrens apparel  cosmetics  shoes  fine jewelry and accessories  and home furnishings including china  housewares  domestics  small electric appliances and  in selected locations  furniture and mattresses 
the company s operations are significantly impacted by competitive pressures from department stores  specialty stores  mass merchandisers and other retail channels  as well as general consumer spending levels  including the impact of employment levels and other economic conditions 
such pressures during fiscal were partially offset by promotional activities surrounding the celebration of the company s th anniversary resulting in a marginal increase in comparable store sales for fiscal of as compared to fiscal the company s fiscal acquisition of stores from the former lamont s chain put significant pressure on the company s operating performance and liquidity position 
the company subsequently closed of the acquired stores and charged off the related assets and leasehold intangibles 
in january the company terminated its private label credit card receivables securitization program and sold the accounts and receivables to a third party  resulting in the payoff of million in off balance sheet debt and reduction in outstanding borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit of approximately million 
in march the company amended and extended its revolving line of credit reducing the interest margin paid on outstanding borrowings and replacing certain higher variable interest debt with lower fixed interest debt 
the company was able to reduce its debt by an additional million during fiscal as a result of this strategic repositioning the company has been able to refocus on its marketing and merchandising strategies 
in addition  the company has resumed its raise the bar programs in its existing stores and is beginning to enhance top line growth through new store openings 
on april  the company opened a new  square foot store in albany  oregon and plans to open a  square foot lifestyle store in august in fresno  california 
subsequent to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended january   as a result of views expressed in a letter on february  by the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec to the american institute of certified public accountants regarding certain operating lease related accounting issues and their applications under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  the company determined that its then current manner in which it accounted for certain lease related issues was not in accordance with gaap 
corrections to the company s lease accounting policies include an adjustment to depreciation expense to correct the depreciable lives for certain leasehold improvements  and to correct the recording of certain tenant allowances and construction reimbursements  as reductions in rent expense  which are included in selling general and administration expenses  that had previously been recorded as reductions in the cost of the underlying constructed assets 
in addition  the restatement includes adjusting lease terms of certain leases to include bargain renewal option periods where exercise of the options would be reasonably assured  and recognizing the straight line effect over the lease term of such changes in rents during the option periods 
as a result  the company restated its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended january  and february  accordingly  the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement discussed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company had previously classified newly generated receivables and payments on receivables under the securitization program as investing activities  and classified the gross proceeds from the sale of its proprietary credit card portfolio and the repayment of the and series certificates as financing activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended february  to correct this error  the company has restated its fiscal consolidated statement of cash flows to reflect the change in receivables and the net proceeds received by the company from the sale of its proprietary credit card portfolio as operating activities  since the credit card receivables originated from the sale of the company s merchandise 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to its revenue recognition policy  the carrying value of its merchandise inventories  the adequacy of its store closure reserves  and the valuation of its long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
some of the company s significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than its other accounting policies 
the policies described below have been identified as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policy net retail sales are recognized at the point of sale  net of estimated sales returns and allowances and exclusive of sales tax 
net retail sales also include all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction for shipping and handling  including customer delivery charges 
revenues on special order sales are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer and the merchandise has been paid for in its entirety 
the company records an allowance for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related sale occurs 
these estimates are based primarily on historical sales returns 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  adjustments to the allowance for estimated sales returns may be necessary 
inventory valuation merchandise inventory  which consists of merchandise held for resale  is valued at the lower of lifo last in  first out cost or market using the retail inventory method rim of accounting 
inherent in the rim calculation are various judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as resulting gross margins 
the company applies various methodologies to ensure that the application of the rim is consistent for all periods presented 
such methodologies include the development of consistent cost to retail ratios and the grouping of homogenous classes of merchandise 
estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventory dates is based on historical experience 
should actual inventory shrinkage results differ from the company s estimate  year end revisions to inventory shrinkage expense recognized on an interim basis may be required 
estimating the market value of the company s merchandise inventory requires assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are based on actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels and aging information by merchandise categories 
the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  or if other indicators of impairment are present  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
reserve for store closure costs in the event a store is closed before its lease has expired  the remaining lease obligation after the closing date less anticipated sublease rental income or proceeds from lease settlements  if any is expensed at the date the store ceases operations 
asset impairment charges related to furniture  fixtures and equipment  leasehold improvements  goodwill and leasehold interests are expensed in the period in which management adopts a plan to close the store if impairment is considered likely as a result of such planned closure  or at such other time as impairment becomes likely 
severance and other incremental costs associated with a store closure are expensed as incurred 
as of january   the company had no reserves for store closure costs 
in the event the company decides to close additional store locations in fiscal or beyond  additional reserves for store closure costs  which may be material  may be incurred 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  goodwill  leasehold interests and other long term assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
with respect to store locations  the company performs an evaluation of whether an impairment charge should be recorded whenever a store experiences unfavorable operating performance 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows over its estimated remaining lease term to its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset is recognized 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a variety of factors  including historical experience in similar locations  changes in merchandising  promotional or operating strategy that may affect the profitability of a particular location  knowledge of the market area and in some cases  expected sale proceeds or sublease income  and independent appraisals 
in addition  the analysis assumes that new store locations typically take three years to achieve their full profit potential 
various uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in consumer preferences  increased competition or a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded asset impairment charges in connection with store closures  and such charges are included in loss on store closures in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  asset impairment charges were recorded for certain underperforming store locations which continue to be operated 
if actual performance or fair value estimates for other locations are less favorable than management s projections  future asset impairment charges may be necessary 
similar procedures are used when analyzing other corporate assets for impairment 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the value of these assets 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence for certain tax credit  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards that would likely expire prior to their utilization 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of its remaining net deferred tax assets 
however  if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  resulting in additional income tax expense 
the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement discussed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percent of net sales fiscal years net sales net credit revenues net leased department revenues total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization asset impairment charges store closure costs receivables sale costs total costs and expenses operating income other income expense interest expense losses on early extinguishment of debt miscellaneous income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations income loss from operation of closed stores loss on store closures income tax benefit loss on discontinued operations net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales from continuing operations increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the fiscal sales increase is primarily attributable to promotional activity related to the celebration of the company s th anniversary  but was tempered by a continuing soft general economic environment in much of the company s market areas and additional competitive pressures in the central california markets

the interest only strip represented the portion of the initial revenues under the cca that is considered a residual interest in the assets sold

as expected  the company experienced a substantial decrease in net credit revenues in fiscal as a result of the receivables sale to hsbc  as well as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of outsourcing the credit card servicing to hsbc and a reduction in interest expense arising from reduced line of credit borrowings resulting from the application of the proceeds from the hsbc transaction 
the net credit revenues the company received under the cca approximately equaled the net revenues from its former in house credit card operations  net of operating expenses and interest expense 
net leased department revenues net rental income generated by the company s various leased departments decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to a continued downturn in the general economic environment in much of the company s market areas resulting in lower consumer spending during the first three quarters of the fiscal year

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of the in house credit card operations in connection with the sale of receivables to hsbc and cost reduction efforts initiated throughout all areas of the company  particularly in the areas of payroll and related fringe benefits  reduced advertising expenditures resulting from an increased reliance on more effective targeted marketing efforts partially offset by the change in accounting for certain allowances previously mentioned  and reduced communications costs 
such cost savings were partially offset by increased professional fees and insurance costs 
the company is continuing to implement programs aimed at reducing operating costs throughout all areas of the company 
although the company anticipates it will be successful in achieving its cost reduction initiatives  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully offset the impact of increases in certain of these costs in the future

the ge facility contains restrictive financial and operating covenants  including the requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of as defined in the agreement 
as of january   management believes the company was in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants applicable to the ge facility 
trade credit and transactions with affiliate the success of the company s business is highly dependent upon the adequacy of trade credit offered by key factors and vendors  the vendors ability and willingness to sell it products at favorable prices and terms  and the willingness of vendors to ship merchandise on a timely basis 
the company has been able to purchase adequate levels of merchandise to support its operations and expects the level of trade credit to be sufficient to support its operations in the foreseeable future 
restrictions to the amount of trade credit granted by key factors and vendors can adversely impact the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase 
any significant reduction in the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase  or a prolonged disruption in the timing of when merchandise is received  would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  liquidity position  and results of operations 
due to low liquidity levels during fiscal and unsecured credit granted by key factors  which can represent over of total trade credit granted to the company  was restricted 
management negotiated the restoration of partially secured credit lines with certain key factors by issuing standby letters of credit 
the issuance of those letters of credit reduced the company s borrowing availability under its revolving line of credit 
in order to offset the majority of this availability reduction  the harris company  a subsidiary of el corte ingles and an affiliate of the company  agreed to provide a short term credit enhancement to the revolving line of credit under the terms of a credit facilitation agreement the cfa entered into with the company on february  the cfa was terminated as a result of the closing of the sale of receivables to hsbc 
as a result of continued improvements in the company s operations and liquidity position  including sale of receivables to hsbc and the march  renegotiation of the ge facility  all of the letters of credit issued for the benefit of certain key factors have been allowed to expire and unsecured credit lines with all of the company s key factors and many of the company s unfactored suppliers are sufficient to provide an adequate level of merchandise to support the company s operations 
other financings on february   the company amended and extended the financing of its ownership interest in the partnership that owns the company s corporate headquarters building 
the related note payable of million  which originally provided for interest only payments at a variable rate of interest of prime plus per annum  and was due in full upon maturity on may   has been modified to a fully amortizing note bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum and maturing on february  there is no prepayment penalty associated with the note 
the company may consider various other sources of liquidity in the future  including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities that might have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders or incurring additional indebtedness which would increase the company s leverage 
uses of liquidity the company s primary uses of liquidity are for working capital  debt service requirements and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in fiscal  totaling million  were primarily related to the renovation  refixturing  and expansion of certain existing locations  and to certain information system enhancements 
in july of fiscal the company entered into an agreement to open one new concept store in the river park area of fresno  california

on april  the company also opened a new store in albany  oregon at a total cost to the company of approximately million 
as of january   the company had issued a total of million of standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit totaling million 
the standby letters of credit were issued to provide collateral for workers compensation insurance policies 
management believes that the likelihood of any draws under the remaining workers compensation standby letters of credit is remote 
documentary letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business to facilitate the purchase of merchandise from overseas suppliers 
the supplier draws against the documentary letter of credit upon delivery of the merchandise

 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under the provisions of this statement  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include retrospective and prospective adoption methods 
under the retrospective method  prior periods may be restated based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for all periods presented or as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of this statement  for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas  for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date 
the provisions of this statement are effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the company is currently evaluating the requirements of this revision and has not determined its method of adoption

inflation although inflation has not been a material factor in the company s operations during the past several years  the company has experienced increases in the costs of certain merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs  including utilities  health care and workers compensation and property and casualty insurance costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company values its merchandise inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail inventory method of accounting 
under the lifo method  which is determined by using the department store price indices published by the bureau of labor statistics  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation due to increasing costs on reported income 
the valuation of the company s merchandise inventories under the lifo method is currently equal to that as determined by the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating income realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and  to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility 
as of january   the company also had one term loan bearing variable interest rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes  nor does the company purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
as of january   borrowings subject to a variable interest rate  represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings 
the interest payable on the company s senior revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing floating rate borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of january  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately million 
this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments
