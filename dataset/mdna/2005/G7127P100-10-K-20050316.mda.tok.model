overview platinum underwriters holdings  ltd 
platinum holdings is a bermuda holding company organized in platinum holdings and its subsidiaries the company operate through three licensed reinsurance subsidiaries platinum underwriters reinsurance  inc platinum us  platinum re uk limited platinum uk and platinum underwriters bermuda  ltd 
platinum bermuda 
the company provides property and marine  casualty and finite risk reinsurance coverages  through reinsurance intermediaries  to a diverse clientele of insurers and select reinsurers on a worldwide basis 
in november  platinum holdings completed the initial public offering 
concurrent with the initial public offering  platinum holdings sold  common shares to the st 
paul travelers companies  inc  formerly the st 
paul companies  inc  st 
paul  and  common shares to renaissancere holdings ltd 
renaissancere in private placements 
as part of the public offering  st 
paul and renaissancere received options to purchase up to  and  of additional common shares  respectively  at any time during the ten years following the initial public offering at a price of per share 
st 
paul subsequently sold its  common shares in june also  concurrent with the transactions in november  the company and st 
paul entered into several agreements for the transfer of continuing reinsurance business and certain related assets of st 
paul 
among these agreements were quota share retrocession agreements effective november  under which the company assumed from st 
paul unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  unearned premiums and certain other liabilities on reinsurance contracts becoming effective in the quota share retrocession agreements 
in addition to these transactions  the company issued equity security units esu s  consisting of a contract to purchase common shares in and an ownership interest in a senior note due critical accounting policies it is important to understand the company s accounting policies in order to understand its financial position and results of operations 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the relevant periods 
certain of the estimates and assumptions result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s most critical accounting policies involve written and unearned premium  unpaid losses and lae  reinsurance  investments  income taxes and stock based compensation 
premiums assumed reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues when premiums become earned proportionately over the coverage period 
net premiums earned are recorded in the statement of income  net of the cost of retrocession 
net premiums written not yet recognized as revenue are recorded on the balance sheet as unearned premiums  gross of any ceded unearned premiums 
due to the nature of reinsurance  ceding companies routinely report and remit premiums subsequent to the contract coverage period 
consequently  reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by the ceding companies  supplemented by estimates of premiums that are written but not reported wbnr 
in addition to estimating wbnr  the company estimates the portion of premium earned but not reported ebnr 
the company also estimates the expenses associated with these premiums in the form of losses  lae and commissions 
as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies  management evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates and any adjustments to these estimates are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and could significantly impact earnings in the period they are recorded 
due to the time lag inherent in the reporting of premiums by ceding companies  a significant portion of amounts included as premiums written and premiums receivable represents estimated premiums  net of commissions  and are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the loss experience under the contracts 
reinstatement premiums and additional premiums are recognized in accordance with the provisions of assumed reinsurance contracts  based on loss experience under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of a reinsurance contract to its full amount  generally coinciding with the payment by the reinsurer of losses 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained for the remainder of the initial policy term and are earned over the remaining policy term 
additional premiums are those premiums triggered by losses and not related to reinstatement of limits and are earned immediately 
an allowance for uncollectible premiums is established for possible non payment of such amounts due  as deemed necessary 
unpaid losses and lae the most significant judgment made by management in the preparation of financial statements is the estimation of unpaid losses and lae  also referred to as loss reserves 
these liabilities are balance sheet estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and lae for reinsured claims which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
every quarter  the company s actuaries prepare estimates of the loss reserves based on established actuarial techniques 
because the ultimate amount of unpaid losses and lae is uncertain  we believe that quantitative techniques to estimate these amounts are enhanced by professional and managerial judgment 
company management reviews these estimates and determines its best estimate of the liabilities to record in the company s financial statements 
unpaid losses and lae include estimates of the cost of claims that were reported but not yet paid case reserves and the cost of claims that were incurred but not reported ibnr 
case reserves are usually based upon claim reports received from ceding companies  and may be increased or reduced by the company s claims personnel 
ibnr is based on actuarial methods including the loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method and the chain ladder method 
ibnr related to a specific event may be based on the company s estimated exposure to an industry loss and may include the use of catastrophe modeling software 
generally  initial actuarial estimates of ibnr not related to a specific event are based on the loss ratio method applied to each underwriting year for each class of business 
actual paid losses and case reserves reported losses are subtracted from expected ultimate losses to determine ibnr 
the initial expected ultimate losses involve management judgment and are based on i contract by contract expected loss ratios derived from the company s pricing process  and ii historical loss ratios of the company and st 
paul re adjusted for rate changes and trends 
these judgments will take into account management s view of past  current and future i market conditions  ii changes in the business underwritten  iii changes in timing of the emergence of claims and iv other factors that may influence expected ultimate losses 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported  actuarial estimates of ibnr are based on the bornhuetter ferguson and the chain ladder techniques 
the bornhuetter ferguson technique utilizes actual reported losses and expected patterns of reported losses  taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine a new estimate of expected ultimate losses 
this technique is most appropriate when there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses 
the chain ladder technique utilizes actual reported losses and expected patterns of reported losses to determine a new estimate of expected ultimate losses that is independent of the initial expected ultimate losses 
this technique is most appropriate when there are a large number of reported losses with significant statistical credibility and a relatively stable pattern of reported losses 
the pattern of reported losses is determined utilizing actuarial analysis  including management s judgment  and is based on historical patterns of the recording of paid losses and case reserves to the company  as well as industry patterns 
information that may cause historical patterns to differ from future patterns is considered and reflected in expected patterns as appropriate 
for property and health coverages these patterns indicate that a substantial portion of the ultimate losses are reported within to years after the contract is effective 
casualty patterns can vary from years to over years depending on the type of business 
while the company commenced operations in  the business written is sufficiently similar to the historical business of st 
paul re that the company uses the historical loss experience of this business to estimate its initial expected ultimate losses and its expected patterns of reported losses 
these patterns can span more than a decade and  given its own limited history  the availability of the st 
paul re data is a valuable asset to the company 
we do not establish liabilities until the occurrence of an event that may give rise to a loss 
when an event of sufficient magnitude occurs  we may establish a specific ibnr reserve 
generally  this involves a catastrophe occurrence that affects many ceding companies 
ultimate losses and lae are based on management s judgment that reflects estimates gathered from ceding companies  estimates of insurance industry losses gathered from public sources and estimates from catastrophe modeling software 
estimated amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires on unpaid losses and lae are determined based on the company s estimate of ultimate losses and lae and the terms and conditions of its retrocessional contracts 
these amounts are reflected as assets 
unpaid losses and lae represent management s best estimates  at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred  and it is possible that the ultimate liability may materially differ from such estimates 
such estimates are not precise because  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors 
the uncertainty inherent in loss estimation is particularly pronounced for casualty coverages  such as umbrella liability  general and product liability  professional liability  directors and officers liability and automobile liability  where information  such as required medical treatment and costs for bodily injury claims  only emerges over time 
in the overall loss reserving process  provisions for economic inflation and changes in the social and legal environment are considered 
the uncertainty inherent in the reserving process for primary insurers is even greater for the reinsurer 
this is because of  but not limited to  the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to the reinsurer and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
estimates of unpaid losses and lae are periodically re estimated and adjusted as new information becomes available 
any such adjustments are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made 
reinsurance premiums written  premiums earned and losses and lae reflect the net effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions 
reinsurance accounting is followed for assumed and ceded transactions when risk transfer requirements have been met 
evaluating risk transfer involves significant assumptions relating to the amount and timing of expected cash flows  as well as the interpretation of underlying contract terms 
reinsurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are generally accounted for as reinsurance deposit liabilities with interest expense charged to other income and credited to the liability 
investments in accordance with our investment guidelines  our investments consist largely of high grade marketable fixed income securities 
fixed maturities owned that the company may not have the positive intent to hold until maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes 
fixed maturities owned that the company has the intent to sell prior to maturity are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in other income 
securities classified as trading securities are generally denominated in foreign currencies and intended to match foreign net liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in order to minimize net exposures arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
investment income is recorded when earned and includes the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments 
the company believes it has the ability to hold any specific security to maturity 
this is based on current and anticipated future positive cash flow from operations that generates sufficient liquidity in order to meet our obligations 
however  in the course of managing investment credit risk  asset liability duration or other aspects of the investment portfolio  the company may decide to sell any specific security 
the company routinely reviews its available for sale investments to determine whether unrealized losses represent temporary changes in fair value or are the result of other than temporary impairments 
the process of determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired is subjective and involves analyzing many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the length and magnitude of an unrealized loss  specific credit events  the overall financial condition of the issuer  and the company s intent to hold a security for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover the unrealized loss 
if the company has determined that an unrealized loss on a security is other than temporary  the company writes down the carrying value of the security to its current fair value and records a realized loss in the statement of income 
during and as of december   the company s investment portfolio does not contain any securities that were determined to have other than temporary impairments 
income taxes platinum holdings and platinum bermuda are domiciled in bermuda 
under current bermuda law  they are not taxed on any bermuda income or capital gains and they have received an undertaking from the bermuda minister of finance that  in the event of any bermuda income or capital gains taxes being imposed  they will be exempt from those taxes until the company also has subsidiaries in the united states  united kingdom and ireland that are subject to the tax laws thereof 
the company applies the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized 
stock based compensation during  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for awards of stock based compensation to employees sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas requires that the fair value of shares granted under the company s share option plan subsequent to adoption of sfas be amortized in earnings over the vesting periods 
the fair value of the share options granted is determined through the use of an option pricing model 
sfas amends sfas and provides transitioning guidance for a voluntary adoption of fas as well as amends the disclosure requirements of sfas for the period from november  through december   the company used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees established by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  if the exercise price of the company s employee share options is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
for share options granted in  the company continues to use apb in december  the financial accounting standards board issued the statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that  prospectively  compensation costs be recognized for the fair value of all share options  including the costs related to the unvested portion of all outstanding share options as of december  the share based compensation expense for share options currently outstanding are to be based on the same cost model used to calculate the pro forma disclosures under sfas consequently  the pro forma share based compensation expense and pro forma income as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are the same as if the company had adopted sfas r in reinsurance industry conditions and trends the reinsurance industry historically has been cyclical  characterized by periods of price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods of favorable pricing due to shortages of underwriting capacity 
cyclical trends in the industry and the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile developments  including natural and other disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions and other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  the frequency and severity of which are inherently difficult to predict 
property and casualty reinsurance rates often rise in the aftermath of significant catastrophe losses 
to the extent that actual claim liabilities are higher than anticipated  the industry s capacity to write new business diminishes 
the industry is also affected by changes in the propensity of courts to expand insurance coverage and grant large liability awards  as well as fluctuations in interest rates  inflation and other changes in the economic environment that affect market prices of investments 
as a result of favorable loss development and strong investment returns beginning in the mid s  the reinsurance industry entered a cycle of increased competition and industry capacity that pushed property and casualty premium rates down 
in  there were several significant worldwide catastrophic events that resulted in industry insured losses of approximately billion 
these losses  and the subsequent contraction of reinsurance capacity in the market  resulted in improvements in rates  terms and conditions beginning with january renewals 
these improvements continued in as capacity continued to contract due to a number of catastrophe events  particularly the terrorist attack of september  with insured losses currently estimated to be in excess of billion  the terrorist attack resulted in the largest insured loss ever experienced by the industry 
by comparison  the largest industry insured catastrophic event prior to the attack was hurricane andrew in with billion in estimated losses 
shortly after the property catastrophe events of and  many reinsurance companies began to recognize poor results in their casualty business stemming from business underwritten from to the result was substantial loss reserve charges summing to tens of billions of dollars and a further decrease in industry capacity 
in addition  the capital of a number of large companies was further reduced by poor investment results 
in late and through several new companies were started 
some existing companies raised new capital and others exited the business 
the new capital invested in the industry was substantially less than the capital reductions caused by losses  exiting companies and poor investment results 
as a result  rate increases in were significantly higher than rates on most lines of business still increased in though at a lower rate of increase than in recent competition has led to lower rate increases and or rate reductions in certain property and casualty classes in despite the florida and caribbean catastrophe claims in the third quarter of  property rate reductions still occurred 
nonetheless  we believe rates should provide adequate returns 
results of operations platinum holdings was incorporated on april  under the laws of bermuda to hold subsidiaries that provide property and casualty reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers on a worldwide basis and  in november  completed the initial public offering and assumed certain rights and obligations of the reinsurance business from st 
paul 
consequently  the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  shareholders equity and cash flows include all activity from incorporation on april  through december  the underwriting operations  as well as substantially all other operations of the company commenced in november generally  the results of operations reflect the period from november  through december  the period and are not comparable to the results of operations for the years ended december  and year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  net income for the years ended december  and was as follows in thousands decrease net income    the decrease in net income in as compared with is attributable to a decline in underwriting income of  the decline in underwriting income was due primarily to the combination of four significant named hurricanes  charley  frances  ivan and jeanne the hurricanes  causing severe damage in the caribbean and the southeast united states in august and september of  partially offset by growth of profitable business in all segments and favorable loss development 
net income in as compared with was also favorably impacted by an increase in investment income of  and reductions in corporate expenses of  and income tax expense of the aggregate adverse impact on net income of the company in from the hurricanes is summarized as follows in thousands losses  less additional premiums earned  profit commissions  net adverse impact before income tax benefit  income tax benefit  net adverse impact after income tax benefit  the impact of the hurricanes was consistent with our expectations for storms of this magnitude and location 
net premiums written and net premiums earned for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase net premiums written    net premiums earned    the increase in net premiums written and earned in as compared with is attributable to growth in all segments  and includes approximately  of additional premiums related to losses arising from the hurricanes 
the increase in net premiums earned is related to the growth in current and prior periods net premiums written and is affected by changes in the mix of business and the structure of the underlying reinsurance contracts 
net investment income for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
net investment income increased during primarily due to increased invested assets attributable to positive cash flow from operations  excluding trading securities activities  which was  and  in and  respectively 
fixed maturities were  and  at december  and  respectively 
the book basis yields on fixed maturities were and at december  and  respectively 
net investment income included  and  of interest earned on funds held for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net investment income for the year ended december  included  of interest received from st 
paul on balances due relating to the quota share retrocession agreements 
net realized gains on investments of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  were the result of investment sale activity to manage the quality  diversity  currency exposure  duration and tax profile of the investment portfolio 
other income for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
other income in includes  of net unrealized gains relating to changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading   of earnings on reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits and a gain of  on the sale of assets 
other income in includes  of net unrealized losses relating to changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading and   of earnings on reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits 
earnings on reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits decreased in from due to a fewer number of such contracts 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the company routinely does business in various foreign currencies 
the decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses is due to efforts to better manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by holding invested assets denominated in the foreign currencies in which the related net insurance liabilities are denominated 
the company periodically reviews its largest foreign currency exposures and purchases or sells foreign currency denominated invested assets to match these exposures 
losses and lae and the resulting loss and lae ratios for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase losses and lae    losses and lae ratios points the increase in losses and lae in from is due primarily to losses of approximately  from the hurricanes and the growth in business in all segments 
the increase in the loss ratio in from is due primarily to losses from the hurricanes that contributed to the loss and lae ratio in net favorable development of  reduced the loss and lae ratio by in as compared with favorable development of  that reduced the loss and lae ratio by in acquisition expenses and resulting acquisition expense ratios for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease acquisition expenses    acquisition expense ratios points the increase in acquisition expenses in from is consistent with the growth in business in all segments  partially offset by reductions of profit commissions under reinsurance contracts that incurred losses from the hurricanes 
the decrease in the acquisition expense ratio in from is primarily due to changes in the mix of business as well as reductions of profit commissions related to losses from the hurricanes 
operating expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
operating expenses include costs such as salaries  rent and like items related to reinsurance operations as well as costs associated with platinum holdings 
the decline of  in operating expenses in as compared with was attributable to a reduction of  in incentive based compensation in as compared with due to the decline in the company s net income  a charge of  in related to the separation and consulting agreement with the company s former chief executive officer  as well as various non recurring start up costs of approximately  incurred in interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  and relates to the company s esu s  which are classified as debt obligations on the company s balance sheet 
income taxes and the effective income tax rate for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease income taxes    effective income tax rate points income taxes decreased in from due to the decline in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate in any given year is based on income before taxes of the company s subsidiaries that operate in several jurisdictions with varying corporate income tax rates 
platinum holdings and platinum bermuda are not subject to corporate income tax 
while the effective income tax rates in and are comparable  both years include events that increased the effective income tax rate 
in approximately of the losses from the hurricanes were incurred by platinum bermuda without tax benefit and in expenses related to the severance payment to and share option expense of the company s former chief executive officer were incurred by platinum holdings without tax benefit 
year ended december  as compared with the period ended december  net income for the year ended december  and the period was as follows in thousands period increase net income    the company s first complete year of operations was and  consequently  net income increased significantly as compared with the period which represents a two month period during which the company had minimal underwriting activity 
additional factors affecting the comparison include the growth in the business underwritten in over  favorable development in of unpaid losses and lae of approximately  improved profitability relating to net premiums earned in  and increased investment income resulting from growth in invested assets in the united states insurance industry incurred some significant catastrophe losses in  however  catastrophe losses in the company s portfolio were relatively low as most catastrophe claims remained at the primary or ceding company level 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include a charge of  for expenses related to the separation and consulting agreement with the company s former chief executive officer 
net premiums written and earned for the year ended december  and the period was as follows in thousands period increase net premiums written    net premiums earned    the company s first complete year of operations was and  as a result  net premiums written and earned increased significantly as compared with the period which represents a two month period during which the company had minimal underwriting activity 
generally  the last two months of a year have a relatively small amount of net premiums written 
however  net premiums written in the period include  of unearned premiums assumed from st 
paul under the quota share retrocession agreements representing the remaining unearned premiums related to contracts written by st 
paul re during the first ten months of premiums written are based partially on estimates of ultimate premiums from reinsurance contracts and the estimates are updated quarterly 
reductions in premiums estimated for the underwriting year in the casualty segment  a portion of which was written and earned by st 
paul re  reduced the company s net premiums written in by approximately  similar to net premiums written  net premiums earned in represents twelve months of underwriting activity whereas the period represents two months 
net premiums earned are recognized subsequent to net premiums written 
net premiums earned in the period are relatively low due to the commencement of operations during net premiums earned for reflect business underwritten in and while net premiums earned in the period reflect only business underwritten in the reduction in of net premiums written in the casualty segment resulted in a reduction of net premiums earned of approximately  net investment income was  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the comparison of with twelve months of investment income to the period 
net investment income increased during as the company s invested assets increased as a result of positive cash flow from operations 
net realized gains on investments were  and  in and the period  respectively  and are the result of investment sale activity to manage the quality  diversity  currency exposure  duration and tax profile of the investment portfolio 
other income was  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively  and represents earnings on a small number of reinsurance contracts in the finite risk segment accounted for as deposits 
other income in also includes  of net unrealized losses relating to changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses for the year ended december  and the period  were  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses arise from the valuation in us dollars of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
during  the company established procedures to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by matching foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
losses and lae for the years ended december  and the period  respectively were as follows in thousands increase period decrease losses and lae    losses and lae ratio points the increase in losses and lae is primarily due to the comparison of with twelve months of underwriting operations to the period 
losses and lae in were favorably impacted by improved profitability relating to net premiums earned in on business underwritten in while losses and lae in include provisions for various catastrophe losses  the period had no catastrophe losses 
the united states insurance industry incurred some significant catastrophe losses in however  catastrophe losses in the company s portfolio were relatively low as most catastrophe claims remained at the primary or ceding company level 
losses and lae in included a reduction in the estimated liability as of december  of  of which  relates to the reduction in of premiums originally estimated and earned in in the casualty segment 
the remaining  represents net favorable development 
unpaid losses and lae at december  were based largely on initial expected ultimate loss ratios 
throughout actual reported losses were monitored against expected patterns of reported loss 
as actual reported losses continued to be less than expected reported losses  estimates of expected ultimate losses were reduced 
this principally affected property coverages in the property and marine and finite risk segments where a substantial portion of the ultimate losses is expected to be reported to the company within two years 
acquisition expenses  including brokerage  commissions and other direct underwriting expenses associated with underwriting activities  and resulting acquisition expense ratios for the year ended december  and the period were as follows in thousands increase period decrease acquisition expenses    acquisition expense ratio points the increase in acquisition expenses is primarily due to the comparison of with twelve months of underwriting operations to the period 
although acquisition ratios in varied by operating segment and by type of business  the resulting ratios of acquisition expenses to net premiums earned for and the period were comparable at and  respectively 
operating expenses include other underwriting expenses related to the reinsurance operations as well as costs associated with the holding company operations of platinum holdings and were  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses is due to the comparison of with twelve months of operations to the period 
additionally there were increases in staff  fees relating to the services and capacity reservation agreement dated november  with renaissancere the renre agreement that provides for a periodic review of aggregate property catastrophe exposures by renaissancere and office relocation expenses in operating expenses in include a charge of  for the expenses related to the separation and consulting agreement with the company s former chief executive officer 
operating expenses in the period include one time expenses of  incurred in connection with the completion of the initial public offering  the formation of the company and the assumption of business from st 
paul 
interest expense for the year ended december  and the period was  and  respectively  and relates to amounts payable under the company s esu s which are classified as debt obligations on the company s balance sheet 
the increase is due to the comparison of with twelve months of interest expense to the period 
income taxes and the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  and the period were as follows in thousands increase period decrease income taxes    effective income tax rate points the increase in income tax expense is due to the increase in net income before taxes in over the period 
the effective tax rate for was affected by a significant amount of income derived from business underwritten in  which was assumed and retained by platinum us and subject to us corporate tax 
the effective tax rate for was also affected by expenses related to the separation and consulting agreement with the company s former chief executive officer that were incurred by platinum holdings without tax benefit  thereby increasing the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate in the period was higher than any tax rate of the taxable jurisdictions in which the company operates due to significant start up expenses incurred by platinum holdings for which no tax benefit was available 
segment information the company conducts its worldwide reinsurance business through three operating segments property and marine  casualty and finite risk 
in managing the company s operating segments  management uses measures such as underwriting income and underwriting ratios to evaluate segment performance 
management does not allocate by segment its assets or certain income and expenses such as investment income  interest expense and certain corporate expenses 
segment underwriting income is reconciled to income before income taxes 
the measures used by management in evaluating the company s operating segments should not be used as a substitute for measures determined under us gaap

year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase net premiums written    net premiums earned    net premiums written and earned increased in  as compared with  due to growth across all property classes 
the increase in net premiums written is also the result of a more efficient use of catastrophe capacity through enhanced modeling capabilities  an increase of property pro rata business and a transfer of catastrophe capacity from the finite risk segment to the property and marine segment 
net premiums written and earned also include approximately  of additional premiums from reinsurance contracts that incurred losses arising from the hurricanes 
losses and lae and the resulting loss ratios for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase losses and lae    losses and lae ratio points the increase in losses and lae and the related losses and lae ratio in is due to losses of  from the hurricanes as compared with the low level of catastrophe losses in also contributing to the increase in losses and lae in as compared with is the growth in business 
partially offsetting the increased losses and lae relating to the hurricanes is approximately  of favorable development of prior years unpaid losses and lae in as compared with approximately  of favorable development in during and  actual reported losses were significantly less than expected for the short tailed non catastrophe property lines resulting in reductions in estimated ultimate losses 
acquisition expenses and resulting acquisition expense ratios for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase acquisition expenses    acquisition expense ratio point the increase in acquisition expenses in as compared with is consistent with the growth in business 
the increase in the acquisition expense ratio is primarily due to profit commissions related to the favorable development of non catastrophe losses and lae and changes in the mix of business 
other underwriting expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in other underwriting expenses is due to cost reductions in the property and marine segment in  the reduction of incentive based compensation in  as well as various non recurring start up costs incurred in other underwriting expenses for the years ended december  and include fees of  and  respectively  relating to the renre agreement 
year ended december  as compared with the period ended december  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  and the period were as follows in thousands period increase net premiums written    net premiums earned    the company s first complete year of operations was as compared with the period which represents a two month period during which the company had minimal underwriting activity 
consequently  net premiums written and earned increased by  and  respectively 
net premiums written in the period include  of premiums assumed from st 
paul under the quota share retrocession agreements representing unearned premiums related to contracts written by st

casualty the casualty operating segment includes reinsurance treaties that principally cover umbrella liability  general and product liability  professional liability  workers compensation  casualty clash  automobile liability  surety and trade credit 
this operating segment also includes accident and health treaties  which are predominantly reinsurance of health insurance products 
this operating segment generated  and of the company s net premiums written for the years ended december  and and the period  respectively 
the percentage in the period was impacted by the unearned premiums assumed from st

year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase net premiums written    net premiums earned    the increase in premiums written and earned is due to the growth in contracts bound in both and and rate increases in certain lines of business in that together generate net premiums written in the company continues to expand its treaty participation with existing clients and form new client relationships 
additionally  in the company expanded its participation in surety and trade credit business 
in response to deteriorating market conditions in in the directors and officers liability line of business  the company has begun to significantly decrease its involvement in that line 
also  increases in premiums written were offset by revisions of estimates of casualty premiums that resulted in reductions of net premiums written and earned in of approximately  and  respectively  as compared with similar reductions of net premiums written and earned in of  and  respectively 
the revisions to estimates are based on reported premiums from ceding companies and revised projections of ultimate premiums written under reinsurance contracts 
the net effect on underwriting income of the revisions of estimates  after related reductions in losses  lae and acquisitions expenses  was not significant 
the increase in net premium earned is related to and consistent with the increase in net premiums written and is affected by changes in the mix of business and the structure of the underlying reinsurance contracts

finite risk the finite risk operating segment includes principally structured reinsurance contracts with ceding companies whose needs may not be met efficiently through traditional reinsurance products 
the classes of risks underwritten through finite risk contracts are generally consistent with the classes covered by traditional products 
typically  the amount of claims we might pay is finite or capped 
in return for this limit on claims  we often accept a cap on the potential profit margin specified in the treaty and return profits above this margin to the ceding company 
the three main categories of finite risk contracts are finite quota share  multi year excess of loss and whole account aggregate stop loss 
this operating segment generated  and of the company s net premiums written for the years ended december  and and the period  respectively 
due to the direct inter relationship between losses and commissions for this segment  the company believes it is important to evaluate the overall combined ratio  rather than its component parts of loss and loss adjustment expense ratios 
year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase net premiums written    net premiums earned    the increase in net premiums written and net premiums earned is primarily attributable to several large capped quota share contracts that were written in net premiums earned are related to current and prior periods net premiums written and are affected by changes in the mix of business and the structure of the underlying reinsurance contracts 
net premiums written and earned also include approximately  of additional premiums from reinsurance contracts that incurred losses arising from the hurricanes

   losses  lae and acquisition expenses ratio points the increase in losses  lae and acquisition expenses and the losses  lae and acquisition expense ratio in as compared with is primarily due to losses of  from the hurricanes  partially offset by a reduction in profit commissions of  there were no catastrophe losses in in addition  several capped quota share contracts were written in that included primarily casualty business as compared with business written in that included a higher percentage of finite property business with lower loss ratios 
favorable development impacting both losses and lae and acquisition expenses occurred in both and net favorable development in and amounted to  and  respectively 
other underwriting expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in other underwriting expenses is due to cost reductions in the finite risk segment in  the reduction of incentive based compensation in  as well as various non recurring start up costs incurred in year ended december  as compared with the period ended december  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  and the period were as follows in thousands period increase net premiums written    net premiums earned    the company s first complete year of operations was as compared with the period which represents a two month period during which the company had minimal underwriting activity 
consequently  net premiums written and net premiums earned increased by  and  respectively 
the finite risk portfolio consists of a small number of contracts which can be large in premium size and are written on an intermittent basis 
consequently net premiums written are expected to vary significantly from year to year 
a few significant finite quota share treaties were underwritten in the latter part of and early that together produced net premiums written of  in similar to net premiums written  net premiums earned in includes twelve months of underwriting activity whereas the net premiums earned in the period includes two months

platinum holdings is a holding company that conducts no reinsurance operations of its own 
all of its reinsurance operations are conducted through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries platinum us  platinum uk and platinum bermuda 
as a holding company  the cash flow of platinum holdings consists primarily of dividends  interest and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries 
platinum holdings depends on such payments for general corporate purposes and to meet its obligations  including the contract adjustment payments related to the esu s and the payment of any dividends to its shareholders 
the company has filed an unallocated universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec  which the sec declared effective on april  the securities registered under the shelf registration statement for possible future sales include up to  of common shares  preferred shares and various types of debt securities 
the registration statement included common shares held by st

the company did not sell any common shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common shares by st paul 
the company issued the esus in november  which consist of a contract to purchase common shares from the company in the purchase contracts and an ownership interest in a senior note due issued by platinum finance the senior notes 
during  the company expects to issue common shares in accordance with the purchase contracts and remarket the senior notes  which the company expects to generate cash of approximately  less fees and expenses associated with the remarketing 
liquidity requirements the principal consolidated cash requirements of the company are the payment of losses and lae  commissions  brokerages  operating expenses  dividends to its shareholders  the servicing of debt including interest payments on the senior notes and contract adjustment payments on the purchase contracts included in the company s esu s  the acquisition of and investment in businesses  capital expenditures  premiums retroceded and taxes 
the contract adjustment payments will cease upon issuance of the common shares in accordance with the purchase contracts 
platinum uk and platinum bermuda are not licensed  approved or accredited as reinsurers anywhere in the united states and therefore  under the terms of most of their contracts with united states ceding companies  they are required to provide collateral to these ceding companies for unpaid ceded liabilities in a form acceptable to state insurance commissioners 
typically  this type of collateral takes the form of a letter of credit issued by an acceptable bank  the establishment of a trust  or a cash advance 
platinum uk and platinum bermuda expect to obtain letters of credit through commercial banks and may be required to provide the banks with a security interest in certain of platinum uk s and platinum bermuda s investments 
as of december    of unsecured letters of credit were issued to various cedants 
platinum us and platinum bermuda have reinsurance and other contracts that require them to provide collateral to ceding companies should certain events occur  such as a decline in the rating by am best below specified levels or a decline in statutory equity below specified amounts  or when certain levels of assumed liabilities are attained 
some reinsurance contracts also have special termination provisions that permit early termination should certain events occur 
as of december   investments with a carrying value of  and cash and cash equivalents of  were held in trust and an unsecured letter of credit of  was issued to satisfy these requirements 
platinum us is obligated to collateralize the liabilities assumed from st 
paul under the quota share retrocession agreements

the payment of dividends and other distributions from the company s regulated reinsurance subsidiaries is limited by applicable laws and statutory requirements of the jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate  including bermuda  the united states and the united kingdom 
based on the regulatory restrictions of the applicable jurisdictions  the maximum amount available for payment of dividends or other distributions by the reinsurance subsidiaries of the company in without prior regulatory approval is estimated to be on august   the board of directors of the company approved a plan to purchase up to  of its common shares 
during the year ended december  the company purchased  of its common shares in the open market at an aggregate amount of  at a weighted average price of per share 
the shares purchased by the company were canceled 
management believes that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of the company s subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for the company to meet its liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to the company may be influenced by a variety of factors  including economic conditions in general and in the insurance and reinsurance markets  legal and regulatory changes as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience and the presence or absence of large catastrophic events 
if the company s liquidity needs accelerate beyond our ability to fund such obligations from current operating cash flows  the company may need to liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio or raise additional capital in the capital markets 
the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs by selling investments or raising additional capital is subject to the timing and pricing risks inherent in the capital markets 
economic conditions periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct effect on the company s underwriting operations 
significant unexpected inflationary or recessionary periods can  however  impact the company s underwriting operations and investment portfolio 
management considers the potential impact of economic trends in the estimation process for establishing unpaid losses and lae 
capital expenditures none of platinum holdings  platinum us  platinum uk or platinum bermuda has any material commitments for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years equity security units   operating leases      gross unpaid losses and lae      see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there are generally no stated amounts related to reinsurance contracts 
both the amounts and timing of future loss and lae payments are estimates and subject to the inherent variability of legal and market conditions affecting the obligations and make the timing of cash outflows uncertain 
the ultimate amount and timing of unpaid losses and lae could differ materially from the amounts in the table above 
further  the gross unpaid losses and lae do not represent all of the obligations that will arise under the contracts  but rather only the estimated liability incurred through december  there are reinsurance contracts that have terms extending into under which additional obligations will be incurred 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any arrangements that are not accounted for or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
current outlook we expect that terms and conditions on most reinsurance treaties will remain acceptable to reinsurers  while rate level adequacy will decline thereby reducing expected profitability 
given our strategy of underwriting for profitability  not market share  a decline in expected treaty profitability may eventually result in lower net written premium 
we anticipate that our total net premium written in will be approximately the same as for if rates deteriorate more quickly than we anticipate  then our net written premium will likely be lower than the level 
for the property and marine segment underlying primary rates are declining at a rapid pace for commercial properties in the us and abroad rendering some proportional business unattractive in light of the catastrophe risks assumed 
the level of rate increase in florida that will be allowed by regulators for residential properties is not currently known and may not be sufficient to compensate for the perceived riskiness of the business 
consequently  our level of business written on a proportional basis may decline as compared to to the extent that excess of loss reinsurance rates adjust to partially mitigate the negative impact of underlying rate decreases we are more likely to renew this business and therefore anticipate premium volume for that is substantially similar to with selective and disciplined underwriting  we believe that the business we accept will generate acceptable profitability 
for the casualty segment  we believe that differences of opinion between primary insurers and reinsurers regarding the profitability of the casualty business will persist 
accordingly  we anticipate that well capitalized primary carriers will retain more of their business 
less well capitalized carriers may seek reinsurance with more restrictions on risk transfer to drive down costs 
although the overall quantity of casualty reinsurance ceded may decrease in versus  we believe that our strong capitalization and reputation as a lead casualty reinsurer will allow us to write approximately the same level of premium for as for at good levels of expected profitability provided that rate levels do not deteriorate more rapidly than we anticipate 
in the finite risk segment  we expect that the ongoing investigations by the sec and new york attorney general will reduce  but not eliminate  demand for limited risk transfer products in the short term 
although we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these investigations  we believe that once the buyers and sellers of these products perceive that the accounting  headline and regulatory risk has receded  demand will increase 
accordingly  the likelihood of writing a significant volume of new finite business is lower for than for our existing portfolio of finite risk contracts is expected to generate premium volume for that is substantially the same as for given our current mix of business by segment and expected profitability of that business we anticipate continued positive cash flow  and consequently believe that our net investment income will exceed that of risk factors numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements set forth in this form k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 
those factors include the following increased competition could adversely affect our profitability 
the property and casualty reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with reinsurers worldwide  many of which have greater financial  marketing and management resources than ours 
some of our competitors are large financial institutions that have reinsurance segments  while others are specialty reinsurance companies 
financial institutions have also created alternative capital market products that compete with reinsurance products  such as reinsurance securitization 
following the september  terrorist attack  a number of individuals and companies in the reinsurance industry established new  well capitalized  bermuda based reinsurers to benefit from improved market conditions  and a number of existing competitors raised additional capital 
many of the reinsurers that entered the reinsurance markets have or could have more capital than we have 
in addition  there may be established companies or new companies of which we are not aware that may be planning to commit capital to this market 
the full effect of this additional capital on the reinsurance market and on the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contracts of the types we expect to underwrite may not be known for some time 
competition in the types of reinsurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors  including premium charges and other terms and conditions offered  services provided  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payment  claims experience  perceived financial strength and experience and reputation of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be underwritten 
traditional as well as new capital market participants from time to time produce alternative products such as reinsurance securitizations  catastrophe bonds and various derivatives such as swaps that may compete with certain types of reinsurance  such as property catastrophe 
over time  these numerous initiatives could significantly affect supply  pricing and competition in our industry 
a downgrade in the rating assigned by best s to our operating subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to write new business 
best s has assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent to our operating subsidiaries 
this rating is the third highest of sixteen rating levels 
according to best s  a rating of a indicates best s opinion that a company has an excellent ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders 
this rating is subject to periodic review by best s and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of best s 
best s may increase its scrutiny of rated companies  revise their rating standards or take other action 
if best s revises the rating standard associated with our current rating  our rating may be downgraded or we may need to raise additional capital to maintain our rating 
best s is generally considered to be a significant rating agency with respect to the evaluation of insurance and reinsurance companies 
ratings are used by ceding companies and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
in addition  a ceding company s own rating may be adversely affected by a downgrade in the rating of its reinsurer 
therefore  a downgrade of our rating may dissuade a ceding company from reinsuring with us and may influence a ceding company to reinsure with a competitor of ours that has a higher insurance rating 
it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain terms that would allow the ceding companies to cancel the contract if we are downgraded below a certain rating level or require collateral to be posted for a portion of our obligations 
whether a client would exercise this cancellation right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  we cannot predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
we may from time to time secure our obligations under our various reinsurance contracts using trusts and letters of credit 
we have entered into agreements with several ceding companies that require us to provide collateral for our obligations under certain reinsurance contracts with these ceding companies under various circumstances  including where our obligations to these ceding companies exceed negotiated thresholds 
these thresholds may vary depending on our rating from best s or other rating agencies and a downgrade of our ratings or a failure to achieve a certain rating may increase the amount of collateral we are required to provide 
we may provide the collateral by delivering letters of credit to the ceding company  depositing assets into trust for the benefit of the ceding company or permitting the ceding company to withhold funds that would otherwise be delivered to us under the reinsurance contract 
the amount of collateral we are required to provide typically represents a portion of the obligations we may owe the ceding company  often including estimates of ibnr made by the ceding company 
since we may be required to provide collateral based on the ceding company s estimate  we may be obligated to provide collateral that exceeds our estimates of the ultimate liability to the ceding company 
we are not currently rated by any rating agencies other than best s 
we may from time to time obtain ratings from other rating agencies  though we are unable to predict the impact of any such ratings at this time 
the occurrence of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
because we underwrite property and casualty reinsurance and have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made disasters  we expect that our loss experience generally will include infrequent events of great severity 
the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable 
consequently  the occurrence of losses from a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  catastrophes are an inherent risk of our business and a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to write new business  and our financial condition and results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity and statutory surplus which is the amount remaining after all liabilities  including liabilities for losses and lae  are subtracted from all admitted assets  as determined under statutory accounting principles prescribed or permitted by us insurance regulatory authorities 
increases in the values and geographic concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation have historically resulted in increased severity of industry losses in recent years  and  although we seek to limit our overall exposure to risk by limiting the amount of reinsurance we write by geographic zone  we expect that those factors will increase the severity of catastrophe losses in the future 
if the loss limitation methods and pricing models we employ are not effective  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our property and casualty reinsurance contracts cover unpredictable events such as hurricanes  windstorms  hailstorms  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  fires  industrial explosions  freezes  riots  floods and other natural or man made disasters 
we seek to limit our overall exposure to risk by limiting the amount of reinsurance we write by geographic zone  peril and type of program or contract 
our risk management uses a variety of means  including the use of contract terms  diversification criteria  probability analysis and analysis of comparable historical loss experience 
we estimate the impact of certain catastrophic events using catastrophe modeling software and contract information to evaluate our exposure to losses from individual contracts and in the aggregate 
for example  the majority of the natural peril catastrophe reinsurance we write relates to exposures within the united states  europe and japan 
accordingly  we monitor our exposure to events that affect these regions  such as hurricanes and earthquakes in the united states  flood and wind in europe and typhoons and earthquakes in japan 
we take an active role in the evaluation of commercial catastrophe exposure models  which form the basis for our own proprietary pricing models 
these computer based loss modeling systems utilize direct exposure information obtained from our clients and independent external data to assess each client s potential for catastrophe losses 
we believe that modeling is an important part of the underwriting process for catastrophe exposure pricing 
however  these models depend on the quality of the information obtained from our clients and the external data we obtain from third parties and may prove inadequate for determining the pricing for certain catastrophe exposures 
many of our reinsurance contracts do not contain an aggregate loss limit or a loss ratio limit  which means that there is no contractual limit to the losses that we may be required to pay pursuant to such reinsurance contracts 
substantially all of our property reinsurance contracts with natural catastrophe exposure have occurrence limits that limit our exposure 
substantially all of our high layer property  casualty and marine excess of loss contracts also contain aggregate loss limits  with limited reinstatements of an occurrence limit  which restore the original limit under the contract after the limit has been depleted by losses incurred on that treaty 
various provisions of our contracts  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  may not be enforceable in the manner we intend  due to  among other things  disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum 
underwriting is a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity and statutory surplus 
if we are required to increase our liabilities for losses and lae  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and us gaap to establish liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for payment of losses and lae that will arise from our reinsurance products 
at any time  these liabilities may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and lae 
to the extent these liabilities may be insufficient to cover actual losses or lae  we will have to add to these liabilities and incur a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the liabilities established on our consolidated balance sheet do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but rather are estimates of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement of losses 
all of our liability estimates are based on actuarial and statistical projections at a given time  facts and circumstances known at that time and estimates of trends in loss severity and other variable factors  including new concepts of liability and general economic conditions 
changes in these trends or other variable factors could result in claims in excess of the liabilities that we have established 
unforeseen losses  the type or magnitude of which we cannot predict  may emerge in the future 
these additional losses could arise from changes in the legal environment  catastrophic events  extraordinary events affecting our clients such as reorganizations and liquidations or changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  because we  like other reinsurers  do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that our ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded to us may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
under us gaap  platinum us  platinum uk and platinum bermuda are not permitted to establish liabilities until an event occurs which may give rise to a loss 
once such an event occurs  liabilities are established based upon estimates of the total losses incurred by the ceding companies and an estimate of the portion of such loss our three operating subsidiaries have reinsured 
as a result  only liabilities applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be established  with no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account for unexpected future losses 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the loss is incurred 
such future losses could be substantial 
retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms 
in order to limit the effect on our financial condition of large and multiple losses  we may buy retrocessional reinsurance  which is reinsurance for our own account 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
if we are unable or unwilling to obtain retrocessional reinsurance  our financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by catastrophic losses 
elimination of all or portions of our retrocessional coverage could subject us to increased  and possibly material  exposure or could cause us to underwrite less business 
a retrocessionaire s insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance treaty with us could have a material adverse effect on us 
therefore  our retrocessions subject us to credit risk because the ceding of risk to retrocessionaires does not relieve a reinsurer of its liability to the ceding companies 
we are dependent on the business provided to us by reinsurance brokers and we may be exposed to liability for brokers failure to make payments to clients for their claims 
we market most of our reinsurance products through reinsurance brokers 
the reinsurance brokerage industry generally  and our sources of business specifically  are concentrated 
the loss of business relationships with any of our top five brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  some of these brokers have invested in new bermuda reinsurance companies that may compete with us 
in accordance with industry practice  we expect to frequently pay amounts owing in respect of claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  for payment over to the ceding companies 
in the event that a broker fails to make such a payment  depending on the jurisdiction  we may remain liable to the ceding company for the deficiency 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when premiums for such policies are paid to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  such premiums will be deemed to have been paid and the ceding company will no longer be liable to us for those amounts whether or not actually received by us 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with our brokers during the payment process 
in october  the office of the attorney general of the state of new york announced that it had commenced a civil suit against marsh mclennan companies marsh  alleging that certain of its business practices were fraudulent and violated antitrust and securities laws 
this action resulted from an industry wide investigation relating to the conduct of insurance and reinsurance brokers  which is ongoing 
regulatory authorities in several other states have opened similar investigations 
in january  marsh agreed to pay million to settle these charges 
the company was not a party to this litigation and did not receive any subpoena or information requests with respect to this litigation 
we underwrite substantially all of our reinsurance through brokers  including a substantial portion through marsh 
we are unable to predict the impact  if any  that these investigations  and any increased regulatory oversight that might result therefrom  may have on our business 
the current investigations into certain non traditional  or loss mitigation  insurance products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november and december  we received subpoenas from the sec and the office of the attorney general for the state of new york for documents and information relating to certain non traditional  or loss mitigation  insurance products 
we are fully cooperating in responding to all such requests 
other reinsurance companies have reported receiving similar subpoenas and requests 
this investigation appears to be at a very preliminary stage and  accordingly  we are unable to predict the direction the investigation will take and the impact  if any  it may have on our business 
the property and casualty reinsurance business is historically cyclical  and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable pricing 
historically  property and casualty reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary insurers and prevailing general economic and market conditions  all of which affect ceding companies decisions as to the amount or portion of risk that they retain for their own accounts and consequently reinsurance premium rates 
the supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices  the levels of insured losses and levels of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry 
as a result  the property and casualty reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry  characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable pricing 
we can expect to experience the effects of such cyclicality 
the cyclical trends in the industry and the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including what management believes to be a trend of courts to grant increasingly larger awards for certain damages  natural disasters such as catastrophic hurricanes  windstorms  tornadoes  earthquakes and floods  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of and income and returns on investments and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by primary insurers 
we cannot predict whether market conditions will improve  remain constant or deteriorate 
a return to unfavorable market conditions may affect our ability to write reinsurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed 
if we cannot write property and casualty reinsurance at appropriate rates  our ability to transact reinsurance business would be significantly and adversely affected 
our invested assets are subject to market volatility and interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuation 
the company s principal invested assets are fixed maturities  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in interest rates 
depending on our classification of our investments as available for sale  trading or other assets  changes in the market value of our securities are reflected in either our consolidated balance sheet or statement of income 
the company s investment portfolio is also subject to credit risk resulting from adverse changes in the issuer s ability to repay the debt 
these risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the company s principal exposure to foreign currency risk is its obligation to settle claims in foreign currencies 
the possibility exists that the company may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses as it ultimately settles claims required to be paid in foreign currencies 
to the extent the company does not seek to hedge its foreign currency risk or hedges prove ineffective  the resulting impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rate could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
platinum holdings is a holding company and  consequently  its cash flow is dependent on dividends  interest and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries 
platinum holdings is a holding company that conducts no reinsurance operations of its own 
all operations are conducted by its wholly owned operating subsidiaries  platinum us  platinum uk and platinum bermuda 
as a holding company  platinum holdings cash flow consists primarily of dividends  interest and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries 
platinum holdings depends on such payments for general corporate purposes and to meet its obligations  including the payment of any dividends to its shareholders 
additionally  under the bermuda companies act  platinum holdings may declare or pay a dividend only if  among other things  it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or after the payment would be  able to pay its liabilities as they become due 
for a discussion of the legal limitations on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to platinum holdings  see business regulation 
the imposition of us corporate income tax on platinum holdings and its non us subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that platinum holdings  platinum uk  platinum bermuda and platinum ireland each operate in such a manner that none of these companies is subject to us corporate income tax because they are not engaged in a trade or business in the us nevertheless  because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the us is not provided by the tax authorities  the us internal revenue service might contend that any of these companies is engaged in a trade or business in the us  which would subject such company to us tax at regular corporate rates on the income that is effectively connected with the us trade or business  plus an additional branch profits tax on such income remaining after the regular tax in certain circumstances 
any such tax could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could significantly and adversely affect our business 
the business of reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers 
in bermuda  we operate under relatively less intensive regulatory requirements 
however  in the united states and in the united kingdom licensed reinsurers are highly regulated and must comply with financial supervision standards comparable to those governing primary insurers 
for a detailed discussion of the regulatory requirements to which platinum holdings and its subsidiaries are subject  see business regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could materially adversely affect our financial results and operations 
in addition  these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to write new business or  as indicated above  distribute funds to platinum holdings 
in recent years  some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
moreover  the naic and state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws that may be more restrictive or may result in higher costs to us than current statutory requirements 
platinum bermuda is not registered or licensed as an insurance company in any jurisdiction outside bermuda 
platinum bermuda conducts its business solely through its offices in bermuda and does not maintain an office  and its personnel do not conduct any insurance activities  in the us or elsewhere 
although platinum bermuda does not believe it is in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction outside bermuda  inquiries or challenges to platinum bermuda s insurance activities may still be raised in the future 
the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including u 
s 
federal and various state jurisdictions 
in the past  there have been congressional and other proposals in the united states regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry  including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the united states 
if platinum bermuda were to become subject to any insurance laws and regulations of the united states or any us state  which are generally more restrictive than those applicable to it in bermuda  platinum bermuda might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing specified types of policies or contracts 
complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to conduct its business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market and credit risk the company s principal invested assets are fixed maturities  which are subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices and credit risk resulting from adverse changes in the borrower s ability to meet its debt service obligations 
the company s strategy to limit this risk is to place its investments in high quality credit issues and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer or industry 
the company also selects investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of related estimated claim liabilities 
the company attempts to minimize the credit risk by actively monitoring the portfolio and requiring a minimum average credit rating for its portfolio of a as defined by moody s investor service 
as of december   the portfolio has a dollar weighted average rating of aa the company has other receivable amounts subject to credit risk 
the most significant of these are reinsurance premiums receivable from ceding companies 
to mitigate credit risk related to premium receivables  we have established standards for ceding companies and  in most cases  have a contractual right of offset thereby allowing the company to settle claims net of any premium receivable 
while credit risk related to amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires is not material as of december   we consider the financial strength of retrocessionaires when determining whether to purchase coverage from them 
retrocessional coverage is generally obtained from companies rated a or better by best s unless the retrocessionaire s obligations are fully collateralized 
for exposures where losses become known and are paid in a relatively short period of time  we may obtain retrocessional coverage from companies rated a or better by best s 
the financial performance and rating status of all material retrocessionaires is routinely monitored 
in accordance with industry practice  the company frequently pays amounts in respect of claims under contracts to reinsurance brokers  for payment over to the ceding companies 
in the event that a broker fails to make such a payment  depending on the jurisdiction  the company may remain liable to the ceding company for the payment 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when premiums for such contracts are paid to reinsurance brokers for payment over to the company  such premiums will be deemed to have been paid and the ceding company will no longer be liable to the company for those amounts whether or not actually received by the company 
consequently  the company assumes a degree of credit risk associated with its brokers during the payment process 
to mitigate credit risk related to reinsurance brokers  the company has established guidelines for brokers and intermediaries 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
movements in rates can result in changes in the market value of our fixed income portfolio and can cause changes in the actual timing of receipt of certain principal payments 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of our fixed income portfolio and can expose our portfolio  in particular our mortgage backed securities  to extension risk 
conversely  a decline in interest rates will result in a rise in the market value of our fixed income portfolio and can expose our portfolio  in particular our mortgage backed securities  to prepayment risk 
the aggregate hypothetical impact on our fixed income portfolio  generated from an immediate parallel shift in the treasury yield curve  as of december  is approximately as follows in thousands interest rate shift in basis points bp bp current bp bp total market value      percent change in market value resulting unrealized appreciation depreciation      foreign currency risk the company writes business on a worldwide basis 
consequently  the company s principal exposure to foreign currency risk is its transaction of business in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact revenues  costs  receivables and liabilities  as measured in the us dollar  our financial reporting currency 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure to its largest foreign currency risks by holding invested assets denominated in foreign currencies to offset liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
sources of fair value the following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments as of december  in thousands carrying fair amount value financial assets fixed maturities available for sale   fixed maturity trading securities 
  total fixed maturities   other invested asset   financial liabilities debt obligations   the fair value of fixed maturities is based on quoted closing market prices at the reporting date for those or similar investments 
the fair values of debt obligations are based on quoted market prices 
other invested asset represents a strategic investment in a non public reinsurance company and is carried at estimated fair value
