item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional qualitative and quantitative information regarding the company s allowance for credit losses including information regarding management estimates as to the sufficiency of the allowance for credit losses 
seasonality while the company as a whole is not materially influenced by seasonal trends  the residential mortgage banking industry  generally  and the company s financial intermediary segment are subject to seasonal trends 
these trends reflect the general pattern of resale of homes  which typically peaks during the spring and summer seasons and declines to lower levels from mid november through january 
refinancings tend to be less seasonal and more closely related to changes in interest rates 
competition retail banking the marketplace for general banking services is highly competitive and commoditized 
the company previously enjoyed a unique market position as one of the few online banking providers and had no head to head competitors 
it also had the potential for a significant pricing advantage since it operated a branchless business model and did not have the fixed overhead expenses of its branch based competitors 
as a result  the company was able to compete aggressively on convenience and price 
these advantages have diminished recently 
over the past several years  traditional branch banks began to offer online services 
initially  these banks charged a fee for their service since it represented an additional  incremental cost to the bank 
within the last months  these banks have generally dropped these fees 
many of these banks now recognize that online banking customers tend to be more profitable than offline customers 
industry research has shown that online customers generally maintain higher balances  require less customer support and have lower attrition rates than their offline counterparts 
today  the company competes directly with large national banks  such as bank of america  citigroup and wells fargo  along with community banks  credit unions and non traditional banking providers  such as e trade  charles schwab and others 
as these institutions have closed the gap on the convenience front  the company has found that it is competing more frequently on price alone 
the company does not consider price leadership a viable or prudent marketing strategy over the long term 
higher deposit rates may not be compelling enough to convince the average consumer to choose a branchless bank over a traditional bank that can provide branches and an online offering 
management believes the company has an opportunity to regain competitive advantage in the future by focusing on bundled product offerings  ease of use and highly integrated technology  but there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful 
financial intermediary the mortgage banking industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with financial institutions  mainly mortgage banking companies  commercial banks and savings and loan associations and  to a lesser extent  credit unions and insurance companies 
the company competes principally by purchasing or originating a variety of mortgage loans  emphasizing the quality of its service and pricing the loans at competitive rates 
many of the company s competitors may have greater financial resources  better operating efficiencies and longer operating histories than the company 
many of the nation s largest mortgage banking companies and commercial banks have a significant number of branch offices in areas in which the company s correspondents and wholesale regional operations centers operate 
increased competition for mortgage loans from larger lenders may result in a decrease in the volume of loans purchased or originated by the company  thereby likely reducing the company s revenues 
at the same time  fannie mae and freddie mac are developing technologies and business practices that could reduce their reliance on large mortgage banking companies for loan production and enable them to directly access smaller producers for volume 
due to the current highly competitive market pricing environment  the company may be unable to achieve its planned level of originations or consummate acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights at a satisfactory cost 
the company does not have a significant market share of mortgage banking activities in the areas in which it conducts operations 
due to the foregoing considerations  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the markets it serves 
inability to compete successfully would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
transaction processing the transaction processing marketplace is highly competitive and fairly fractured  with a few large and well known providers dominating in different areas of specialty 
the company is competing in a number of emerging markets  such as electronic deposit and payment clearing 
however  larger providers are also targeting these markets for growth 
the company believes it can compete effectively by catering to smaller companies who are unlikely to attract the interest of these larger providers 
the company does operate in one marketplace that is generally more mature 
the atm processing industry is fairly saturated 
in  there was significant consolidation among providers 
the company s atm operation participated in the consolidation by acquiring the servicing contracts for a number of smaller  independent atm networks 
these additions led to greater scale and efficiency improvements  and the company believes the operation is well positioned for continued growth 
at year end  the operation had  atms and  merchant processing terminals in deployment 
intellectual property and proprietary rights netbank regards the form and substance of its name and other intellectual property that it has developed as proprietary  and netbank attempts to protect them by seeking court enforcement of its intellectual property rights 
netbank takes active measures to safeguard its name and other proprietary intellectual property 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary information is difficult  however  because of the uncertain and complicated nature of this kind of litigation

netbank owns the internet domain name netbank 
com 
as well as other domain names related to the businesses the company operates

netbank actively monitors the use of potentially infringing names on the internet and takes action to protect its intellectual property rights 
supervision and regulation savings and loan holding companies and federal savings banks are extensively regulated under federal law  as are operating subsidiaries of federal savings banks 
the following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or may affect the company and its major subsidiaries with regard to savings and loan holding company regulation  bank regulation and mortgage banking regulation 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute and regulatory provision referred to below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the businesses of the company and its subsidiaries 
certain of the company s subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations 
supervision  regulation and examination of the company and its subsidiaries by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and borrowers rather than shareholders and creditors of the company 
the terms savings association  federal savings bank and thrift are used interchangeably in this section 
savings and loan holding company regulation the company is a registered holding company under both the savings and loan holding company act the slhca set forth in section of the home owners loan act hola and the financial institutions code of georgia ficg 
the company is regulated under such acts by the office of thrift supervision the ots and by the georgia department of banking and finance the georgia department  respectively 
as a savings and loan holding company  the company is required to file with the ots an annual report and such additional information as the ots may require pursuant to the slhca 
the ots also conducts annual safety and soundness and information technology examinations of the company 
savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in any activity or rendering any services for or on behalf of their savings institution subsidiaries for the purpose or with the effect of evading any law or regulation applicable to the institution 
this restriction is designed to prevent the use of holding company affiliates to evade requirements of the slhca that are designed to protect the holding company s savings institution subsidiaries 
however  if the holding company owns only one insured institution a unitary holding company and was in existence prior to may   the slhca and the ficg impose no such restrictions on the activities of its non bank subsidiaries  provided that the lone savings institution satisfies the qualified thrift lender test discussed below 
moreover  a unitary holding company that satisfies these requirements is not restricted to any statutory prescribed list of permissible activities 
however  the financial services modernization act of the fsm act provides that  while existing unitary holding companies retain these unrestricted powers  if the unitary holding company is then acquired by another party  its powers are restricted to those permitted for financial holding companies under the act 
the company is currently a unitary holding company that satisfies these requirements 
the slhca and the ficg makes it unlawful for any savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries or one or more transactions  to acquire control of another savings association or another savings and loan holding company without prior approval from the ots and the georgia department  respectively 
the acquisition of more than of any class of voting stock of a savings association or holding company is deemed to be conclusive evidence of control 
savings and loan holding companies are allowed to acquire or to retain as much as of the voting shares of an unaffiliated savings institution or savings and loan holding company without regulatory approval 
on december   congress passed the american homeownership and economic opportunity act of  which permits savings and loan holding companies to acquire or to retain a to non controlling interest in an unaffiliated savings institution or savings and loan holding company with prior regulatory approval 
an acquisition by merger  consolidation or purchase of assets of such an institution or holding company or of substantially all of the assets of such an institution or holding company is also prohibited without prior ots or georgia department approval 
when considering an application for such an acquisition  the ots and the georgia department take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the prospective acquiring company and the institution involved 
this includes consideration of the competence  experience and integrity of the officers  directors and principal shareholders of the acquiring company and savings institution 
in addition  the ots and the georgia department consider the effect of the acquisition on the institution  the insurance risk to the savings association insurance fund saif  the convenience and needs of the community to be served and any possible anti competitive effect 
the ots may not approve an acquisition that would result in the formation of certain types of interstate holding company networks 
the ots is precluded from approving an acquisition that would result in the formation of a multiple holding company controlling institutions in more than one state unless the acquiring company or one of its savings institution subsidiaries is authorized to acquire control of an institution or to operate an office in the additional state pursuant to a supervisory acquisition authorized under section k of the federal deposit insurance act or unless the statutes of the state in which the institution to be acquired is located permits such an acquisition 
in connection with the march  acquisition of resource by the company  the regional director of the ots and the company entered into a side letter agreement providing that the company  on a consolidated basis  maintain a minimum common equity capital to total assets ratio of through december  subsequently  the ots approved excluding from this calculation capital held against forward sold conforming mortgages  for which required capital would be the greater of or  provided that the total capital to total assets would not fall below 
additionally  netbank  fsb was required to maintain a minimum of core capital and total risk based capital ratios through december  while netbank  fsb was not in compliance with the terms of the side letter agreement on december   it expired on january  and therefore  the company and netbank  fsb are no longer subject to its restrictive terms 
the company is not aware of any negative consequences associated with the expired side letter agreement 
netbank  fsb was categorized as well capitalized with a total risk based capital ratio of as of december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding netbank s capital 
the georgia department requires that savings and loan holding companies  such as the company  maintain a tier leverage ratio on a consolidated basis 
bank regulation general 
the bank is a federal savings bank organized under the laws of the united states 
the bank and its operating subsidiaries are subject to annual examination by the ots for safety and soundness  for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations and for information technology 
the ots regulates all areas of the bank s operations including reserves  loans  mergers  payment of dividends  interest rates  establishment of branches  and other aspects of operations 
ots regulations generally provide that federal savings banks and their operating subsidiaries must be examined no less frequently than every months  with certain exceptions 
the bank is subject to assessments by the ots to cover the costs of such examinations 
the bank is also insured and regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the major functions of the fdic with respect to insured federal savings banks include paying depositors to the extent provided by law in the event an insured bank is closed without adequately providing for payment of the claims of depositors 
the fdic also works to prevent the development and continuance of unsound and unsafe banking practices 
subsidiary institutions of a savings and loan holding company  such as the bank  are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on any extension of credit to the holding company or any of its subsidiaries  on investment in the stock or other securities thereof  and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower 
see the section entitled transactions with affiliates restriction below for greater detail 
in addition  a holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of any property or services 
capital requirements 
ots regulations require that federal savings banks maintain i tangible capital in an amount of not less than of total assets  ii core capital in an amount not less than of total assets  and iii a level of risk based capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
under ots regulations  the term core capital generally includes common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less unidentifiable intangible assets other than certain amounts of supervisory goodwill and certain investments in certain subsidiaries plus of the fair market value of readily marketable purchased mortgage servicing rights pmsrs and purchased credit card relationships subject to certain conditions 
tangible capital generally is defined as core capital minus intangible assets and investments in certain subsidiaries  except pmsrs 
in determining total risk weighted assets for purposes of the risk based requirement  i each off balance sheet asset must be converted to its on balance sheet credit equivalent amount by multiplying the face amount of each such item by a credit conversion factor ranging from to depending upon the nature of the asset  ii the credit equivalent amount of each off balance sheet asset and each on balance sheet asset must be multiplied by a risk factor ranging from to depending upon the nature of the asset and iii the resulting amounts are added together and constitute total risk weighted assets 
total capital  for purposes of the risk based capital requirement equals the sum of core capital plus supplementary capital which  as defined  includes the sum of  among other items  perpetual preferred stock not counted as core capital  limited life preferred stock  subordinated debt  and general loan and lease loss allowances up to of risk weighted assets less certain deductions 
the amount of supplementary capital that may be counted towards satisfaction of the total capital requirement may not exceed of core capital  and ots regulations require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of core capital to total risk weighted assets of 
ots regulations also include an interest rate risk component in the risk based capital requirement 
under this regulation  an institution is considered to have excess interest rate risk if  based upon a basis point change in market interest rates  the market value of an institution s capital changes by more than 
this requirement does not have any material effect on the ability of the bank to meet the risk based capital requirement 
the ots also revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that its standards provide adequately for concentration of credit risk  risk from nontraditional activities and actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi family mortgages 
capital requirements higher than the generally applicable minimum requirement may be established for a particular savings association if the ots determines that the institution s capital was or may become inadequate in view of its particular circumstances 
prompt corrective action 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions 
under this system  the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized in which all institutions are placed 
federal banking regulators are required to take some mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions  with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories 
the severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed 
generally  subject to a narrow exception  the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category 
an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency 
a holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan  subject to certain limitations 
the controlling holding company s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of of an undercapitalized subsidiary s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements 
an undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets  making acquisitions  establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business  except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with regulatory approval 
an institution may be downgraded to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital 
fdic insurance assessments 
the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities 
the system assigns an institution to one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized 
these three categories are substantially similar to the prompt corrective action categories described above  with the undercapitalized category including institutions that are undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized for prompt corrective action purposes 
the fdic also assigns an institution to one of three supervisory subgroups within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation that the institution s primary federal regulator provides to the fdic and information that the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds 
the fdic then determines an institution s insurance assessment rate based on the institution s capital category and supervisory category 
under the risk based assessment system  there are nine combinations of capital groups and supervisory subgroups to which different assessment rates are applied 
assessments range from to cents per of deposits  depending on the institution s capital group and supervisory subgroup 
in addition  effective january   the fdic imposed assessments to help pay off the million in annual interest payments on the billion financing corporation bonds issued in the late s as part of the government rescue of the thrift industry 
the assessment is adjusted quarterly and is set at cents per of deposits the same assessment rate that is imposed on commercial banks for the first quarter of the fdic may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order  or condition imposed by the fdic 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act cra requires that  in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions  the federal banking regulators shall evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
these facts are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions  and applications to open a branch or facility 
failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on the bank 
the cra requires that the board of directors of financial institutions  such as the bank  adopt a cra statement for each assessment area that  among other things  describes its efforts to help meet community credit needs and the specific types of credit that the institution is willing to extend 
the bank s cra performance will be assessed pursuant to the following criteria the bank s loan to deposit ratio  adjusted for seasonal variation and  as appropriate  other related lending activities such as loan originations for sale to the secondary markets  community development loans and qualified investments  the percentage of loans and  as appropriate  other lending related activities located in the bank s assessment area  the bank s record of lending to and  as appropriate  engaging in other lending related activities for borrowers of different income levels and businesses and farms of different sizes  the geographic distribution of the bank s loans  and the bank s record of taking action if warranted in response to written complaints about its performance in helping to meet credit needs in its assessment area 
additionally  the terms of any cra related agreements must be publicly disclosed 
capital distributions 
an ots rule requires prior notice of all capital distributions by savings associations that are subsidiaries of a holding company including dividends  stock repurchases and cash out mergers 
an institution that both before and after a proposed capital distribution has net capital equal to or in excess of its capital requirements may  subject to any otherwise applicable statutory or regulatory requirements or agreements entered into with the regulators  without an application to the ots make capital distributions in any calendar year up to of its net income to date during the calendar year to date plus the retained net income for the two preceding calendar years 
an institution that either before or after a proposed capital distribution fails to meet its then applicable minimum capital requirement or that has been notified that it needs more than normal supervision may not make any capital distributions without the prior written approval of the ots 
in addition  the ots may prohibit a proposed capital distribution  which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation  if the ots determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
equity investments 
the ots has revised its risk based capital regulation to modify the treatment of certain equity investments and to clarify the treatment of other equity investments 
equity investments that are permissible for both savings banks and national banks will no longer be deducted from savings associations calculations of total capital over a five year period 
instead  permissible equity investments will be placed in the risk weight category  mirroring the capital treatment prescribed for those investments when made by national banks under the regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency 
equity investments held by savings associations that are not permissible for national banks must still be deducted from assets and total capital 
qualified thrift lender requirement 
a federal savings bank is deemed to be a qualified thrift lender qtl as long as its qualified thrift investments equal or exceed of its portfolio assets on a monthly average basis in nine out of every months 
qualified thrift investments generally consist of i various housing related loans and investments such as residential construction and mortgage loans  home improvement loans  mobile home loans  home equity loans and mortgage backed securities  ii certain obligations of the fdic and iii shares of stock issued by any federal home loan bank fhlb  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
in addition  the following assets may be categorized as qualified thrift investments in an amount not to exceed in the aggregate of portfolio assets i of the dollar amount of residential mortgage loans originated and sold within days of origination  ii investments in securities of a service corporation that derives at least of its income from residential housing finance  iii of loans and investments made to acquire  develop or construct starter homes or homes in credit needy areas subject to certain conditions  iv loans for the purchase or construction of churches  schools  nursing homes and hospitals  and v consumer loans in an amount up to of portfolio assets 
for purposes of the qtl test  the term portfolio assets means the savings institution s total assets minus goodwill and other intangible assets  the value of property used by the savings institution to conduct its business  and liquid assets held by the savings institution in an amount up to of its total assets 
ots regulations provide that any savings association that fails to meet the definition of a qtl must either convert to a national bank charter or limit its future investments and activities including branching and payments of dividends to those permitted for both savings associations and national banks 
further  within one year of the loss of qtl status  a holding company of a savings association that does not convert to a bank charter must register as a bank holding company and will be subject to all statutes applicable to bank holding companies 
in order for the bank to exercise the powers granted to federally chartered savings associations and for the company to retain the power of a unitary holding company  the bank must meet the definition of a qtl 
as of december  netbank  fsb was deemed to be a qtl 
loans to one borrower limitations 
hola generally requires savings associations to comply with the loans to one borrower limitations applicable to national banks 
national banks generally may make loans to a single borrower in amounts up to of their unimpaired capital and surplus  plus an additional of capital and surplus for loans secured by readily marketable collateral 
hola provides exceptions under which a savings association may make loans to one borrower in excess of the generally applicable national bank limits 
a savings association may make loans to one borrower in excess of such limits under one of the following circumstances i for any purpose  in any amount not to exceed  or ii to develop domestic residential housing units  in an amount not to exceed the lesser of million or of the savings association s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  provided other conditions are satisfied 
the federal institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of provided that a savings association could make loans to one borrower to finance the sale of real property acquired in satisfaction of debts previously contracted in good faith in amounts up to of the savings association s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
the ots  however  has modified this standard by limiting loans to one borrower to finance the sale of real property acquired in satisfaction of debts to of unimpaired capital and surplus 
that rule provides  however  that purchase money mortgages received by a savings association to finance the sale of such real property do not constitute loans provided no new funds are advanced and the savings association is not placed in a more detrimental position holding the note than holding the real estate and  therefore  are not subject to the loans to one borrower limitations 
commercial real property loans 
hola limits the aggregate amount of commercial real estate loans that a federal savings association may make to an amount not in excess of of the savings association s capital 
federal home loan bank system 
the fhlb system consists of regional fhlbs  each subject to supervision and regulation by the federal housing finance board the fhfb 
the fhlbs provide a central credit facility for member savings associations 
the maximum amount that the fhlb of atlanta will advance fluctuates from time to time in accordance with changes in policies of the fhfb and the fhlb of atlanta  and the maximum amount generally is reduced by borrowings from any other source 
the financial services modernization act has enabled the fhlb to expand the credit window for members by expanding the purposes for which fhlb s may make secured advances and the types of collateral eligible to secure these advances  as well as eliminating restrictions on advances to thrifts not meeting the qtl test 
federal reserve system 
the federal reserve board has adopted regulations that require savings associations to maintain non earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of cash or a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the bank s interest earning assets 
savings institutions also have the authority to borrow from the federal reserve discount window 
federal reserve board regulations  however  require savings associations to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from a federal reserve bank 
privacy 
financial institutions are regulated by federal law and federal regulatory agency rules that are designed to protect the privacy rights of its customers who obtain goods or services from the institution that are to be used primarily for personal  family or household purposes 
state legislatures and agencies are increasingly active in the same regard 
in general  this body of law requires the institutions to disclose their policies for collecting  sharing and protecting the confidential information of their customers 
under the gramm leach bliley act of the glba  for example  customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances  such as in the course of processing a transaction requested by the customer  in connection with the institution s joint sponsorship of a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party  or when required to do so under various state or federal laws ie  complying with a subpoena 
additionally  the glba provides that financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers 
customer s rights to privacy are also protected by the fair credit reporting act  addressed below in consumer credit reporting 
regulatory agencies  including the ots and the fdic  jointly published a privacy rule that establishes information security safeguards  including a requirement for annual risk assessments and other administrative  technical and physical safeguards 
such safeguards are to insure the security of the customers records in light of potential threats  hazards or unauthorized access to or use of such records that could harm the customer 
consumer credit reporting 
on december   and in part due to the growing threat of identity theft in our society  president george w 
bush signed the fair and accurate credit transactions act the fact act  amending the federal fair credit reporting act the fcra 
most of the amendments to the fcra the fcra amendments were to have become effective in late  depending on implementing regulations to be issued by the federal trade commission and the federal bank regulatory agencies

the fcra amendments also prohibit a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate from using that information for marketing purposes unless the consumer is first provided a notice and an opportunity to direct the business not to use the information for such marketing purposes the opt out  subject to certain exceptions 
while the fcra amendments will limit netbank s ability to share information with its affiliates for marketing purposes  the actual impact of these limitations will depend on the extent to which our customers elect to prohibit the use of their personal information for marketing purposes 
we have no basis at this time to predict the volume of consumer opt outs 
netbank and its subsidiaries have implemented policies and procedures for those provisions with a mandatory compliance date on or before december  prior to the effective date of the remaining fcra amendments  netbank and its subsidiaries will implement policies and procedures to comply with the new rules 
anti money laundering and anti terrorism legislation

can spam act of can spam went into effect on january  preempting most state laws governing the same 
it requires senders of commercial electronic messages whose primary purpose is promotion of a commercial product or service  to clearly and conspicuously identify the message as an advertisement or solicitation  include an clear and conspicuous notice to the recipient that they can opt out of receiving future commercial e mail messages from the sender  and provide an electronic way for them to exercise that option 
it also prohibits certain practices like falsifying header information or using deceptive subject lines 
mortgage banking regulation the mortgage banking operations of the company are subject to extensive regulation by federal governmental authorities 
the company s mortgage operations are also subject to various laws  including those discussed above under the heading consumer protection laws and regulations loan operations and judicial and administrative decisions that  among other things  regulate credit granting activities  require disclosures to customers  govern secured transactions and establish collection  repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices 
the company s mortgage operations are also subject to the rules and regulations of the fha  freddie mac  fannie mae  ginnie mae  hud and the va with respect to originating  processing  underwriting  selling  securitizing and servicing mortgage loans 
in addition  there are other federal and state statutes and regulations  as well as judicial decisions  affecting such activities 
those rules and regulations  among other things  impose licensing obligations on the company  establish eligibility criteria for mortgage loans  prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines that include provisions for inspections and appraisals  require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts  and with respect to va loans  fix maximum interest rates 
moreover  lenders such as the company are required to submit annually to the fha  freddie mac  fannie mae  ginnie mae and the va audited financial statements  and each regulatory entity has its own financial requirements 
the company s mortgage operations also are subject to examination by the fha  freddie mac  fannie mae  ginnie mae and the va at all times to assure compliance with applicable regulations  policies and procedures 
many of the aforementioned requirements are designed to protect the interests of consumers  while others protect the owners or insurers of mortgage loans 
failure to comply with these requirements can lead to loss of approved status  termination of servicing contracts without compensation to the servicer  demands for indemnification or loan repurchases  class action lawsuits and administrative enforcement actions 
such regulatory requirements are subject to change from time to time and may in the future become more restrictive  thereby making compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise restricting the ability of the company to conduct its business as such business is now conducted 
there are various state and local laws and regulations affecting the company s mortgage operations 
the company s mortgage businesses are in possession of licenses in all states in which they do business if such licenses are required and the requirement for such license is not preempted by federal law 
some of the company s mortgage loans also may be subject to state usury statutes 
effect of governmental monetary polices the company s earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the federal reserve bank s monetary policies have had  and are likely to continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of financial institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy in order  among other things  to curb inflation or combat a recession 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have major effects upon the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
likewise  the monetary policies of the federal reserve can dramatically impact the level of overall mortgage industry volumes and the volumes of mortgages produced and servicing prepayments experienced by the company s mortgage banking operations 
it is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
transactions with affiliates restrictions the bank and its subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of section a of the federal reserve act 
section a places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit to affiliates  the amount of investment in affiliates  the amount of the purchase of assets from affiliates  except for real and personal property exempted by the federal reserve  the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates  and the amount of any guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate 
for purposes of section a  an affiliate generally includes a bank s parent and all other affiliates  except the bank and its subsidiaries 
the aggregate of all of the above transactions is limited in amount  as to any one affiliate  to of a savings bank s capital and surplus and  as to all affiliates combined  to of a bank s capital and surplus 
in addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions  each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements 
the bank and its subsidiaries must also comply with certain provisions designed to avoid the taking of low quality assets from affiliates 
the bank and its subsidiaries are also subject to the provisions of section b of the federal reserve act which  among other things  prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates  including the above types  unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
the bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers  directors  certain principal shareholders and their related interests 
generally  these extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
proposed legislation and regulatory action new regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide ranging proposals for altering the structures  regulations and competitive relationships of the nation s financial institutions 
the company cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which its business may be affected by any new regulation or statute 
legislation that would eliminate the federal savings bank charter is under discussion from time to time 
if such legislation is enacted  the bank would be required to convert its federal savings bank charter to either a national bank charter or to a state depository institution charter 
various legislative proposals in recent years would have resulted in the restructuring of federal regulatory oversight  including  for example  consolidation of the ots into another agency  or creation of a new federal banking agency to replace the various agencies which presently exist 
the company is unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or  if enacted  whether it will contain relief as to bad debt deductions previously taken 
in addition  certain recent and proposed state and local legislation and regulations designed to protect consumers from predatory lending practices of unscrupulous lenders has had and may continue to have the unintended consequence of imposing unrealistic barriers on legitimate lenders ability to make mortgage loans and of restricting a consumer s access to mortgage credit 
insurance regulation netinsurance and mg reinsurance are subject to insurance laws and regulations governing their activities in the jurisdictions where they operate 
risks relating to netbank s business changes in economic conditions netbank s business is subject to various business risks  including competition from other financial institutions and other mortgage banking companies 
economic conditions affect the consumer s decision to buy or sell residences as well as the number of residential mortgage loan delinquencies and foreclosures  the value of collateral supporting loan portfolios  administrative costs in evaluating and processing mortgage loan applications  and the cost and availability of funds that lending companies rely upon to make or purchase loans 
changes in the level of consumer confidence  tax laws  real estate values  prevailing interest rates and investment returns expected by the financial community could make mortgage loans of the types originated or purchased by the company less attractive to borrowers or investors 
competition also may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates and general and local economic conditions 
the company continues to face the same challenges as other companies within the banking and mortgage banking industries and  therefore  is not immune to significant volume declines  primarily in its mortgage banking operations  precipitated by changes in interest rates or other factors beyond its control 
interest rate risks netbank s principal businesses are retail banking and the origination and purchase of mortgage loans 
these businesses are funded by customer deposits and  to the extent necessary  other borrowed funds 
consequently  a significant portion of netbank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and fluctuations in interest rates will affect netbank s future net interest income and cash flows 
changes in long term interest rates that do not correlate to changes in short term interest rates can cause disproportionate changes in the value of netbank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities or the shrinkage or widening of the spread netbank expects to earn by holding interest earning assets 
a decrease in the spread would have a negative impact on netbank s earnings and cash flow 
litigation in mortgage banking in recent years  the mortgage banking industry has been subject to class action lawsuits that allege violations of federal and state laws and regulations  including the propriety of collecting and paying various fees and charges and the calculation of escrow amounts 
class action lawsuits have been commenced against various mortgage banking companies  including the company  alleging  inter alia  that the payment of certain fees to mortgage brokers violates the anti kickback provisions of respa 
recent interpretations by hud together with several subsequent appellate court decisions have indicated that class actions regarding a lender s compensation to brokers are inappropriate for resolution of the issue 
so far  all of the cases have been resolved favorably for the mortgage banking industry  but if any of these cases are resolved against the lenders  it may cause an industry wide change in the way independent mortgage brokers are compensated 
such a change could have a material adverse effect on the company and the entire mortgage lending industry 
the company s broker compensation and table funded correspondent purchase programs permit such payments 
although the company believes these programs comply with all applicable laws and are consistent with long standing industry practice and regulatory interpretations  in the future new regulatory interpretations or judicial decisions may require the company to change its broker compensation and table funded correspondent purchase practices 
class action lawsuits may continue to be filed in the future against the mortgage banking industry generally 
legislation regarding escrow funds certain states require that interest be paid to mortgagors on escrow funds deposited by them to cover mortgage related payments such as property taxes and insurance premiums 
federal legislation has in the past been introduced that would  if enacted  revise current escrow regulations and establish a uniform interest payment requirement in all states 
if such federal legislation were enacted or if additional states enact legislation relating to payment of  or increases in the rate of interest on escrow balances  or if such legislation were retroactively applied to loans in the company s servicing portfolio  the company s earnings would be adversely affected 
delinquency and default the company s profitability may be negatively impacted by economic downturns because  during such periods  the frequency of loan delinquencies and defaults tends to increase  thereby increasing defaults and loan losses on loans held in portfolio for long term investment and increasing the cost to service the loans in the company s servicing portfolio 
also  the company is generally at risk for delinquency or default of newly originated or purchased loans 
in the case of conventional loans  the company is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from origination or purchase by the company  as the case may be  until the loan is sold typically less than days 
once the company sells the loan  the risk of loss from mortgage loan default and foreclosure generally passes to the purchaser or insurer of the loan 
the company has from the time an fha or va mortgage loan is originated or purchased until the first payment is due  a minimum of days  to request insurance or a guarantee certificate from the fha and the va  respectively 
once the insurance or the guarantee certificate is issued  the company has no risk of default or foreclosure except with respect to certain losses related to foreclosures of fha mortgage loans and losses that exceed the va s guarantee limitation 
moreover  under certain types of servicing contracts  particularly contracts to service loans that have been pooled or securitized  the servicer must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of the loan  even when loan payments are delinquent 
also  to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require the servicer to advance mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are unavailable 
prior to the liquidation of a loan  the servicer must absorb the cost of funds advanced during the time the advance is outstanding 
further  the servicer must bear the increased costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
the servicer generally is reimbursed for such advances ultimately by the mortgage loan owner or from liquidation proceeds 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be extinguished as a result of foreclosure proceedings  and any servicing income will cease 
as a consequence  the company will forego servicing income from the time such loan becomes delinquent until it is foreclosed upon or is brought current 
the company maintains a reserve for possible losses at a level considered adequate to provide for known and inherent risks related to foreclosure and disposition losses 
the company s evaluation of an adequate level of foreclosure reserves considers past loss experience  industry loss experience  geographic and product concentrations  delinquency trends  economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the company uses currently available information to make such evaluation  therefore  future adjustments to the foreclosure reserve will be required as conditions and assumptions are revised in response to changes in trends and the other factors and assumptions relevant to the company s evaluation 
with respect to va loans  the va guarantees the initial losses on a loan 
the guaranteed amount generally ranges from to of the original principal balance 
before each foreclosure sale  the va determines whether to bid to purchase the foreclosed loan by comparing the estimated net sale proceeds to the outstanding principal balance and the servicer s accumulated reimbursable costs and fees 
if this amount is a loss and exceeds the guaranteed amount  the va typically issues a no bid and pays the servicer the guaranteed amount 
whenever a no bid is issued  the servicer absorbs the loss  if any  in excess of the sum of the guaranteed principal and amounts recovered at the foreclosure sale 
the company s historical delinquency and foreclosure rate experience on va loans has generally been consistent with that of the industry 
in the case of loans insured by the fha  the company will not be reimbursed for certain amounts if foreclosure becomes necessary 
such amounts include interest on the mortgage loan for the first two months subsequent to the loan becoming delinquent and a portion of the costs of foreclosure generally the unreimbursed amount of such costs is limited to one third of such costs 
changes in the market for mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights volume of mortgage loans produced 
during periods of declining interest rates  the company typically experiences an increase in loan originations because of increased home purchases and  particularly  increased refinancing activity 
increases in interest rates typically adversely affect refinancing activity  which has an adverse effect on the company s origination revenues 
for the year ended december   of the company s mortgage loan production was attributable to refinancings  compared to during sales of mortgage loans 
gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans may result from changes in interest rates from the time the interest rate on a customer s mortgage loan application is established to the time the company sells the loan 
at any given time  the company has committed to sell substantially all of its agency eligible mortgage loans that are closed and a percentage of the agency eligible mortgage loans that are not yet closed but for which the interest rate has been established rate locks 
to manage the interest rate risk of the company s rate locks  the company continuously projects the percentage of the rate locks it expects to close and  on the basis of such projections  enters into forward sales commitments to sell such loans 
to reduce the effect of such interest rate changes  the company employs a variety of techniques  currently consisting of a combination of mandatory forward sales commitments for mortgage backed securities and put and call option contracts on us treasuries 
if interest rates make an unanticipated change  the actual percentage of rate locks that close may differ from the projected percentage 
a sudden increase in interest rates can cause a higher percentage of rate locks to close than projected 
to the degree that this may not have been anticipated  the company may not have made forward sales commitments to sell these additional loans and consequently may incur significant losses upon their sale at current market prices  adversely affecting results of operations 
likewise  if a lower percentage of rate locks close than was projected  due to a sudden decrease in interest rates or otherwise  the company may have committed to sell more than actually close and as a result may incur significant losses in fulfilling these commitments  adversely affecting results of operations 
this risk is greater during times of interest rate volatility 
value of mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the company s servicing portfolio may be adversely affected if mortgage interest rates decline and loan refinancings and prepayments increase 
in periods of declining interest rates  the economic advantages to borrowers of refinancing their mortgage loans become greater 
increases in the rate of mortgage loan prepayments reduce the period during which the company receives servicing income from such loans 
the company capitalizes the cost of the acquisition of servicing rights from third parties and capitalizes a value for the servicing rights on loans that it originates 
the value of servicing rights is based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the rate of prepayment of the related loans exceeds the rate assumed by the company  due to a significant reduction in interest rates or otherwise  the value of the company s servicing portfolio will decrease and accelerated amortization of servicing rights or recognition of an impairment provision may become necessary  thereby decreasing earnings 
the company attempts to mitigate these risks with respect to the value of its servicing rights by maintaining a portfolio of interest rate option and other derivative contracts whose value tends to increase in periods of declining interest rates  thus mitigating the decline in value typical during the same period with respect to servicing rights 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to mitigate these risks will prevent value loss or impairment provisions 
sales of mortgage servicing rights 
the prices obtained by the company upon the sale of its mortgage servicing rights depend upon a number of factors  including the general supply of and demand for mortgage servicing rights  as well as prepayment and delinquency rates on the portfolio of mortgage servicing rights being sold 
interest rate changes can affect the ability to sell  or the profitability of a sale of  mortgage servicing rights 
purchasers of mortgage servicing rights analyze a variety of factors  including prepayment sensitivity of loans underlying servicing rights  to determine the purchase price they are willing to pay 
thus  in periods of declining interest rates  sales of mortgage servicing rights related to higher interest rate loans may be less profitable than sales of mortgage servicing rights related to lower interest rate loans because it is possible that the loans bearing higher interest rates will be refinanced 
because these factors are largely beyond the control of the company  there can be no assurance that the current level of profitability from the sale of mortgage servicing rights will be maintained 
liabilities under representations and warranties in the ordinary course of business  the company makes representations and warranties to the purchasers and insurers of its mortgage loans and the purchasers of mortgage servicing rights regarding compliance with laws  regulations and program standards and as to accuracy of information 
under certain circumstances  the company may become liable for certain damages or may be required to repurchase a loan if there has been a breach of representations or warranties 
the company generally receives similar representations and warranties from the correspondents from whom it purchases loans 
however  in the event of breaches of such representations and warranties  the company is subject to the risk that a correspondent may not have the financial capacity to repurchase loans when called upon to do so by the company or otherwise may not respond to demands made by the company 
the company estimates its liability with respect to such representations and warranties based upon a vintage analysis of repurchases of loans by year of production 
since the company no longer services the vast majority of loans and servicing sold in prior years  the company is unable to calculate the amount of loans still outstanding for which such representations and warranties relate 
for example  increases or decreases in prepayments of loans and servicing previously sold can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the amount of representation and warranty claims ultimately asserted 
therefore  there is no assurance that future claims for representations and warranties will be similar to the company s experience as depicted in its vintage analysis 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the company s liabilities under representations and warranties  including the past repurchase and current reserve information 
environmental matters in the course of its business  through the foreclosure process  the company has acquired  and may acquire in the future  properties securing loans that are in default 
although the company lends to owners of residential properties  there is a risk that the company could be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties after its acquisition and might be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury and investigation or cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
to date  the company has not been required to perform any investigation or cleanup activities of any material nature  nor has the company been subject to any environmental claims 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will remain the case in the future 
dependence upon independent mortgage brokers and mortgage bankers the company depends largely upon independent mortgage bankers  including smaller mortgage companies and commercial banks  and  to a lesser extent  upon independent mortgage brokers  for its originations and purchases of mortgage loans 
substantially all of the independent mortgage brokers and mortgage bankers with whom the company does business deal with multiple loan originators for each prospective borrower 
wholesale lenders compete for business based upon pricing  service  loan fees and costs and other factors 
the company s competitors also seek to establish relationships with the same independent mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers with whom the company seeks to do business  none of whom is obligated by contract or otherwise to continue to do business with the company 
future operating and financial results of the company will be susceptible to fluctuations in the volume and cost of its broker and mortgage banker sourced loans resulting from  among other things  competition from other purchasers of such loans 
possible changes in accounting estimates in preparing the company s financial statements  management is required to make estimates based on available information that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosures as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses for the related periods 
such estimates relate principally to the company s reserves for foreclosure losses and repurchased loans  its reserve for representation and warranty claims for previous sales of loans and mortgage servicing rights  and its allowances for credit losses on its loan and lease receivables 
additionally  estimates concerning the fair values of mortgage loans held for sale  servicing rights  servicing hedges and the company s other hedging instruments are all relevant to ensuring that mortgage loans are carried at the lower of cost or market  and that potential impairments of servicing rights are recognized as and if required 
because of the inherent uncertainties associated with any estimation process and due to possible future changes in market and economic conditions that will affect fair values  it is possible that actual future results in realization of the underlying assets and liabilities could differ significantly from the amounts reflected as of the balance sheet date 
see the heading critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 
federal programs availability of active secondary market the company s ability to generate revenue through sales of mortgage backed securities is largely dependent upon the continuation of programs administered by fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  which facilitate the issuance of such securities  as well as the company s continued eligibility to participate in such programs 
the company anticipates that it will continue to remain eligible to participate in such programs  but any significant impairment of such eligibility would materially adversely affect its operations 
in addition  the mortgage loan products eligible for such programs may be changed from time to time by the sponsor 
the profitability of specific types of mortgage loan products may vary depending on a number of factors  including the administrative costs to the company of originating or purchasing such types of mortgage loans 
proposals are being considered in congress and by various regulators that would affect the manner in which these agencies conduct their businesses 
these proposals include establishing a new independent regulatory authority to regulate these agencies  increasing the authority of the securities and exchange commission over these agencies  and reducing or limiting the benefits these agencies receive from the federal government 
in addition  the accounting practices employed by these agencies are being investigated  and to some extent have been alleged to be improper  by various regulatory authorities 
these proposals  if enacted  and the results of these investigations could have an adverse impact on these agencies and in turn on the company s business

interstate netbank v 
netbank  inc and netbank  case no 
cv jbs district of new jersey on june   the company was served with a complaint for a declaratory judgment filed by interstate netbank in the district of new jersey challenging the netbank service mark 
the company answered and counterclaimed for trademark infringement on july  discovery was stayed pending a ruling on interstate netbank s november  motion for summary judgment  which claimed that netbank is generic for all banking services delivered over the internet 
on september   the district court ruled that netbank is generic for online banking services but did not cancel the company s existing service mark registration at that time 
the company filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court s decision 
on june   the district court denied the company s motion for reconsideration but clarified that two of the company s counterclaims remained in the case a claim for infringement of the company s netbank service mark to the extent that it covers online bill payment services as opposed to online banking services in general and a claim for unfair competition under new jersey law 
the parties completed fact discovery on february  on april   interstate netbank filed a second motion for summary judgment  seeking the dismissal of the remaining two claims brought by netbank  as well as an award of attorneys fees 
on december   the district court granted interstate net bank s second motion for summary judgment  dismissing the company s claims for infringement and unfair competition 
the district court also canceled the company s service mark registration 
the district court did not award interstate netbank its attorneys fees as requested in its motion for summary judgment  finding that the company litigated its claims in good faith 
the company has decided not to appeal the district court s rulings on both motions for summary judgment 
the company believes it has built value in the netbank brand 
the court s ruling does not prohibit the company from continuing to use and develop national recognition of the brand

netbank s management capitalized on the favorable interest rate environment in to post strong revenues from its financial intermediary segment 
in contrast  rising interest rates and interest rate volatility during adversely affected the results reported from the financial intermediary segment 
mortgage production within the financial intermediary segment dropped from billion to billion  while sales of mortgages dropped from billion to billion comparing to  respectively 
netbank also experienced pressure on its margins in the financial intermediary segment from increasing competition  especially in the correspondent channel 
the financial intermediary segment s pre tax income  as a result  went from  in to  in as a result of the potential volatility in its financial intermediary segment  netbank announced in its intention to diversify its sources of revenue 
it set a long term goal of achieving an equal balance of earnings between its retail banking  financial intermediary and transaction processing segments 
although the volatility in the financial intermediary segment manifested itself during  resulting in reduced earnings on a consolidated basis  the company made significant progress in growing the earnings and earnings capabilities of the other two segments 
during and  the retail banking segment implemented a number of strategies to improve earnings 
it restructured its portfolio of assets away from higher to lower risk loans 
it prepaid a large number of higher costing  term fhlb advances 
it became a warehouse bank for the financial intermediary segment  and it commenced hedging a portion of the interest rate risk of its servicing assets on balance sheet with agency mortgage backed securities held available for sale 
as a result  the retail banking segment s pre tax results improved by  to  for the year ended december  compared with the same period in in the absence of the  provision on the leases acquired from cmc  the reported improvement would have been  the transaction processing segment reported an improvement in pre tax earnings of  this resulted from improved expense control and an increase in average loans serviced by its servicing operations 
likewise  the acquisition of nps late in added  of pre tax earnings to the transaction processing segment s results for future outlook the company is excited about the progress that it has made in becoming a premier provider of financial products and services to its targeted market segments 
netbank s strategy is multi faceted  involving retail banking 
netbank  fsb operates as an fdic insured  federally chartered thrift institution that currently serves over  customers throughout the united states and in more than foreign countries 
netbank  fsb operates a totally branchless model and passes on a portion of the cost savings to its customers in the form of attractive yields on deposits 
netbank  fsb s array of products and services are available to its customers hours per day  seven days a week  and all days during the year 
financial intermediary 
through its mortgage banking operations  the company serves as an intermediary between consumers and institutional investors 
the company obtains mortgage loans by originating loans directly with consumers or through brokers or by buying closed loans from a network of correspondent banks  thrifts and independent mortgage companies 
the majority of these loans are held for sale on the company s balance sheet prior to delivery into the secondary market 
the company thus earns a long term yield  on an asset held short term  and also earns origination and servicing revenues and gains on the sale of the mortgages or resulting mortgage backed securities 
transaction processing 
the following summarizes netbank s transaction processing initiatives netbank runs a servicing factory that services over  loans for internal and external customers 
late in  the company expanded its transaction processing capabilities by acquiring nps 
nps is one of the top five providers of atm services for retail and non bank businesses  and netbank has the nd largest bank atm network in the country 
at december   through organic growth and acquisition  nps serviced approximately  atm machines and  merchant processing terminals 
check legislation was passed by congress in the fall of  and it became effective on october  banks may now clear checks through substitutes such as digital images 
the checks may be truncated  customers may be provided images of checks  and banks may exchange data instead of physical checks 
netbank has built a new processing engine that can do ach and check clearing 
netbank plans to offer these payment processing services to community banks 
netbank already offers mortgage processing services to community banks 
late in  netbank announced its strategy to diversify its earnings so that one third of its earnings are provided by each of its principal operating segments retail banking  financial intermediary and transaction processing 
the following summarizes pre tax income by segment for the years ended december  and the retail banking segment results for includes a million provision for credit losses on its cmc lease portfolio as discussed below 
retail banking financial intermediary transaction processing other eliminations total absent the million charge for cmc  the retail banking segment would have contributed  of pre tax income 
netbank is pleased with the progress made in in expanding its earnings from its retail banking and transaction processing segments 
netbank believes that its deposit base will continue to grow as internet usage and internet based commerce grow 
netbank believes that it can continue to invest those deposits profitably in mortgage loans held temporarily for sale and loans held for investment 
netbank also believes that its non interest earnings in the form of fees and gain on sale resulting from its financial intermediary and transaction processing activities will provide a better diversity of earnings than the traditional banking model 
while netbank is optimistic about its short and long term prospects  the following should be considered in evaluating its earnings and growth outlook 
volatility of mortgage banking income 
all of netbank s earnings in came from its financial intermediary segment 
mortgage interest rates during were at historically low levels 
this prompted refinance and home purchase mortgage volumes to grow to the highest levels in history 
total mortgage industry production volumes were just under trillion for interest rates began climbing during the third quarter of  and mortgage banking industry production volumes dropped to an estimated trillion during as volumes dropped  competitive pressures heated up resulting in a drop in gain on sale margins in compared with the mortgage bankers association of america s forecast calls for total mortgage production of just over trillion for  representing an drop in volume from although the company believes that its offerings of adjustable rate products and non conforming loan products will soften some of the impact of declines in available volume  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain current levels of production volumes 
likewise  there is no assurance that the current competitive pressures will subside 
the following summarizes some of the major potential threats and opportunities of this reduced volume scenario total production volume could decline  resulting in less net interest margin on loans held for sale  less gain on sale  and less production related fee revenue 
gain on sale margins could remain at present levels or drift even lower due to increased competition for available mortgage application volume 
production costs per unit could rise as the result of a reduction in leverage gained on fixed costs fixed costs are spread over a smaller number of units 
this impact may be offset  in part  by the following additional potential effects of the rising rate environment the value of servicing rights could increase as actual and forecasted prepayments go down 
although these assets are carried at the lower of cost or market  accounting rules allow for the reversal of previously provided reserves for impairment 
at december   such reserves aggregated million 
servicing hedge values would go down  offsetting a portion of the reserve recovery 
with reduced prepayments  servicing revenues would improve 
the company could elect to take a portion of existing excess liquidity and liquidity freed up by the reduced loan production volume and invest in additional interest earning assets at the  then  higher interest rates 
material pending litigation 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company is involved in litigation with three insurance companies who are sureties on some of netbank  fsb s commercial lease portfolios 
netbank  fsb has filed a claim for payments that are currently past due 
during  in response to settlements between the sureties and other holders of cmc leases  netbank recorded an additional million in allowance for credit losses and wrote its carrying value on the cmc leases down by million resulting in a remaining balance of million 
the entire portfolio is on non accrual status 
the discovery stage of the lawsuits against the sureties is now essentially complete 
although the company believes that its case against the insurance companies is strong  there is no assurance that the suit will ultimately be decided in netbank  fsb s favor nor is there any assurance as to the length of time it may take the company to prevail 
the following summarizes the material impact some of the possible outcomes could have on the results of the company s operations for and beyond a victory in the action or favorable settlement could result in the company being able to recover a portion of its cmc lease receivables charged off in  a loss in the litigation or adverse settlement could result in the company recording additional provisions for loss on these assets and the continuation of non accrual status  prolonged litigation could result in the continuation of non accrual status  continued payment of large legal fees  and the potential for recording additional provisions for losses on these assets in the future 
acquisitions 
as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  during netbank expanded its atm and merchant processing business by acquiring smaller processors or service contracts  expanded its retail mortgage origination operations by acquiring branches of guaranty residential lending  inc  and acquired the operating assets of beacon credit services  llc 
the company does not expect to acquire a business that would be considered material ie of pre tax income  total assets or total shareholders equity in the near future  however  netbank will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions such as these which fit into its long term strategy of diversifying its earnings by expanding its less cyclical revenue generating operations 
financial condition general 
netbank s assets totaled  at december   a decrease of  or from december  this decrease is primarily due to the following factors 
first  as a result of a higher interest rate environment  loans produced for sale by the financial intermediary segment went down 
this resulted in a reduction in loans held for sale of  when comparing the balances at december  and this reduction was offset by an increase in loan and lease receivables and an increase in investment securities available for sale 
investment securities available for sale increased as a result of purchases of u 
s 
government agency securities related to an economic hedge of the company s investment in mortgage servicing rights 
liabilities shrank by  related primarily to a reduction in unsettled trades year over year 
the increase in deposits of  was offset by a reduction in other borrowed funds of  investment securities 
in  the company began a program of hedging on the balance sheet  from an economic standpoint  a portion of the prepayment risk associated with its mortgage servicing rights 
that program involves acquiring mortgage backed securities by entering into tba trades and subsequently taking delivery of the resulting securities on respective agency settlement dates 
the increase in investment securities from december  to december   relates primarily to u 
s 
government agency mortgage backed securities acquired pursuant to this hedging strategy

loans held for sale 
for the year ended december   loans held for sale  which consist primarily of mortgage loans  declined by  to  compared to  as of december  this large decline is the result of declining production volumes during industry wide production of mortgages decreased during primarily as a result of an increase in long term mortgage interest rates and generally softer demand following record mortgage production levels in loan and lease receivables 
for the year ended december   the loan and lease receivables portfolio increased  million or 
loan and lease receivables increased as a result of selectively retaining originated loans and leases 
during  netbank retained  of internally originated mortgage loans primarily adjustable rate mortgages   of helocs   of internally originated auto loans and  of originated business finance loans and leases 
the retention of these internally originated assets was offset  in part  by the sale of  of mortgage loans and normal principal reductions and prepayments

see item legal proceedings  and notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the company s loan and lease receivables  including its investment in the cmc lease portfolio  the associated litigation and the associated allowance for credit losses 
the non cmc leases are originated by the company s netbank business finance division 
these leases consist primarily of equipment leases to small businesses 
the company provides an allowance for credit losses on such leases based upon life of lease loss estimates resulting from static loss analysis by vintage year of production 
the increase in the non cmc related reserves relates to the retention of leases by the company over time 
during and  the company s portfolios of first mortgages grew as a result of the retention of targeted products from the company s mortgage banking operations 
the company provides an allowance for credit losses on all mortgage products based on a life of loan estimate of losses 
such life of loan loss estimates are based upon rating agency estimates of losses for mortgage backed securities containing loans with similar credit quality 
the company s allocated allowance for credit losses  accordingly  grew from  to  for first mortgages from december  to december  as the result of an increase in the underlying portfolios from  to  during the two year period 
the company s allocated allowance for credit losses for second mortgages decreased from  to  from december  to december  related to a decrease of principal balance relating to payoffs of second mortgages and retention of selected second mortgages to borrowers with higher credit scores  resulting in reduced loss estimates as a percentage of outstanding principal 
in the spring of  the company opened its dealer financial services division for the purpose of originating indirect auto loans through a third party network of regional auto dealers 
for such auto loans  the company provides  at a minimum  allowances based upon loss estimates for the succeeding twelve months for each vintage year of production 
its loss estimates are based primarily on the credit scores of the underlying borrowers 
the company monitors its actual loss experience vs 
its expected loss experience and makes appropriate adjustments to its provision and allowance 
asset quality and non performing assets 
the company periodically reviews the performance of its loan and lease receivables by reviewing charge offs  delinquency statistics and various other industry statistics 
large non homogeneous credits are reviewed on a loan by loan or lease by lease basis  whereas relatively small credits with similar risk characteristics are reviewed on a pool by pool basis 
if a decline in credit quality for a specific pool or individual loan or lease is noted  the company records additional allowance through a charge to the provision for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan and lease receivables portfolio 
the company determines the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual loans and leases  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans and leases and other pertinent factors 
netbank s non performing loan and lease receivables as a percentage of gross unpaid principal balance upb improved from at december   to at december  the level of non performing assets declined during primarily related to the million write off of the cmc lease portfolio

as more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  netbank s loans held for sale are carried at the aggregate of the lower of cost or market until being sold  typically to days after origination or purchase 
the majority of netbank s non performing loans held for sale consist of loans which the company has been required to repurchase under representations and warranties provided to purchasers of netbank s loans 
once a loan has been repurchased  it is generally resold at a loss 
upon repurchase  the company transfers reserves from its liability for representations and warranties to a valuation reserve for repurchased loans to record such loans at estimated net realizable value 
at december  and the aggregate market value of loans held for sale exceeded the aggregate cost

the company intends to grow the size of its mortgage servicing rights msrs portfolio in order to achieve the necessary critical mass the transaction processing segment requires to sustain operational profitably 
during  execution of conforming conventional loans into the secondary market in whole loan  servicing released sales was frequently more profitable than creating mortgage backed securities and retaining the servicing rights 
accordingly  growth in the servicing portfolio was slower during when compared with for the year ended december   the value of netbank s msrs increased  or 
the  increase in value was driven by the  or increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans underlying its msrs coupled with a basis point increase in carrying value as a percent of unpaid principal balance

in addition  for the years ended december   and the company incurred amortization expense of   and  respectively  related to its msrs 
liabilities 
total liabilities for the year ended december  decreased  this decrease was due primarily to a decrease of  in borrowed funds and a decrease of  in unsettled trades 
these decreases were offset  in part  by an increase in deposits of  the increase in deposits relates primarily to an increase in servicing related deposits and small business deposits during borrowed funds decreased as a result of the overall  decrease in total assets primarily related to the decrease in loans held for sale

checking accounts increased primarily related to the growth in servicing related deposits and small business accounts 
money market accounts decreased year over year related primarily to the company pricing less aggressively than it did in prior periods relative to its competition 
certificates of deposit increased by  as the company saw the opportunity to lock in rates in certain maturities in a rising rate environment

shareholders equity 
total shareholders equity decreased  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a  increase in treasury stock and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of  net income was  and dividends paid aggregated  for the year ended december  accumulated other comprehensive income oci decreased  as a result of the change in fair value of available for sale investment securities of and the realization of  in gains due to the sale of certain investment securities

netbank will continue to repurchase shares periodically in the public market or through private transactions 
at december    shares remained available for repurchase under current board authority 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission s proposed rule disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about the application of critical accounting policies  the company s senior management  in conjunction with the audit committee of the board of directors  has identified valuation of mortgage servicing rights available for sale  determination of the allowance for credit losses  liabilities for representations and warranties on loans and mortgage servicing rights sold and derivatives hedging mortgage servicing rights available for sale as being the most critical accounting policies 
these policies were identified as being the most critical based on the sec s guidance in identifying them based on whether the accounting estimate required management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or results of operations 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
as more fully described in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  netbank accounts for its mortgage servicing rights under the guidance set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
for purposes of evaluating netbank s mortgage servicing rights portfolio for impairment  the company disaggregates its servicing portfolio into two primary groupings available for sale and held for sale 
the most important variables that require management to make estimates in the valuation of netbank s mortgage servicing rights available for sale are the prepayment rate and discount rate 
in determining the appropriate prepayment rate and discount rate to be used in its internal valuation models  netbank reviews current prepayment activities  historical prepayment activities  prevailing interest rates  general economic indicators and the secondary market for mortgage servicing rights 
the following table sets forth the change in value of the available for sale portfolio that would theoretically be recorded were management to choose to use a prepayment or discount rate that is or more adverse 
fair value weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change the impacts displayed above for the available for sale portfolio would be a direct reduction to the value of mortgage servicing rights available for sale and a reduction of income by a nearly corresponding amount via an impairment charge 
the sensitivities above are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in an assumption generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the table above  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the available for sale servicing rights portfolio is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
netbank holds an additional  of mortgage servicing rights that management considers held for sale  which are not included in the preceding table 
the held for sale portfolio s value is based on its forward committed prices and therefore would not be subject to the types of value changes referred to in the discussion above 
allowance for credit losses 
in determining the appropriate amount of allowance for credit losses management is required to make estimates regarding the credit quality of borrowers  general economic conditions and various other factors that would impact the probability of loans or leases being repaid in full 
accordingly  management uses both internally developed and external metrics and considers economic indicators as well as other factors to determine the appropriate range level at which the allowance should be maintained 
at december   netbank had billion of loan and lease receivables and  of allowance for credit losses  a coverage ratio of  and incurred  of provision expense related to maintaining the allowance within the appropriate range 
netbank recorded net charge offs of  during the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  included a provision related to leases originated by cmc which the company is litigating to recover 
in november  two settlements in other cmc related cases were announced that were considered significant 
americana bancorp and lakeland bancorp both announced settlements with american motorist insurance company and royal indemnity  respectively 
based upon a review of publicly available information  these settlements appear to represent between and of the recorded receivable before allocated reserves 
although the case against the sureties is still believed to be very strong  netbank recorded a provision of  and charged off  which resulted in a remaining balance of  excluding this provision and chargeoff for cmc  the provision expense was  and net chargeoffs were  at december   the company had billion of loan and lease receivables and  of allowance  a coverage ratio of 
the company incurred  of provision expense related to maintaining the allowance within the appropriate range during netbank recorded net charge offs of  which was less than of the average loan and lease receivables balance during the allowance for credit losses at december  contained  specifically allocated to the cmc lease portfolio

in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to liability  and potential losses  under representations and warranties made to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans and the purchasers of servicing rights 
under certain circumstances  the company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify the purchasers of loans or servicing rights for losses if there has been a breach of representations or warranties 
estimation of a liability for such representations and warranties is difficult for two reasons 
first  since netbank is not the primary servicer for many of the loans or loans underlying the mortgage servicing rights it has sold in the past  it has no knowledge as to the current status of previously sold loans and mortgage servicing rights and the extent of the pipeline of unasserted repurchase requests 
second  as new mortgage products are introduced that may have documentation or underwriting criteria substantially different from products historically originated and sold  the company has no historic information with respect to the expected frequency of repurchase requests or of the expected loss severity for these new products 
the company estimates its liability for representations and warranties using the best information it has in the circumstances 
for loan products where the company has a history of past repurchase frequency and loss severity  the company uses that historical vintage loss data to project its future liability 
however  since the company is not the servicer and has no information of the current status of such loans  such historic repurchase frequency and loss severity may not be the best indicator of future repurchase losses as the result of changes in the levels of prepayments which affect repurchase frequency 
likewise  changes in general economic conditions such as unemployment levels and housing values can affect the frequency and loss severity of future repurchases under representations and warranties 
for new products that are substantially different in underwriting criteria and documentation standards than that of historic product offerings  the company initially estimates repurchase frequency from initial quality control tests and uses loss severity from other similar products 
as these new products season  the company adjusts its process to include the historical frequency and loss severity trends for the product 
the company s reserve for its estimated losses for its liability for representations and warranties was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
changes to frequency or severity would cause linear changes to the reserve requirements 
the company repurchased approximately million and million of unpaid principal balances during and  respectively 
derivative financial instruments 
the company uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk management activities to protect the value of certain assets and liabilities against adverse price or interest rate movements 
all of the company s derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
the valuation of these derivatives is critical because carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the valuation of the company s derivatives is based on third party mid market quotes from a cross section of wall street dealers or from a model utilizing wall street accepted valuation methodologies  and is therefore  generally calibrated to third party mid market quotes 
because the majority of the derivative instruments on the company s balance sheet are used to protect the value of other assets and liabilities in its balance sheet  changes in the value of the derivative instruments are typically offset by changes in the value of the assets and liabilities being hedged 
income statement volatility can occur if the company makes the decision to not fully hedge the attendant risk  the costs related to hedging reduce the net benefit related to hedging the attendant risk or the derivative instruments are not effective in hedging changes in the value of those assets and liabilities 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the company  in the normal course of business  had contractual obligations to make scheduled payments for its operating leases  its liability to repurchase loans under representations and warranties provided to purchasers of its mortgage loans and msrs  and its obligation to make scheduled principal and interest payments on borrowed funds 
the company is not a party to any off balance sheet financing arrangements nor does it hold unconsolidated interests in any variable interest entities that could rise to future contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the company s obligations under these arrangements by type and scheduled payment contractual obligations less than year years years after years total borrowed funds unsettled trades operating leases repurchase liabilities includes contractually due principal and interest

as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and under the heading critical accounting policies above  the company cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of when  or if  mortgage loans or mortgage servicing rights will be presented for repurchase 
results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  general 
net income for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share  for netbank s management capitalized on the favorable interest rate environment in to post strong revenues from its financial intermediary segment 
in contrast  rising interest rates and interest rate volatility during adversely impacted the results reported from the financial intermediary segment 
mortgage production within the financial intermediary segment dropped from billion to billion  while sales of mortgages dropped from billion to billion comparing to  respectively 
netbank also experienced pressure on its margins in the financial intermediary segment from increasing competition  especially in the correspondent channel 
the financial intermediary segment s pre tax income was down by million as a result 
this was offset  in part  by improved results in the retail bank segment which posted a pre tax loss of million during compared with a pre tax loss of million during included in the retail bank segment loss in was an additional provision for credit losses on the cmc leases of million 
in the absence of that provision  the retail bank would have reported pre tax earnings of million an improvement of million over the prior year 
interest income 
netbank s interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  in as detailed in the following rate volume variance table  netbank lowered the average balance of its loans held for sale by  and increased the average balance of investment securities available for sale and loan and lease receivables by  and  respectively 
this repositioning resulted in a positive volume variance of  due to the increase in average interest earning assets 
this was partially offset by a  negative variance due to lower yields 
the increase in loan and lease receivables is principally the result of the bank retaining originated loans and leases 
during  netbank retained  of internally originated mortgage loans primarily adjustable rate mortgages   of helocs   of internally originated auto loans and  of originated business finance loans and leases 
interest income was impacted for the years ended december  and by approximately million and million  respectively  due to the non accrual status of loans and leases interest expense 
total interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the  increase is due to an increase of  in interest bearing liabilities  offset  in part  by the impact of a basis point reduction in the average cost of funds 
for the year ended december  there was  of interest expense on deposits including checking  money market and certificates of deposits as compared to  for the year ended december  the  net decrease in interest expense on deposits was the result of a basis point decline in the average rate paid on deposits resulting in a positive  rate variance  offset in part by a volume variance of due to an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances of  for the year ended december  interest expense on other borrowed funds including short term debt  fhlb advances  and convertible subordinated debt was  compared to  for the  increase in interest expense related to other borrowed funds is the result of an increase of  in the average outstanding balance  offset  in part  by a basis point decline in the average cost of funds 
the basis point reduction in the average cost of other borrowed funds is primarily due to higher fixed rate term fhlb advances being prepaid during the second half of net interest income 
net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december   compared to  or  of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  the following table details the relative interest rates and average balances of netbank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december   and average yield rate variance attributable to average balance interest rate volume variance interest earning assets short term investments investment securities loans held for sale loan and lease receivables total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities checking accounts money market certificates of deposit short term debt fhlb advances subordinated debt convertible subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities net interest margin interest free sources net interest income to interest earning assets based on amortized cost  changes in fair value are not considered 
no separate treatment has been made for non accrual loans 
variances attributable to the rate and volume mix are included in the volume variances 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase in provision relates to recording a  provision during the fourth quarter for the company s aforementioned investment in leases originated by cmc 
in november  two settlements in other cmc related cases were announced that were considered significant 
ameriana bancorp and lakeland bancorp both announced settlements with american motorist insurance company and royal indemnity  respectively 
based upon a review of publicly available information  these settlements appear to represent between and of the recorded receivable before allocated reserves 
netbank believes its case against the sureties is still very strong 
excluding this provision for cmc  the provision expense was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the reduction in provision expense  excluding the cmc provision  relates to a slowdown in the growth of loan and lease receivables 
during  loan and lease receivables grew by  compared with growth in of  reference is made to the heading financial condition asset quality and non performing assets above for additional detail concerning the determination of provision expense related to maintaining the proper level of allowance for credit losses 
non interest income 
non interest income declined by  for the year ended december  compared to the same period of this decline was primarily driven by the  decline in gain on sales of loans due to the billion or decline in sales of mortgage loans 
the decline in sales was compounded by the decline in margins on sales due to increased competitive pressures 
service charges and fees increased  as a result of an increase in the average number of loans serviced in compared with and inclusion of a full year of operating results of nps during  which was acquired on december  gain on sales of securities declined by  and gains on derivatives increased by  during the year ended december  compared with the same period in during  the company was re balancing the durations of its asset liability mix  offsetting fees for prepayment of higher rate term debt with gains on the sale of selected securities available for sale 
during  the company did not prepay any fhlb advances 
in  the company began a program of hedging on the balance sheet  from an economic standpoint  a portion of the prepayment risk associated with its mortgage servicing rights 
that program involves acquiring mortgage backed securities by entering into tba trades and subsequently taking delivery of the resulting securities on respective agency settlement dates 
the tba trades prior to settlement are free standing derivatives that are marked to market 
in  this gave rise to the gains on derivatives 
likewise  the company monetized a portion of its gain on some of the resulting mortgage backed securities available for sale giving rise to a total of million of gains on sale of securities 
other income declined by  primarily due to lower hedge results driven by generally increasing mortgage interest rates and interest rate volatility compared to the same period of non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all operating expenses such as salaries and benefits  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
non interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period of this decline was primarily driven by the  decline in impairment and amortization of mortgage servicing rights due to the reduction in actual and projected prepayments  reduced salaries and benefits expense of  related primarily to reduced production volume in the financial intermediary segment   reduced prepayment fees on the early extinguishment of debt related to the extinguishment of term fhlb borrowings in  and a reduction in prepaid lost interest on curtailments of  related to reduced actual prepayments on loans serviced in compared with these decreases were offset  in part  by depreciation and amortization  occupancy and other expense categories that were generally higher as the company s operations expanded period over period with the additions of netbank dealer financial services and nps 
retail banking segment 
the table below provides an overview of the results of operations for the retail banking segment change net interest income provision for credit losses net interest income after provision gain on sale of loans fees  charges and other income total revenues total expenses pre tax income before gains on securities  debt and net servicing results net gain on securities and prepaid debt net servicing results pre tax income loss earning assets average upb underlying msrs efficiencies to earning assets net interest income provision net interest income after provision gain on sale  fees  charges and other income banking revenues total expenses pre tax income before net gains on securities  debt and net servicing results net servicing results to upb underlying msrs pre tax loss improved by  to  for the year ended december   compared with a pre tax loss of  for the same period in this is in spite of recording an additional provision for credit losses related to the company s investment in cmc leases 
in the absence of that charge  the improvement would have been  improvements in net interest income of  improvements in net servicing results of  improvement in net gain on securities and prepayment of debt of  and increases in fees  charges and other income of  resulted in the improvement year over year 
net interest income improved primarily because of the retention over the past two years of originated assets including mortgages  leases and auto loans 
likewise  during  the retail banking segment prepaid a large number of higher priced term fhlb advances and  through pricing  moved the mix of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost money market and checking accounts 
these asset liability strategies have improved net interest income as a percentage of earning assets by to for the year ended december  compared with for the same period in net servicing results improved as a result of lower actual and projected prepayments in compared with the increase in the provision for credit losses relates to the aforementioned provision for losses on the company s investment in leases acquired from cmc 
the improvement in fees  charges and other income relates to the increase in transactional accounts ie checking and money market year over year 
these improvements in earnings were offset  in part  by increases in operating expenses of  the increase in operating expenses relates primarily to the growth in the company s auto lending operation 
financial intermediary segment 
the following table highlights the financial intermediary segment production and sales activities change net interest income gain on sales of loans other income net beacon credit services results net mg reinsurance results total revenues salary and employee benefits occupancy depreciation expense other expenses total expenses pre tax income production sales total revenues to sales total expenses to production pre tax margin note the ratio of revenues to sales is based on mortgage banking sales  which includes inter segment sales to the retail banking segment 
the interest rate environment during the year ended december  was much more favorable to mortgage production than the environment during in  mortgage rates were hitting historic lows 
the loan pipelines of originators throughout the mortgage banking industry were filled  resulting in less pressure on margins 
during the latter part of and continuing into  mortgage rates rose  and competitive pressures heated up as pipeline volumes decreased 
this margin pressure was especially true in the correspondent channel 
this resulted in a decrease in mortgage production of billion and a decrease in sales of billion 
the competitive pressures reduced revenue margins from bps for the year ended december  to bps for the year ended december  as a result  revenues decreased  expenses decreased  expenses in terms of basis points of production increased from bps to bps comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  this was the result of less leverage of fixed expenses during transaction processing segment 
the transaction processing segment provides atm and merchant processing services  subservices loans for the retail banking segment  financial intermediary segment and for third party customers  and sells various insurance products using an internet based platform 
the following table highlights the results of operations for the transaction processing segment change total revenue total expenses pre tax income loss the transaction processing segment reported an improvement in pre tax operating results of  the servicing operations showed improved results related primarily to improved expense control and an increase in the average number of loans serviced when comparing with nps  acquired late in the fourth quarter of  added  of pre tax profit to the transaction processing segment s results during other elimination segment 
for the year ended december   the other elimination segment recorded a pre tax loss of  compared to a pre tax loss of  for the same period of this amount represents netbank s holding company expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses 
the elimination of intersegment revenues primarily consist of the deferral of gains associated with the sale of loans to the retail banking segment from the financial intermediary segment and loan servicing fees paid by the retail banking and financial intermediary segments to the transaction processing segment 
results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  general 
netbank s management capitalized on the favorable market conditions during  allowing the company to post record levels in all of the following categories net income of  or per share compared to a loss of  or per share  deposits of billion  a increase over  mortgage loan production of billion  a billion increase over  and mortgage loan sales of billion  a billion increase over management also took advantage of the favorable market conditions to push forward its long term strategy of balancing netbank s operations to provide one third of its total income from each of its major operating segments retail banking  financial intermediary  and transaction processing 
to compare results to results one should note that netbank purchased resource on march   and its results of operations are therefore included in only nine of the twelve months during additionally  netbank incurred approximately million  pre tax  in charges related to integrating resource s operations  million of acquisition and severance costs and million of additional provision expense specifically for the cmc lease portfolio during interest income 
netbank s interest income for the year ended december   was  compared to  for as detailed in the following rate volume variance table  netbank lowered the average balance of its short term investments  investment securities available for sale and loan and lease receivables by   and  respectively  and increased the average balance of its loans held for sale by billion which resulted in a net increase of  in the average balance of interest earning assets 
this repositioning allowed the company to earn long term yields on a greater percentage of its interest earning assets while effectively holding short term held for sale assets 
during  netbank retained billion of internally originated mortgage loans  million of auto loans and million in small business equipment leases 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company did not accrue and has not received approximately million and million of interest related to the cmc lease portfolio during and  respectively

interest expense 
total interest expense for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the  decline is primarily due to the basis point reduction in the average cost of funds  offset in part by the impact of a  increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
for the year ended december   there was  of interest expense on deposits including checking  money market and certificates of deposits as compared to  for the  net decrease in interest expense on deposits was the result of a basis point decline in the average rate paid on deposits resulting in a positive  rate variance  partially offset by a negative volume variance of  due to an increase in the average interest bearing deposit balance of  for the year ended december   interest expense on other borrowed funds including short term debt  fhlb advances  subordinated debt and convertible subordinated debt was  compared to  for the  decline in interest expense related to other borrowed funds is the result of a basis point decline in the average cost of funds  partially offset by the impact of a  increase in the average outstanding balance 
the basis point reduction in the average cost of other borrowed funds was primarily due to fixed rate term fhlb advances being prepaid and replaced with variable rate advances  repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit 
netbank also reduced its overall cost of funds during the period by reallocating its sources of funds to rely more heavily on deposits with an average cost of basis points as opposed to other borrowed funds with an average cost of basis points 
net interest income 
net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the provision for credit losses was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the figure contained million of provision specifically for the cmc lease portfolio 
see part i 
item legal proceedings included in this report for a more in depth discussion of the cmc litigation 
the increase in provision expense  excluding the million cmc provision in  is primarily related to the million increase in loan and lease receivables during the period 
reference is made to the heading financial condition asset quality and non performing assets above for additional detail concerning the determination of provision expense related to maintaining the proper level of allowance for credit losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for of this increase  gain on sales of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights accounted for  this large increase was primarily attributable to the strong performance in the financial intermediary segment and resource s mortgage subsidiaries not being included in the first three months of the mortgage subsidiaries improved results were attributable to a generally lower interest rate environment resulting in higher production and more favorable pricing conditions 
service charges and fees increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  in of this increase   is attributable to the addition of resource s mortgage servicing operation 
the company realized  of gains on sales of investment securities available for sale as certain investment securities were sold during  compared to  during realized gains during of  were offset in part by impairment charges of on two variable  long term corporate bonds 
the bonds had traded under book value for an extended period of time due to widening credit spreads 
both bonds carry a standard poor s a rating 
other income was  for the year ended december   compared to  for of this increase   was attributable to the inclusion of resource s operations for only a partial year during other income consisted of  of gains associated with fair value adjustments on derivatives hedging netbank s servicing portfolio   of revenues from mg reinsurance   of revenues from republic leasing   of management fees and  of ancillary fees and income 
non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all operating expenses such as salaries and benefits  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
non interest expense increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for resource s non interest expenses during the first quarter of were approximately  however  since resource was not acquired until march   its non interest expenses for the first quarter of are not included in the non interest expense total 
the  of non interest expense for included  of acquisition and severance costs and  of other costs associated with integrating resource s operations during additionally  during  the company incurred  of prepayment fees on the early extinguishments of certain fixed rate fhlb advances  compared to  of prepayment fees during excluding these items  non interest expense increased  for the year ended december   compared to the majority of the increase  on a comparable basis  is due to the  increase in impairment and amortization of mortgage servicing rights and the  increase in salaries and wages 
the high level of refinance activity during  associated with the low interest rate environment  drove the increase in amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
the increase in salaries and wages was primarily driven by the billion  on a comparable basis  increase in production during compared to additionally  professional fees increased  on a comparable basis  due primarily to the million of legal expenses associated with the cmc litigation 
these increases were partially offset by declines in loan servicing expenses of  which should continue to decline as netbank replaces externally serviced loans with internally originated and serviced loans  and customer service expenses of  related to the consolidation of back office processes and lower cash item losses due to more aggressive fraud prevention efforts 
retail banking segment 
the table below provides an overview of the results of operations for the retail banking segment change net interest income provision for credit losses net interest income after provision gain on sale of loans fees  charges and other income total revenues total expenses pre tax loss before gains on securities  debt and net servicing results net loss on securities and prepaid debt net servicing results pre tax loss average earning assets average upb underlying msrs operations to average earning assets net interest income provision net interest income after provision fees  charges and other income banking revenues total expenses pre tax income before net gains on securities  debt and net servicing results net servicing results to upb underlying msrs net interest income increased  during  or basis points  compared to this increase is primarily due to a decline in the cost of funds during compared with and the inclusion of premium impairment charges of approximately million in the decline in the cost of funds was achieved through increased deposits  its lowest rate source of funds  and prepaying million of fixed rate fhlb advances  its highest cost source of funds 
provision for credit losses declined by  primarily due to million of provision specifically for the cmc lease portfolio recorded during see item legal proceedings included in this report for a more in depth discussion of the cmc litigation 
adjusted for the million and for netbank business financing  which was only included in nine months of  provision expense increased by  due to the retention of billion of internally originated mortgage loans  auto loans and leases during service charges and fees declined  during compared to  primarily due to tighter underwriting guidelines curtailing overdrawn deposit fees 
the decline in fee income is somewhat offset by a decline in cash item losses  which is included in total expenses 
despite a increase in deposits  the retail bank managed to reduce its total expenses by  total expenses in include a full year of republic leasing compared to only nine months during  a difference of  total expenses for included  of charges associated with the acquisition and integration of resource 
excluding the period over period changes  total expenses declined primarily due to a decrease of  in external loan servicing fees and a decline of  in customer service expenses  which includes cash item losses 
these declines were offset in part by increases of  in salaries and benefits   in data processing and  in professional fees 
the retail banking segment s earnings were lower than expected due to the  of prepayment fees on fhlb advances and the retail bank lending a large portion of its funds to the financial intermediary segment to support its record billion of production 
the retail banking segment finances the mortgage operations in the financial intermediary segment at warehouse rates  which are generally lower than what the retail banking segment would earn by directly investing in longer term assets 
financial intermediary segment

for the year ended december   the financial intermediary segment had record pre tax income of  compared to  for the  increase was driven primarily by increases of billion in production and billion in sales due the addition of resource s mortgage operations on march   which would only be included in nine of the twelve months during the period  coupled with an increase of basis points in the pre tax margin due to industry pipelines approaching capacity during the first nine months of causing pricing pressures to ease 
transaction processing segment 
the following table highlights the results of operations for the transaction processing segment change total revenue total expenses pre tax loss during and  the transaction processing segment primarily consisted of the servicing division 
nps  the atm and merchant processing division  was not purchased until december  and therefore its results of operations are only included from that date forward 
the improved pre tax loss of  during compared to was primarily related to the increase in loans serviced by the transaction processing segment on behalf of the retail bank and financial intermediary segments 
the increase in loans serviced enabled the servicing division to take advantage of greater economies of scale 
other elimination segment 
for the year ended december   the other elimination segment recorded a pre tax loss of  compared to a pre tax loss of  for the same period of this amount represents netbank s holding company expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses 
the elimination of intersegment revenues primarily consist of the deferral of gains associated with the sale of loans to the retail banking segment from the financial intermediary segment and loan servicing fees paid by the retail banking and financial intermediary segments to the transaction processing segment 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
netbank s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of its operating  investing  and financing activities 
netbank s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  sales of loans  sales or maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan payments and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
netbank can use cash generated through the retail deposit market  its traditional funding source  to offset the cash utilized in investing activities 
netbank s available for sale securities and short term interest earning assets can also be used to provide liquidity for lending and other operational requirements 
net cash inflow for was  compared to a net cash outflow of  for the increase in net cash flow for was primarily due to sales of loans held for sale outpacing originations by million 
this cash inflow was offset  in part  by originations of loan and lease receivables of billion outpacing sales  repayments and maturities of billion  and purchases of investment securities of million outpacing sales  repayments and maturities of million 
as an additional source of funds  netbank had available under existing lines of credit agreements billion at december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details of the available lines of credit 
the company uses deposits as its principal source of funds 
during compared to  deposits increased by million to billion from billion as of december  netbank s deposit products include checking  money market and certificates of deposit accounts 
deposit account terms vary  with the principal differences being the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
netbank is competitive in the types of accounts  services and ranges of interest rates offered on deposit products 
although market demand generally dictates which deposit maturities and rates will be accepted by the public  netbank intends to continue to promote checking  money market and certificates of deposit to the extent possible consistent with asset and liability management goals 
there is the risk that a dramatic increase in interest rates could cause netbank s maturing certificates of deposits to be disintermediated  and therefore  netbank would be unable or unwilling to replace those certificates of deposit at the then higher interest rates 
the increase in deposits was offset by a decrease in other borrowed funds  which include fhlb advances  repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit of million during capital resources 
netbank and netbank  fsb are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure of either company to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on netbank s consolidated financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  netbank  fsb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of netbank  fsb s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
netbank  fsb s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
under current regulatory guidelines  netbank  fsb may not make a capital distribution to the company without prior approval of the ots 
current guidelines require  among other things  that netbank  fsb not make an unapproved capital distribution in excess of its current period year to date undistributed earnings plus the preceding two years undistributed earnings and in no event make a distribution which would cause netbank  fsb to be less than adequately capitalized as defined below 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require netbank  fsb to maintain minimum amounts and ratios as set forth in the following table 
netbank  fsb s regulatory agency  the office of thrift supervision ots  requires netbank  fsb to maintain minimum ratios of tangible capital to tangible assets of  core capital to tangible assets of and total capital to risk weighted assets of 
as of december  netbank was subject to a side letter agreement with the ots  which required netbank  since its acquisition of resource in  to maintain minimum capital held against forward sold conforming mortgages to be the greater of or  and in no event allow the total capital to total assets to fall below and netbank  fsb to maintain core capital and total risk based capital ratios 
while netbank  fsb was not in compliance with the terms of the side letter agreement on december   it expired on january   and therefore  netbank and netbank  fsb are no longer subject to its more restrictive terms 
the company is not aware of any negative consequences associated with the expired side letter agreement 
the following table presents information related to netbank  fsb along with capital requirements mandated by the ots actual for capital adequacy purposes to be categorized as well capitalized under prompt corrective action plan amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio december  total capital to risk weighted assets core capital to adjusted total assets tangible capital to adjusted total assets n a n a tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a december  total capital to risk weighted assets core capital to adjusted total assets tangible capital to adjusted total assets n a n a tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a in addition  netbank s subsidiaries engaged in mortgage banking must adhere to various hud regulatory guidelines including required minimum net worth to maintain their fha approved lending status 
failure to comply with the hud guidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification 
as of december   market street and meritage were in compliance with hud guidelines 
netbank and its subsidiaries are subject to various other capital requirements by secondary market investors and states 
none of these capital requirements are more stringent than the ots capital requirements 
failure to comply with these restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
other than the side letter deficiency as previously described  all of the capital requirements placed upon netbank and its subsidiaries were met as of december  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk netbank s principal businesses are retail banking and the origination and purchase of mortgage loans 
these businesses are funded by customer deposits and  to the extent necessary  other borrowed funds 
consequently  a significant portion of netbank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and fluctuations in interest rates will affect netbank s future net interest income and cash flows 
this interest rate risk is netbank s primary market risk exposure 
for the year ended december   the only derivative financial instruments that netbank entered into were associated with hedging activities related to i the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale  ii the pipeline of mortgage loan purchase commitments for which the interest rate has been locked  iii hedging the securitization and sale of portfolio loans  iv the owned mortgage servicing rights portfolio and v the mortgage servicing rights which netbank intends to retain associated with the pipeline of mortgage loan purchase commitments for which the interest rate has already been locked 
netbank s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by netbank s management

fair values of financial assets and liabilities are estimated using several methods 
the first method is by use of directly observable market prices 
this method applies to most of the loans held for sale and investment securities available for sale which trade in highly liquid markets 
a second method employs the use of market benchmarks 
in this method  a benchmark financial asset or liability is selected which matches many of the characteristics of the financial instrument being evaluated 
the instrument being evaluated is then priced at a spread relative to the benchmark instrument 
this method applies to many loan and lease receivables 
a third method used to estimate the fair value of an instrument employs approximating a spread over a readily available market index or yield curve 
this method is used where no directly observable market exists and no suitable benchmark instrument can be found 
many deposit accounts are evaluated in this manner 
based on these fair value estimates  the data indicates that the net value of assets and liabilities exceeds that of their associated carry value 
most of this excess value is derived from the origination of interest bearing deposits 
additionally  the table shows the exposure of the portfolio to theoretical instantaneous and parallel changes in market interest rates of and basis points 
these simulated values are created using complex financial models which incorporate many assumptions 
prudent balance sheet management dictates that changes in value for one instrument should be offset to some extent by another balance sheet instrument 
for example  the largest single component of market exposure is loan and lease receivables 
this category declines in theoretical value by million for a basis point increase in rates 
this exposure is mitigated by the duration of interest bearing deposits having offsetting exposure of million  and interest bearing certificates of deposit with offsetting exposure of million 
while most of the risk is balanced out in this manner  the data suggests that the company benefits in a decline in market interest rates  versus a rise in interest rates 
this is commonly referred to as a liability sensitive position 
management carefully manages the exposure to these scenario simulations and many others  which are intended to be broadly representative of the likely future path of interest rates 
in examining the table presented above  one point that is worth consideration  as a simplifying assumption  this analysis assumes that risk exposure is passively rather than actively managed  in other words  management does not attempt to alter the balance sheet position to changing market levels 
in practice  management closely monitors market exposure levels and actively manages the position 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the valuation of netbank s market and interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
one of the ways netbank  fsb  like other savings banks  measures interest rate risk is based on a net portfolio value npv analysis 
npv equals the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
an npv ratio is determined by dividing npv by the present value of assets 
the following table sets forth the estimated netbank  fsb npv ratios as of december  and december  assuming rate shocks of to basis points limits and current npv ratios for netbank  fsb rate shock in basis points as of december  as of december  minimum as of december  flat minimum ratios for npv risk are established by the board of directors as prudent levels for the respective interest rate scenarios 
lower npv ratios denote more market rate sensitivity for a given rate scenario 
as of december  the analysis indicates sensitivity to rising market interest rates 
this is consistent with the fair value analysis presented above and incorporates many of the same assumptions used in the fair value analysis 
this sensitivity is  however  well within the board approved limits for these scenarios 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical rate changes is based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay 
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates
