the company has recorded regulatory liabilities totaling million  including million for accrued asset removal cost and million for self insurance at december  if the company were required to terminate application of sfas no

valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in note n to the financial statements  chesapeake has completed its responsibilities related to one environmental site and is currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of three other former gas manufacturing plant sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts because the environmental protection agency epa or state authority may not have selected the final remediation methods 
additionally  there is uncertainty due to the outcome of legal remedies sought from other potentially responsible parties

page operating revenues revenues for the natural gas distribution operations of the company are based on rates approved by the public service commissions of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the natural gas transmission operation s revenues are based on rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
however  the regulatory authorities have granted the company s regulated natural gas distribution operations the ability to negotiate rates with customers that have competitive alternatives using approved methodologies 
in addition  the natural gas transmission operation can negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved tariff rates 
chesapeake s natural gas distribution operations in delaware and maryland each have a gas cost recovery mechanism that provides for the adjustment of rates charged to customers as gas costs fluctuate 
these amounts are collected or refunded through adjustments to rates in subsequent periods 
the company charges flexible rates to the natural gas distribution s industrial interruptible customers to make them competitive with alternative types of fuel 
based on pricing  these customers can choose natural gas or alternative types of supply 
neither the company nor the interruptible customer is contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas 
the propane wholesale marketing operation records trading activity net  on a mark to market basis  for open contracts 
the natural gas segment recognizes revenue on an accrual basis 
the propane distribution  advanced information services and other segments record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  chesapeake no longer amortizes goodwill 
instead  goodwill is tested for impairment 
the initial test was performed upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   and again at the end of  and these tests were based on subjective measurements  including discounted cash flows of expected future operating results and market valuations of similar businesses 
those tests indicated that the goodwill associated with the water business was impaired and charges totaling million pre tax were recorded in at december  and  no goodwill remained related to the water companies 
the propane unit had  in goodwill at both december  and testing has not indicated that any impairment is necessary 
goodwill is tested annually and when events change 
results of operations the company s net income from continuing operations was million  or per share diluted  for  a decline of  compared to net income from continuing operations of million  or per share diluted  for the decrease principally reflects a decline in operating income caused by warmer temperatures on the delmarva peninsula and cost increases associated with documenting and auditing internal control and compliance efforts in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley 
page net income from continuing operations for was million compared to million for net income for was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million in  or per share diluted 
during  chesapeake decided to exit the water services business and had sold the assets of six of seven dealerships by december  the remaining operation was sold in the results of water services were classified as discontinued operations for all periods 
discontinued operations experienced losses of  and per share diluted for  and  respectively 
chesapeake adopted sfas no

chesapeake s results reflected strong customer growth  warmer weather as compared to  customers energy conservation and costs incurred to comply with sarbanes oxley 
weather  measured in heating degree days  was percent warmer than management estimates that warmer weather negatively impacted gross margin by  the natural gas segment was able to offset the impact of warmer weather through customer growth of percent 
additionally  the company incurred approximately  of expenses through december  related to compliance with section of sarbanes oxley 
these costs include incremental audit fees  expansion of the internal audit department and the temporary hiring of an outside consultant 
the increase in operating income from the company s natural gas operations was more than offset by decreases in the propane and advanced information services businesses 
improvement in chesapeake s overall results compared to was primarily related to strong customer growth and colder weather  which led to increased contributions from the company s natural gas and propane operations 
the delmarva natural gas operations experienced an increase of percent in residential customers 
weather  measured in heating degree days  was percent colder than the propane wholesale marketing operation and the advanced information services segment also improved operating income compared to operating income summary in thousands increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease business segment natural gas distribution transmission propane advanced information services other eliminations total operating income the following discussions of segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased gas cost for natural gas and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be page considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
chesapeake believes that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated operations and under its competitive pricing structure for non regulated segments 
chesapeake s management uses gross margin in measuring its business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
natural gas distribution and transmission the natural gas distribution and transmission segment earned operating income of million for  million for  and million for  resulting in an increase of  for and an increase of million for natural gas distribution and transmission in thousands increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease revenue cost of gas gross margin operations maintenance depreciation amortization other taxes other operating expenses total operating income natural gas heating degree day hdd and customer analysis increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease heating degree days delmarva actual year average average number of residential customers delmarva florida total estimated gross margin per hdd per delmarva residential customer added estimated gross margin estimated other operating expenses compared to revenue and cost of gas increased in compared to  primarily due to changes in natural gas commodity prices and customer growth 
commodity cost changes are passed on to the ratepayers through a gas cost recovery or purchased gas cost adjustment in all jurisdictions  therefore  they have limited impact on the company s profitability 
however  higher commodity prices may cause customers to reduce their energy consumption through conservation efforts and may cause the company to have higher bad debt expense 
gross margin grew by million in compared to the company estimates that warmer weather reduced gross margin by  after adjusting for the effect of weather  gross margin would have increased percent 
the company estimates that residential and commercial growth for the distribution operations generated million of gross margin increase 
the company added  residential customers  an increase of percent  in this page growth was net of lower consumption per customer  that reflects customer conservation efforts in light of higher energy costs and a higher mix of apartments rather than single family homes in the customer additions for some divisions 
additionally  the natural gas supply and management services operation increased gross margin by  primarily through industrial customer growth and resale of seasonal excess capacity on upstream pipelines 
the natural gas transmission operation also achieved gross margin growth of  due to additional transportation services provided to its firm customers 
higher other operating expenses partially offset the gross margin increase 
included in the expenses were  related to sarbanes oxley section compliance implementation 
excluding the sarbanes oxley costs  expenses would have increased million  or percent 
the higher other operating expenses reflect the costs to support customer growth 
compared to revenue and cost of gas increased in compared to  primarily due to changes in natural gas commodity prices 
revenue and cost of gas were also affected by the unbundling of services that took effect in for all non residential customers of the florida division and in november for residential customers 
as a result  all florida customers have switched from sales service  where they purchased both the commodity and transportation service from the company  to purchasing transportation service only 
therefore  there are no longer revenues or costs associated with the commodities 
gross margin for the delaware and maryland distribution divisions increased million in over temperatures in were percent colder than the prior year 
the company estimates that the colder weather in generated an additional  of gross margin compared to additionally  the increase of  residential customers  or percent  contributed an estimated  to gross margin 
the growth also required an estimated additional cost of  for operations and maintenance expenses 
also contributing to the increased gross margin were rate increases in delaware that became effective in december and volumetric increases for existing customers 
gross margin for the florida distribution operations increased million  due to the implementation of transportation services for residential customers and customer additions 
residential customer growth reached percent in florida  an increase of customers 
agreements with two new industrial customers also helped increase gross margin 
gross margin for the transmission operation increased by  in compared to an increase in interruptible transportation gross margin and volume added through a system expansion completed in november were partially offset by a rate reduction that became effective december the rate agreement is more fully discussed in the section below captioned regulatory activities 
the natural gas gross margin increases in were partially offset by higher operating expenses  primarily operations and maintenance expenses and other taxes that relate to the increased volumes and earnings as well as pension and employee costs 
page propane during  the propane segment experienced a decrease of million in operating income compared to  reflecting a gross margin decrease of million  partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of  during  the propane segment experienced an increase in operating income of million  or percent  over in addition  gross margin increased million  partially offset by an increase of  in operating expenses 
propane in thousands increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease revenue cost of sales gross margin operations maintenance depreciation amortization other taxes other operating expenses total operating income propane heating degree day hdd analysis increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease heating degree days delmarva actual year average estimated gross margin per hdd compared to increases in revenues and cost of sales in were caused by an increase in the commodity prices of propane  partially offset by lower sales volumes due to warmer weather 
commodity price changes are generally passed on to the customer  subject to competitive market conditions 
high commodity prices may cause customers to reduce their energy consumption through conservation efforts and may cause higher bad debt expense 
propane distribution gross margin declined million and propane wholesale marketing gross margin fell by  the company estimates that warmer weather negatively impacted gross margin by  after adjusting for the impact of weather  gross margin decreased percent 
lower retail gross margin per gallon in the distribution business reduced gross margin by approximately  in addition  lower sales volumes  not attributable to the weather  reduced gross margin by approximately  including  related to customers in the poultry industry 
the closing of a poultry processing plant in the fourth quarter of is estimated to have reduced gross margin by  the plant is not expected to reopen 
an outbreak of avian influenza on the delmarva peninsula in the first quarter of also contributed to the lower sales volumes 
the influenza outbreak was contained 
volumes were also down partially due to customers conserving energy in light of higher energy costs 
finally  gross margin earned from a non recurring service project in contributed  to the decline in gross margin

delaware 
on september   the delaware division filed its annual gas sales service rates gsr application that was effective for service rendered on and after november  with the delaware public service commission delaware psc 
on september   the delaware psc approved the gsr charges  subject to full evidentiary hearings and a final decision 
due to the most recent rise in natural gas market prices  the delaware page division s under collection balance was expected to exceed the six percent tolerance as defined in its tariff  therefore  on december   the delaware division filed an out of cycle rate application with the delaware psc proposing to place revised gsr charges into effect on january   pending approval by the delaware psc 
on december   the delaware psc granted approval of these supplemental gsr charges  subject to full evidentiary hearings and a final decision

on december   the maryland public service commission maryland psc held an evidentiary hearing to determine the reasonableness of the maryland division s four quarterly gas cost recovery filings during the twelve months ended september  on january   the hearing examiner issued proposed findings approving the quarterly gas cost recovery rates as filed by the maryland division  permitting complete recovery of its purchased gas costs for the period under review 
since no parties involved in the case appealed or provided written exceptions to the proposed findings  the findings became a final order of the maryland psc on february florida 
on march   the florida division filed tariff revisions with the florida public service commission florida psc to complete the natural gas commodity and transportation unbundling process by requiring all customers  including residential  to migrate to transportation service and authorize the florida division to exit the commodity merchant function 
transportation services were already available to all non residential customers 
on november   the florida psc approved the company s request for the first phase of the unbundling process as a pilot program for a minimum two year period 
the company has implemented the program 
as a part of this pilot program  the company submitted several filings during to address transition costs  the disposition of the over recovered gas cost balances  the implementation of the operational balancing account and the level of base rates 
the florida psc approved the transition cost resolution on january  the florida psc also approved the refunding of the remaining balance of  in the over recovered purchased gas cost account 
the refund was made in march additionally  the florida psc approved the activation of the operational balancing account on january  on july   the florida psc approved a rate restructuring proposed by chesapeake 
the restructuring created three new low volume rate classes  with customer charge levels that are designed to ensure that all customers receive benefits from the unbundling 
on august   the florida division filed a petition with the florida psc for authorization to restructure rates and establish new customer classifications 
the filing is revenue neutral  but would allow the florida division to collect a greater percentage of revenues from fixed charges  rather than variable charges based upon consumption

at that time  the ferc deferred review of the filing pending settlement of a related matter concerning another transmission company 
page chesapeake understands that the other matter has now been resolved and eastern shore intends to resubmit its transition cost recovery filing during on december   eastern shore filed revised tariff sheets to implement revisions to its fuel retention and cash out provisions 
the proposed tariff revisions permit eastern shore to incorporate its deferred gas required for operations amounts into the calculation of its annual fuel retention percentage adjustment and to implement a surcharge  effective july of each year  to recover cash out amounts 
the ferc accepted eastern shore s revised tariff sheets and they became effective on january   subject to certain revisions to clarify the tariff sheets 
on january   eastern shore submitted the revised tariff sheets 
on april   eastern shore filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity application before the ferc requesting authorization to construct the necessary facilities to enable eastern shore to provide additional daily firm transportation capacity of  dekatherms over a three year period commencing november  on october   the ferc issued an order granting eastern shore the authority to construct and operate certain pipeline and measurement facilities in its service territories as requested 
phases i and ii were completed in and with new phase ii service levels beginning november  phase iii is planned for construction during on december   eastern shore filed to amend the application  seeking ferc authorization to construct and operate new pipeline facilities necessary to provide an additional  dekatherms of daily firm transportation needs identified and requested by its customers to be available november  this amended filing is currently pending before the ferc 
eastern shore has requested the ferc to expedite its decision making process in order to construct the proposed new facilities on a timely basis 
at december   the company had recorded  in construction work in progress related to this project 
while the company cannot predict the final outcome of this pending amended application  the ferc has typically granted approval to construct and operate new pipeline facilities to serve its customers in a timely fashion 
eastern shore  on february   filed with the ferc a plan and schedule for standards of conduct compliance as directed by the ferc s order no 
 issued on november  such standards of conduct govern the relationship between transmission providers such as eastern shore and their energy affiliates 
order no 
revises and conforms the current gas and electric standards by broadening the definition of an energy affiliate covered by such standards of conduct  and applies them uniformly to natural gas pipeline and electric transmission providers 
further  the standards are designed to assure that transmission providers cannot extend their market power over transmission to other energy markets by giving their energy affiliates unduly preferential treatment 
the standards also help ensure transmission providers offer service to all customers on a non discriminatory basis 
the deadline for compliance with the standards of conduct was september  eastern shore performed the necessary training required by ferc and completed the posting of required information as described in order no 
eastern shore is also following the ferc s recent rulemaking pertaining to creditworthiness standards for customers of interstate natural gas pipelines 
ferc has not yet issued its final rules in this proceeding 
upon such issuance  eastern shore will evaluate its currently effective tariff creditworthiness provisions to determine whether any actions will need to be taken to conform to the ferc s final rules 
environmental matters the company has completed its responsibilities related to the dover gas light site and continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental impact and explore corrective action at three other environmental sites see note n to the consolidated financial statements

the company s propane distribution business is exposed to market risk as a result of propane storage activities and entering into fixed price contracts for supply 
the company can store up to approximately four million gallons of propane including leased storage and rail cars during the winter season to meet its customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations  the company has adopted a risk management policy that allows the propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges of its inventory 
at december   the propane distribution operation had entered into a put contract to protect the value of million gallons of propane inventory from a drop in fair value 
the put contract expires in january the propane wholesale marketing operation is a party to natural gas liquids ngl forward contracts  primarily propane contracts  with various third parties 
these contracts require that the propane wholesale marketing operation purchase or sell ngl at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of ngl to the company or the counter party or booking out the transaction booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy 
the propane wholesale marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the new york mercantile exchange

and are not marked to market 
competition the company s natural gas operations compete with other forms of energy including electricity  oil and propane 
the principal competitive factors are price  and to a lesser extent  accessibility 
the company s natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that have the capacity to use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements 
lower levels in interruptible sales occur when oil prices are lower relative to the price of natural gas 
oil prices  as well as the prices of electricity and other fuels  are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  the company uses flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales side of its business to maximize sales volumes 
as a result of the transmission business conversion to open access and the florida division s restructuring of its services  their businesses have shifted from providing competitive sales service to providing transportation and contract storage services 
page the company s natural gas distribution operations located in delaware  maryland and florida offer transportation services to certain commercial and industrial customers 
in  the florida operation extended transportation service to residential customers 
with transportation service now available on the company s distribution systems  the company is competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
as it relates to transportation services  the company s competitors include the interstate transmission company if the distribution customer is located close enough to the transmission company s pipeline to make a connection economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass the distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  the distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
the company expects to continue to expand the availability of transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
the company established a natural gas sales and supply operation in florida in to compete for customers eligible for transportation services 
the company also provides sales service in delaware 
the company s propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their service territories  primarily on the basis of service and price  emphasizing reliability of service and responsiveness 
competition is generally from local outlets of national distribution companies and local businesses  because distributors located in close proximity to customers incur lower costs of providing service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent btu value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas serviced by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
the advanced information services business faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does the company 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly  which could adversely impact the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price 
inflation inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
fluctuations in natural gas prices are passed on to customers through the gas cost recovery mechanism in the company s tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from regulatory commissions for regulated operations while monitoring the returns of its unregulated business operations 
to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  chesapeake adjusts its propane selling prices to the extent allowed by the market
