the company has changed its presentation of cash flows generated from the non proprietary credit card accounts from operating to investing activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows  as the loans generated were predominately related to activities external to the company s sales of merchandise and services

as of january   the remaining million of senior debentures due is classified as long term debt 

table of contents the company s board of directors approved additional million authorizations to the company s existing share repurchase program on february  and july  as of january   the share repurchase program had approximately million of authorization remaining 
in connection with the proposed acquisition of the may department stores company  the company has suspended repurchases under the company s share repurchase program 
the company was party to a day credit agreement  pursuant to which certain financial institutions had provided the company with a million revolving loan facility which expired june  based upon an assessment of the company s liquidity needs  this agreement was not renewed 
however  the company s related billion five year credit agreement  which expires june   remains effective 
the company finances its proprietary credit card receivables  which arise solely from sales originated in the conduct of the company s retail operations  using on balance sheet financing arrangements  including term receivables backed certificates issued by a consolidated subsidiary of the company together with receivables backed commercial paper issued by another consolidated subsidiary of the company 
at january   these arrangements included a million asset backed commercial paper program 
under the million commercial paper program  a consolidated special purpose subsidiary of the company issues commercial paper backed by a class a variable funding certificate issued out of the prime credit card master trust which holds the proprietary receivables 
if the subsidiary is unable to issue commercial paper to fund maturities of outstanding commercial paper  it has the ability to borrow under a liquidity facility with a number of banks in order to repay the commercial paper 
the commercial paper investors have no recourse back to the company 
as of january   and january   there were no such commercial paper or liquidity borrowings outstanding 
the company finances its non proprietary credit card receivables  which arise from transactions originated by merchants that accept third party credit cards issued by the company s fds bank subsidiary  using on balance sheet financing arrangements 
under these arrangements  a consolidated special purpose subsidiary of the company sells class a and class b variable funding certificates  issued out of the prime credit card master trust ii trust ii  which holds the non proprietary receivables  to three unrelated bank commercial paper conduit programs 
during  the aggregate size of the commercial paper conduit programs used to finance the company s non proprietary credit card receivables was increased from million to million 
as of january   there were million of receivables backed borrowings outstanding under these arrangements  which were classified as short term debt 
in and  there was an increase in the company s non proprietary credit card portfolio due to greater penetration of the company s customer base 
prior to july  the company financed its non proprietary credit card receivables through an off balance sheet sale arrangement 
during july  in connection with the extension of the financing arrangement related to the company s non proprietary credit card receivables  the company s special purpose subsidiary took certain actions which resulted in the consolidation of trust ii for financial reporting purposes 
in particular  the documentation governing the arrangement was amended to provide the company s special purpose subsidiary the ability to unilaterally remove transferred assets from trust ii 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  this amendment disqualified the arrangement for sale treatment and required secured borrowing treatment for all sales of the company s non proprietary credit card receivables pursuant to this arrangement 
the principal assets and liabilities of trust ii consist of non proprietary credit card receivables transferred by the company to trust ii in transactions previously accounted for as sales under sfas no 
and the related debt issued by trust ii 
as a result of the company s actions  the transfer of receivables and debt are being treated as secured borrowings as of and subsequent to july  all assets and liabilities of trust ii were consolidated at fair value 
these actions increased the company s consolidated assets and debt by million at july  the company is a party to a five year  million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in june at january   the company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility  but had million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
the issuance of commercial paper under the company s  million unsecured commercial paper facility program will have the effect  while such commercial paper is outstanding  of reducing the company s borrowing capacity under the company s  million bank credit agreements by an amount equal to the face amount of such commercial paper 
there were no borrowings under the commercial paper program in or as of january  the company s bank credit agreement requires the company to maintain a specified interest coverage ratio of no less than and a specified leverage ratio of no more than 
the interest coverage ratio for was and at january  the leverage ratio was 
management believes that the likelihood of the company defaulting on them in the future is remote 
table of contents absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
however  if the company s results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the company is not in compliance with any of its debt covenants and the company is unable to obtain a waiver  much of the company s debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately 
at january   the company had contractual obligations within the scope of item a of regulation s k as follows obligations due  by period less than more than total year years years years millions short term debt long term debt interest on debt capital lease obligations other long term liabilities operating leases letters of credit other obligations other obligations in the foregoing table consist primarily of significant merchandise purchase obligations and obligations under outsourcing arrangements  construction contracts  employment contracts  group medical dental life insurance programs and energy and other supply agreements identified by the company 
the company s merchandise purchase obligations fluctuate on a seasonal basis  typically being higher in the summer and early fall and being lower in the late winter and early spring 
the company purchases a substantial portion of its merchandise inventories and other goods and services otherwise than through binding contracts 
consequently  the amounts shown as other obligations in the foregoing table do not reflect the total amounts that the company would need to spend on goods and services in order to operate its businesses in the ordinary course 
excluding the financing requirements necessary to effect the merger  as well as to fund the combined company s operations  management believes that  with respect to the company s current operations  cash on hand and funds from operations  together with its credit facilities and other capital resources  will be sufficient to cover the company s reasonably foreseeable working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements in both the near term and over the longer term 
the company s ability to generate funds from operations may be affected by numerous factors  including general economic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and demand  however  the company expects to be able to manage its working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts so as to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
for short term liquidity  the company also relies on its  million unsecured commercial paper facility  its million asset backed commercial paper program relating to the company s proprietary credit card receivables and three asset backed bank conduit commercial paper programs relating to the company s non proprietary credit card receivables in an aggregate amount of million all of which are discussed above 
access to the unsecured commercial paper program is primarily dependent on the company s credit rating  a downgrade in its short term rating could hinder its ability to access this market 
if the company is unable to access the unsecured commercial paper market  it has the ability to access  million pursuant to its bank credit agreement  subject to compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratio requirements discussed above and other requirements under the agreements 
the asset backed commercial paper programs are used to finance the company s proprietary and non proprietary credit card receivables 
these programs are extended annually and can be used to finance the receivables as long as the net portfolio yields remain positive and the company remains in compliance with other requirements under these agreements 
depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors  the company will from time to time consider the issuance of debt both unsecured and asset backed or other securities  or other possible capital markets transactions  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
management believes the department store business and other retail businesses will continue to consolidate 
the company intends from time to time to consider additional acquisitions of  and investments in  department stores and other complementary assets and companies 
acquisition transactions  including the proposed acquisition of the may department stores company  are expected to be financed from one or more of the following sources cash on hand  cash from operations  
table of contents proceeds from possible transactions involving our credit card related operations  borrowings under existing or new credit facilities and the issuance of long term debt  commercial paper or other securities  including common stock 
critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its proprietary and non proprietary accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including analysis of historical trends  aging of accounts receivable  write off experience and expectations of future performance 
proprietary and non proprietary accounts receivable are considered delinquent if more than one scheduled minimum payment is missed 
delinquent proprietary accounts are generally written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
delinquent non proprietary accounts are generally written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
the company reserves for doubtful proprietary accounts based on a loss to collections rate and doubtful non proprietary accounts based on a roll reserve rate 
at january   a percentage point change in the result of the loss to collections rate would impact the proprietary reserve for doubtful accounts by million 
at january   a percentage point change in the result of the roll reserve rate would impact the non proprietary reserve for doubtful accounts by million 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  and is stated at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded

 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period 
such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  the company has loss prevention programs and policies that are intended to minimize shrinkage 
physical inventories are generally taken within each merchandise department twice annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
long lived asset impairment and restructuring charges the carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed by the company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
for long lived assets held for use  a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations 
when a potential impairment has occurred  an impairment write down is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long lived assets 
if estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future  the company may be required to record asset impairment write downs 

table of contents for long lived assets held for disposal by sale  an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value less costs to sell 
such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale 
for long lived assets to be abandoned  the company considers the asset to be disposed of when it ceases to be used 
if the company commits to a plan to abandon a long lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life  depreciation estimates are revised accordingly 
in addition  liabilities arise such as severance  contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision 
the amounts the company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for workers compensation and public liability claims up to certain maximum liability amounts 
although the amounts accrued are actuarially determined based on analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amounts the company will ultimately disburse could differ from such accrued amounts

at january   the company had unrecognized actuarial losses of million for the pension plan and million for the serp 
these losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years in accordance with sfas no 
the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience may differ significantly from current expectations 
the company believes that the most critical assumptions relate to the long term rate of return on plan assets in the case of the pension plan  the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefit obligations and the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels 
the company has assumed that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of for and the company develops its long term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from several professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and long term asset class return expectations  as well as long term inflation assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on the pension plan assets decreases 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the pension plan assets by from to would increase the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
the company discounted its future pension obligations using a rate of at december   compared to at december  the company determines the appropriate discount rate with reference to the current yield earned on an index of investment grade long term bonds and the impact of a yield curve analysis to account for the difference in duration between the long term bonds and the pension plan s and serp s estimated payments 
pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by from to 
table of contents increased the projected benefit obligation at january  by approximately million and increased estimated pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels was as of december  and as of december  for the pension plan  and as of december  and as of december  for the serp 
the company develops its increase of future compensation level assumption based on recent experience 
pension liability and future pension expense both increase or decrease as the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels is increased or decreased  respectively 
changing the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels by would change the projected benefit obligation at january  by approximately million and change estimated pension expense by approximately million
