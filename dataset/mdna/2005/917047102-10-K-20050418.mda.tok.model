item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly results for additional information 
item properties our united states based home offices are located in philadelphia  pennsylvania and occupy approximately  square feet at walnut street  immediately adjacent to our anthropologie store at walnut street  and approximately  square feet at south th street 
our direct to consumer offices and order processing call center are also located in philadelphia and occupy approximately  square feet at sansom street 
we also operate additional direct to consumer offices at walnut street in philadelphia which occupy approximately  square feet 
our home office in the united kingdom re located during fiscal to market place in london and occupies approximately  square feet of space 
our home offices and call center facilities are leased properties with varying lease term expirations through  with the exception of our building at south th street which we own 
we own a  square foot distribution center in lancaster county  pennsylvania 
in april  we executed an operating lease for an additional  square foot distribution center located in edgefield county  south carolina 
we also utilize a distribution facility in reno  nevada operated by a third party 
for more information on our distribution center properties  see item business company operations distribution 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
however  we plan to identify and utilize additional space over the next several years to accommodate our growth demands 
in april  we acquired several buildings in the historic core of the philadelphia navy yard  approximately five miles from our existing philadelphia based home offices 
this acquisition will allow for the efficient consolidation of our multiple philadelphia based offices on one campus and should support our growth needs for at least the next ten years 
the buildings are located at s 
broad street  admiral peary way  s 
th street  s 
th street and kitty hawk avenue  which contains three buildings 
five of the buildings were purchased at a nominal price and two will be considered for long term capital leases 
upon completion of certain improvements  the campus will provide office space of approximately  square feet 
options on several adjacent buildings are also available for at least the next ten years to allow for additional expansion if necessary 
we expect to begin moving certain of our offices during the third quarter of fiscal and expect to complete the move of all offices no later than the end of fiscal we don t believe there will be a material financial impact to earnings associated with vacating our current headquarters 
we expect to expend between and million to improve the property  net of potential incentive credits  over the next three years  most of which will be capitalized and depreciated based on the useful life of the improvements and fixtures

the company believes the claim is without merit and intends to defend it vigorously 
the company is party to various other legal proceedings arising from normal business activities 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

overview we operate two business segments  a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business 
our retailing segment consists of our urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people stores 
in addition  urban outfitters and anthropologie offer merchandise through our direct to consumer operations  which consist of a catalog and web site for each of these brands 
free people offers merchandise through a web site 
our wholesale segment consists of our free people wholesale division 
a store is included in comparable store net sales data  as presented in this discussion  when it has been open at least one year  unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not operating at its full capacity within that year 
a store is considered non comparable when  in general  the store had no comparable prior year sales 
non store sales  such as catalog and internet sales  are also considered non comparable 
although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores  we believe that  based only on our observations  the increases in our key sales metrics  as discussed in our results of operations  correlate to an increase in customer traffic 
we believe this may be caused by a combination of positive response to our brands fashion offerings  our web advertising  additional circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base  including expansion into enclosed malls and specialty retail centers 
any significant change in the business risk factors  some of which are discussed below  may affect our sales and may have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  our fiscal ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
our business segments are sensitive to economic conditions  consumer spending  fashion shifts  industry trends and demographic conditions 
we are subject to seasonal variations and face numerous business risk factors 
consumer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products  which include our products  may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there is a risk that consumer sentiment may turn negative due to economic and or geo political factors which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of the date of this report  we have not identified any known trends in the economy  industry or demography that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents our business is dependent upon our ability to predict fashion trends  customer preferences and other fashion related factors 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly 
our success depends in part on management s ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
if we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines  our sales will be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory 
in response  we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
compared to our retail segments  our wholesale business is more sensitive to changes in fashion trends because of longer lead times in the design and manufacture of its apparel 
while we do not plan for mistakes in our fashion offering selections  our fashion decisions constitute a material risk and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we plan to grow our store base by approximately per year 
we may not be successful in expanding our business and opening new retail stores 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to open and operate new retail stores on a profitable basis 
our operating complexity and management responsibilities will increase as our store base grows  and we may face challenges in managing our future growth 
such growth will require that we continue to expand and improve our operations  including our distribution and business support infrastructures  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
in addition  we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified personnel to work in our new stores or to successfully integrate the stores into our business 
our expansion prospects also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  among other things competition  the availability of financing for capital expenditures and working capital requirements  the availability of suitable sites for new store locations on acceptable lease terms  and the availability of inventory 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals 
even if we succeed in opening new stores as planned  we cannot assure you that our newly opened stores will achieve revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us  or at all 
if our stores fail to achieve  or are unable to sustain  acceptable revenue and profitability levels  we may incur significant costs associated with closing those stores 
retail stores as of january   we operated urban outfitters stores of which were located in the united states  two in canada  three in england  one in scotland and one in ireland urban retail 
during fiscal  we opened new urban outfitters stores  all of which are located within the united states except for one store which we opened in london 
urban outfitters targets young adults aged to through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment 
our product offering includes women s and men s fashion apparel  footwear and accessories  as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts 
we plan to open many additional stores over the next several years  some of which may be outside the united states 
urban retail s north american and european store sales accounted for approximately and of consolidated net sales  respectively  in fiscal we operated anthropologie stores as of january   all of which were located in the united states 
during fiscal  we opened new anthropologie stores 
anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged to our product assortment includes women s casual apparel and accessories  home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items 
we plan to open many additional stores over the next several years 
anthropologie s store sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in fiscal 
table of contents we operated two free people stores as of january   both of which are located in the united states 
free people primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged to free people provides a unique merchandise mix of casual women s apparel  accessories and gifts 
we plan to open additional stores over the next several fiscal years 
free people s sales accounted for less than of consolidated net sales in fiscal all brands combined  we plan to open approximately to stores during fiscal  including two to three new free people stores 
the remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between urban retail and anthropologie 
our goal thereafter is to increase net sales at least per year through a combination of opening new stores  growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations 
direct to consumer in march  anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise  most of which is also available in our anthropologie stores 
during fiscal  we circulated over million catalogs and believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the anthropologie brand identity with our target customers 
we plan to expand circulation to approximately million catalogs during fiscal and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years 
anthropologie operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
anthropologie 
com  debuted in december the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel  accessories  household and gift merchandise 
as with our catalog  we believe that the web site increases anthropologie s reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of anthropologie s store operations 
in march  urban outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our urban outfitters stores 
in fiscal  we circulated approximately million urban outfitters catalogs  which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness 
we plan to expand circulation to at least million catalogs in fiscal urban outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
urbanoutfitters 
com  was launched in may the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the store 
as with the urban outfitters catalog  we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers as well as helps to support the strength of urban outfitters store operations 
we successfully launched the free people web site during september of fiscal the web site  www 
freepeople 
com  offers consumers the entire free people product assortment 
initial customer reaction to our web site has exceeded our initial plan  and we intend to make strategic investments to market the direct to consumer channel of free people by expanding the web site and merchandise assortment and potentially testing a catalog during fiscal direct to consumer sales were approximately of consolidated net sales in fiscal wholesale the free people wholesale division designs  develops and markets young women s contemporary casual apparel 
our range of tops  bottoms  sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately  better department and specialty stores  including bloomingdale s  marshall fields  macy s west  nordstrom  urban outfitters and our own free people stores 
free people wholesale sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in fiscal 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales  net of estimated customer returns 
payment for merchandise at our stores  and through our direct to consumer business  is by cash  check  credit card  debit card or gift card 
therefore  our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges 
deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
these custom orders  typically for upholstered furniture  have not been material 
gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption 
sales return reserve we record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported  but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit 
the reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends 
if the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate  additional sales returns would be recorded in the future 
as of january  and  reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total liabilities 
inventories we value our inventories  which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories  such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory  are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria we utilize to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise  the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle  and merchandise currently priced below original cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if required 
inventories as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 

table of contents we rely heavily on our ability to identify changes in fashion 
our inability to reasonably determine these changes may lead to higher seasonal inventory levels and a future need to increase markdowns to liquidate our inventory 
we take measures to mitigate this risk  including designing goods in house in conjunction with buying our goods from the open market 
we use our catalogs to help predict the fashion appropriateness of seasonal merchandise in our stores 
our reserves related to adjusting the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on recent historical trends 
our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis 
we expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly  related inventories 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements  as well as furniture and fixtures  and are included in the property and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report 
store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements 
the typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years 
furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over five years 
net property and equipment as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type eg  mall versus free standing  store location eg  urban area versus college campus or suburb  current marketplace awareness of the urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which  in general  is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
for fiscal  and  we had no write downs of long lived assets 
we have only closed two stores in our history  which in both cases took place at the expiration of the lease term 
we have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period 
as of the date of this report  all of our stores opened in excess of three years are generating positive cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on tax legislation currently in effect 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase the transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our income tax expense  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
deferred tax assets as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing 
table of contents and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery is at risk  we must establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
we have valuation allowances of million as of january  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards 
in the future  if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions or to realize off setting capital gains becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates and assesses if we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances if necessary 
accounting for contingencies from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
results of operations as a percentage of net sales the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period 
this table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows fiscal year ended january  net sales cost of sales  including certain buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income other income other expenses income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period change net sales gross profit income from operations net income 
table of contents operating leases we lease our retail stores under operating leases 
many of the lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions or some combination of these items 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the accounting lease term 
in a february letter to the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec clarified its position regarding certain lease accounting practices 
the sec s letter specifically addressed the depreciable life of leasehold improvements  rent holidays and landlord tenant incentives 
based upon the sec s conclusions included in their letter  we reviewed our historical treatment of these lease issues to ensure our accounting treatment reflected the sec s conclusions 
historically  we had recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period commencing on the date the store opened 
the lease period did not include the construction period to make the lease space suitable for operations during which time we were not permitted to occupy the space for retail purposes 
we changed our straight line period to include this construction period in our calculation of rent expense over the lease term  which results in an accounting lease term that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
therefore  for purposes of calculating straight line rent expense  the commencement date of the lease term reflects the date we take possession of the building for initial construction and setup 
we had also historically classified tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of property and equipment 
the related amortization was classified as a reduction of depreciation expense on our consolidated statements of income 
our consolidated statements of cash flows historically reflected tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities 
we changed the classification of tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated financial statements to reflect such items as deferred rent that will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the straight line period 
furthermore  tenant improvement allowance activity is now presented as part of cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
after assessing our findings using the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recorded a cumulative adjustment of million  net of tax  which reduced net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased by to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase was primarily attributable to a million  or increase  in retail segment sales 
free people wholesale sales contributed million or  excluding sales to our retail segment  to the increase 
the growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal was driven by a million increase in non comparable and new store net sales  a million or increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of million or 
the increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a  and increase for anthropologie  free people and urban outfitters  respectively 
the increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal that are considered non comparable during fiscal comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales prices resulting from higher initial price points which more than offset a modest increase in markdowns 
comparable store sales continue to significantly exceed our plan thus far during fiscal direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation of approximately million additional catalogs  increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at both urban outfitters and anthropologie 
the increase in free people wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings 

table of contents gross profit in fiscal increased to of net sales or million from million or of net sales in fiscal improvements to initial margins due to better merchandise sourcing and the leveraging of store related occupancy costs  driven by the comparable store sales increases  accounted for the majority of this increase 
this combined increase more than offset the million  or of net sales  multi year cumulative charge to accelerate deferred rent for store locations resulting from our review of our historical method of accounting for certain operating leases 
total inventories at january  increased by to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores 
on a comparable store basis  inventories increased by versus the prior fiscal year 
we anticipate making similar investments in connection with new store openings in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal decreased to of net sales versus of net sales for fiscal this improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses

as of january   and  our net working capital was million  million and million for these years  respectively 
the change in net working capital is primarily due to the increase in our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and inventories that have increased in order to support our current growth 
during the last three years  we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations 
our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories

during fiscal  we plan to construct and open to new stores  renovate certain existing stores  increase our catalog circulation by million  to million catalogs  and purchase inventory for our stores and direct to consumer business at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth 
we plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal to approximately million  primarily to expand our store base  begin construction of our new home office campus and purchase equipment for our new distribution center in south carolina 
both our new store  catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year 
improvements to our new home office campus and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth 
we expect to spend between and million to improve our new home office campus  net of potential incentive credits  over the next three years  most of which will be capitalized based on the useful life of the improvements and fixtures 
the purchase of distribution center machinery  equipment and personal property will approximate million 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations  as well as available credit under our line of credit facility  are expected to fund our commitments and all such expansion related cash needs at least through fiscal on september   we renewed and amended our line of credit facility the line 
the line is a three year million revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit to million at our discretion  subject to a seven day request period

table of contents our investment portfolio includes certain auction rate securities that have been reclassified from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities in the january  consolidated balance sheet 
auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days 
auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at predetermined short term intervals  usually every  or days 
they trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer 
interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction 
although these securities are issued and rated as long term bonds  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset 
we had historically classified these instruments as cash equivalents if the period between interest rate resets was days or less  which was based on our ability to either liquidate our holdings or roll our investment over to the next reset period 
based upon our re evaluation of the maturity dates associated with the underlying bonds  we have reclassified our auction rate securities  previously classified as cash equivalents  as short term marketable securities in the january  consolidated balance sheet 
we have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations  as well as available credit under our line of credit facility  are expected to fund such obligations and commitments 
the tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of january  contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands description total obligations less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years operating leases purchase orders construction contracts capital lease total contractual obligations includes store operating leases  which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent 
the obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease 
additionally  there are ten locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table

sfas no 
r also requires that benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption

the company adopted the disclosure requirements in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and such disclosures are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly results while we have been profitable in each of our last operating quarters  our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from august to december of each year the back to school and holiday periods 
sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on our results of operations 
any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
while the comparable store sales trend thus far during fiscal continues to significantly exceed our plan  results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with  and sales contributed by  new stores  store expansions and the integration of new stores into our operations or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for our direct to consumer operations 
fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise  as well as other goods and services  the value of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar  and changes in interest rates 
our inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments  commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material 
we purchase substantially all of our merchandise in us dollars  including a portion of the goods for its stores located in canada and europe 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as of january   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated aa or better  auction rate securities rated aa or better and money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable  a change in interest rates earned on the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments
