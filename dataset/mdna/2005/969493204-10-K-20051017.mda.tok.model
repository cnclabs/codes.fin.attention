the year ended july  was very difficult for the company as it recorded an million loss 
while revenues decreased approximately  gross profit decreased over due to increased material costs in its manufacturing segment  operational inefficiencies related particularly to one major contract and increased workers compensation costs for prior year policy claims 
the delay in enacting a new infrastructure spending bill for the country limited the number of jobs the company s bridge girder operation was able to bid  contributing to the decline in the company s backlog of million

under the conventional insurance program  the company records accrued expense based on rates applicable to payroll classifications  which are fixed at the time of the policy issuance

the company is operating under a forbearance agreement with its major lender pursuant to which approximately million is scheduled to be repaid by march  in addition  the company is in default of nearly all of its other debts and leases by virtue of failing to make scheduled payments in a timely fashion 
because of the company s financial condition and poor market conditions in its areas of operation  there is a significant risk that the company may not be able to book additional work to maintain its level of operations 
the company operates in an industry where such problems are common  and where there are large risks related to estimating and performing work and collecting amounts earned 
it is likely that the company may continue to suffer operating losses and have difficulty meeting its obligations 
management is pursuing a number of contingency plans to address these issues and increase the chances that the company will survive

should other financing options not materialize  the company has identified certain assets that could be available for sale  including ten heavy lift cranes  with an estimated market value of million  which may generate net proceeds of approximately  the company is reviewing its land  especially in manassas  virginia to identify its highest and best use 
management feels that if the property was to be sold  enough cash might be generated to pay off debt and allow the company to relocate  if necessary 
these assets have not been segregated from other assets and are currently being used in operations 
while the company feels that operations will provide cash flows in fiscal  conditions in the areas in which it works could create risks where the company would have difficulty estimating and performing work  and collecting amounts earned 
the factors discussed previously have raised substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern
