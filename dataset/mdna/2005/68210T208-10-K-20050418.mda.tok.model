this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained herein 
recent developments on january   we filed suit in united states district court  western district of louisiana the b litigation against the holders of our subordinated convertible debentures and other third parties collectively  the debenture holders 
the suit alleges violations by the debenture holders pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of we believe the debenture holders acted together for the purpose of illegally acquiring  holding  voting or disposing our equity securities during relevant time periods and have exerted an adverse group influence on omni and our equity securities 
the suit seeks the disgorgement of profits realized by the debenture holders from their purchases and sales of our common stock 
on february   one of the debenture holders  portside growth and opportunity fund portside notified us of certain alleged events of default under the subordinated convertible debentures issued to portside the portside debentures 
as a result of these alleged events of default  portside demanded that we redeem all of the portside debentures held by it  in the aggregate principal amount of  on march  as of april   we have not redeemed any of the portside debentures 
portside also notified us of its intention to commence a civil action against us to obtain a judgment with respect to all amounts owed to it under the portside debentures 
portside s acceleration of the maturity of the debentures and its potential commencement and prosecution of a civil action against us to obtain a judgment with respect to all amounts owed to it under the debentures are subject to the terms of certain subordination and intercreditor agreements the subordination agreements between the debenture holders and webster business credit corporation the agent 
pursuant to the subordination agreements  portside is not authorized to receive payments in respect to the debentures as a result of the acceleration of the maturity of the debentures or enforce any such judgment without the prior written consent of agent  except upon the earliest to occur of  among other things  i acceleration of the senior debt  ii commencement of enforcement of any rights and remedies under the senior debt documents or applicable law with respect to the senior debt or the senior debt documents  iii the institution of any proceeding as defined in the subordination agreements  or iv the passage of days from the date on which agent received written notice of the default from portside 
to our knowledge  the threatened civil action has not commenced 
should portside  in fact  commence the threatened civil action  we intend to vigorously defend the litigation and pursue all available remedies including those available pursuant to the aforementioned b litigation filed against the debenture holders 
restatement of financial statements due to the lock box arrangement and the subjective acceleration clause of the line agreement  the balance sheet as of december  has been restated to classify the line of credit as required by eitf  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
accordingly  the previously filed form k a  for the year ended december  should not be relied upon 
furthermore  we have restated our previously issued unaudited financial statements for the two interim periods ended june  and september  to correct an error that arose as a result of the incorrect calculation of the valuation of certain warrants and the beneficial conversion features originally recorded on certain convertible debentures entered into during april this error resulted in an understatement in the amount recorded as convertible debentures  net of discounts and an overstatement in the amount recorded as additional paid in capital of million 
furthermore  the amount of these debt discounts  the beneficial conversion features and loss on extinguishments of debt charged to expense were overstated 
in addition  we have restated our previously issued unaudited financial statements for the first two interim periods of to correctly classify our line of credit as a long term liability 
all applicable amounts relating to these restatements have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in note to the consolidated financials statements in this form k 
due to restatements of the consolidated financial statements previously filed with the forms q for the quarterly periods ended march   june   and september  such financial statements contained in these form q should no longer be relied upon 
general demand for our services 
we receive our revenues from customers in the energy industry 
demand for our services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data and oil and gas companies operating primarily in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
the level of activity for our services is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data and the exploration for oil and gas  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor  as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
during  with the reduction in the price of oil and gas  we began to experience a decrease in demand for our services which continued through but  in  the oil and gas industry experienced a rebound and has remained strong since then 
increased capital expenditure budgets by oil and gas companies generally result in increased demand for our services 
for the years ended december   and  our operating revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
seasonality and weather risks 
our operations are subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours 
since our activities take place outdoors  on average  fewer hours are worked per day and fewer holes are generally drilled or surveyed per day in winter months than in summer months due to an increase in rainy  foggy  and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours

as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  million in aviation revenue is included in the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  and million for drilling revenues decreased slightly from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to permitting and weather related delays 
operating revenues are expected to increase in  as the demand for  and range of  our services continue to improve and because we will include a full year of operations for trussco

also  million of the increase related to amortization of deferred loan costs and million related to the amortization of debt discounts originally recorded in conjunction with the convertible debentures in early we expect to manage our senior debt facility as we explore strategic business opportunities 
we recorded a million accounting loss in connection with the inducement for early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible debentures during there was no such charge in other expense income decreased from income of million to expense of million 
this increase in expense was due to costs incurred as a result of financing transactions that did not close and the loss on the disposal of two aircraft 
in  we reversed million of the net operating loss carry forwards previously reserved 
there were no taxes recorded in due to the significant net operating loss incurred 
during  the entire amount of the net operating loss carryforward generated was fully reserved as it was determined that more likely than not this increase in deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future

going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the company has suffered a significant loss from operations during the current year  has a working capital deficit  is currently in default on certain of its debt instruments  and will require capital funding from sources other than operations to meet its current debt obligations 
in the past two years  the company has been required to raise additional capital by the issuance of both equity and debt instruments 
there are no commitments from funding sources  debt or equity  in the event that cash flows are not sufficient to fund ongoing operations or other cash commitments as they come due 
these factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management will be required to raise additional capital in the near term through offerings of equity or debt securities to fund the company s debt service obligations and its operations 
no assurance can be given that such financing will be available or  if available  that it will be on commercially favorable terms 
moreover  available financing may be dilutive to current investors 
the company is in the process of securing capital from prospective investors  that if successful  in conjunction with cash flows from operations and sales of certain non core assets  will be used to fund its current debt service obligations and serve to mitigate the factors that have raised doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful account may be required 
due to the nature of our industry  we may periodically have concentration of credit risks 
as a result  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be significant 
we have made significant investments in inventory to service our equipment 
on a routine basis  we use judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products primarily influence our estimates 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we have established reserves to reduce our net deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations change  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
in making this determination  we have considered future income in assessing the ultimate recoverability of the recognized net deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  we obtain indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and  to a limited extent  self funded insurance programs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we currently do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about the future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments at december  all instruments described are non traded instruments and approximated fair value 
dollars in thousands long term debt fixed rate      average interest rate variable rate  average interest rate short term debt fixed rate  average interest rate variable rate  average interest rate interest rate exposure our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the debt on our consolidated financial statements with fixed interest rates totals at december   of our consolidated long term debt was subject to variable interest rates 
the detrimental effect of a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be to increase net loss before provision for income taxes by approximately million for the year ended december  foreign currency risks we transact of our business in us dollars  thus we are not subject to foreign currency exchange risks
