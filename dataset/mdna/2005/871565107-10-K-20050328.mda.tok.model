item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under d ifferent assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of the customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note i to the consolidated financial statements  the company has accrued  in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  will satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note i 
as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and remedy of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
subject to the difficulty in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that the likelihood of material losses in excess of the amounts recorded is remote 
however  any changes  including regulatory changes  may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
as noted in notes c and q to the consolidated financial statements  the company has recorded asset impairment charges under sfas in each of the last three years including a  charge in as part of the loss recognized for discontinued operations 
based on assessments performed on the continuing assets of the company  which indicated no write downs were deemed necessary  the company believes that it is unlikely that these types of impairment charges will continue to occur 
however  if business conditions at any of the plant sites were to deteriorate to an extent where cash flows and other impairment measurements indicate values for the related long lived assets are less than the carrying values of those assets  additional impairment charges may be necessary 
in the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements no 
 inventory costs and no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  both having an effective date in june of the company does not believe either statement will have an impact on the company s financial statements

the increase in working capital and use of cash flows from continuing operations came primarily from increases in inventories and accounts receivable of  and  respectively  offset by an increase of  in accounts payable and net income from continuing operations of  before depreciation and amortization expense of  the increases in inventories came from the metals segment due primarily to raw material cost increases and to a lesser extent  increased units discussed in the metals segment comparisons below 
the accounts receivable increases w ere generated from increased sales activity experienced in december of as compared to the same period in the cash flows provided by discontinued operations were derived from declines in accounts receivable and inventories coupled with an increase in accounts payable totaling   and  respectively 
the cash flows were generated from the sale of the company s liquid dye business in the first quarter of and the planned reduction of the remaining dye business assets in anticipation of selling off this business as discussed in the discontinued operations discussion below

the increase for the quarter resulted from percent higher average selling prices offset by percent lower unit volumes 
surcharges paid on stainless steel raw materials increased throughout the year increasing from an average of about 
per pound in december to an average of about 
per pound in december the segment was able to pass through most of these cost increases  which accounted for most of the increase in selling prices  and benefited throughout from selling price increases implemented to offset the continued increases in surcharges included in raw material costs 
because of the steadily increasing raw material and selling prices experienced throughout the year  the segment generated higher profits from selling l ower cost inventories  which contributed to the significant gross profit improvement experienced for the year and fourth quarter compared to the same periods last year 
the most noteworthy accomplishment in the segment s pipe business in was a percent increase in special alloy sales which rose to percent of pipe sales 
this is the highest level ever achieved and is the result of the segment s focus on developing more non commodity pipe business where profit margins are higher 
although the piping systems business had a loss for the year  after experiencing three consecutive quarters of losses in  piping systems generated an operating profit for the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter was the first one in where customers scheduling requirements allowed piping systems to get a sufficient amount of work into the shop to enable the operation to operate profitably for the quarter 
piping systems backlog ended the year at  all of which should be completed in  compared to a  backlog at the end of selling and administrative expense increased  or percent compared to  but remained at seven percent of sales 
the increase in dollars came primarily from increases in profit based incentives  sales commissions from increased sales  and bad debt expense 
the company increased page its reserves for bad debts to offset exposure from the higher level of accounts receivable consistent with the increase in sales activity experienced through comparison of to metals segment dollar sales increased percent in compared to the increase for the year resulted from percent higher average selling prices partially offset by six percent lower unit volumes 
surcharges paid on stainless steel raw materials increased throughout the year increasing from an average of about 
per pound in december to an average of about 
per pound in december the segment was able to pass through most of these cost increases  which accounted for most of the increase in selling prices  especially in the fourth quarter 
the increase in the year to date selling price also resulted from a change in product mix to a higher percentage of higher margin large diameter pipe  experienced primarily in the second and third quarters of the combination of higher selling prices and favorable product mix along with cost reductions implemented in the third quarter of contributed to the significant gross profit improvement experienced for the year c ompared to the same period of while commodity pipe generated operating income for the year  piping systems did not fare as well  incurring losses for the year consistent with piping systems backlog maintained a better than average level throughout the year  ending the year at  however  due to the customers scheduling requirements for our material  we were unable to get a sufficient amount of work into the shop to enable piping systems to operate profitably through the first nine months 
the situation improved in the fourth quarter  and piping systems was able to generate a modest profit for the quarter 
selling and administrative expense for decreased  compared to  or nine percent  and declined slightly as a percentage of sales as a result of cost reductions implemented in september of  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items  many of which impacted selling and administrative expense

favorable market conditions for most of the segments products and new product development at the spartanburg location accounted for the increase in sales 
the percent increase in gross profits in compared to resulted from improved profitability at all three of the chemical plants  and from a  inventory charge in at the greensboro plant discussed below 
unlike  the segment was able to pass some of the higher operating costs  especially energy costs  to its customers which allowed the segment to generate additional margin contribution from the increased sales volume 
for the fourth quarter of  sales were up  or percent and gross profits increased  or percent compared to fourth quarter operating income was  compared to a loss of   in the fourth quarter of the modest level of profitability in the fourth quarter was caused primarily by poor results at the spartanburg plant because of the low level of contract campaigns 
this location often has volatility in its production levels quarter to quarter because of the customers scheduling requirements 
included in operating income in the fourth quarter of were the  inventory charge and a  impairment loss discussed below 
management is pleased with the dramatic improvement achieved without any benefit from a new product that was the object of much of the segment s effort in selling and administrative expense declined  in compared to  and declined as a percent of sales to ten percent in compared to percent in the decline came primarily from reduced bad debt expense at op caused by the need to increase bad debt reserves in to account for several customer bankruptcies 
comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales were up a modest two percent and gross profits declined ten percent for compared to profitability in both years was negatively impacted from the recording of long lived asset impairment write downs of  in  discussed in the following paragraph  and  in on assets located at the spartanburg location 
gross profits in were also hurt by an inventory adjustment discussed below 
the segment was unable to pass higher operating costs  especially energy costs  to its customers 
as a result  the segment experienced only a one percent increase in gross profits for the year compared to  adjusted for the  inventory write down 
the segment has been able to expand production at its spartanburg location by adding new products  which provides a better opportunity for the location to more evenly absorb manufacturing cost and avoid significant negative manufacturing variances this location has historically experienced 
this allowed th e location to operate profitably for the year 
however  the location continues to have significant swings in profitability from the timing of its contract tolling campaigns as it incurred losses in the first and fourth quarters of  while generating profits in the second and third quarters of the segment s pigment business located in greensboro  north carolina  experienced a significant downturn in textile business during the last six months of incurring losses during that period 
although the non textile portion of the pigment business is growing  it is not expanding fast enough to offset the declining textile business 
the reduced volume did not produce sufficient contribution margin to offset operating costs causing the losses 
as a result of lost business  mainly from customers closing their operations  the location accumulated excessive inventories with few or no customers available to systematically sell off and or blend off the inventory 
as a result  a  inventory charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of also during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an impairment assessment on the plant and equipment located at greensboro and based on the results of the assessment  recorded a  impairment loss 
see note c to the consolidated financial statem ents 
page selling and administrative expense increased  in compared to  selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in compared to percent in the increase came primarily from increases in sales commissions from higher sales and bad debt expense at op caused by the need to increase bad debt reserves in to account for several customer bankruptcies  coupled with  of non recurring miscellaneous income received in from warehouse rentals at one of the locations

discontinued operations on july  the company purchased certain assets of rite industries 
these assets along with synalloy s existing textile dye business were placed in a newly formed subsidiary of the company called blackman uhler  llc bu colors 
the newly formed company is owned percent by the company with the remaining percentage owned by a group of former rite industries executives 
the acquisition provided a new customer base in the paper and other non textile industries 
total cost of the acquisition was  and the company funded the acquisition with available cash 
as a result of the continuing downward trends in the textile industry and poor financial performance of the textile dye business  the company decided at the end of the fourth quarter of to divest the liquid dye portion of its dye business servicing the textile industry  and began downsizing the remaining dye business 
in the fourth quarter of  a  inventory charge was recorded to cost of goods sold to write down inventor ies related to the liquid dye product lines 
on march   the company entered into an agreement to sell the liquid dye business comprised of vat  sulfur  liquid disperse and liquid reactive dyes with annual sales of approximately  for approximately its net book value  and several customers and related products of the remaining textile dye business were rationalized 
business conditions in the remaining dye business were poor throughout  especially in the first six months  as bu colors experienced operating losses in every quarter of in the third quarter of  the company decided to attempt to sell the remaining dye business and on december   entered into an agreement to sell the dye business  closing the sale on january  the terms included the sale of the inventory of bu colors along with certain equipment and other property associated with the business being sold  and the licensing of certain intellectual property  for a purchase price of approximately  of which  was paid at closing  and the balance of  will be payable over time based on the operations of the purchaser 
in december of  the company completed an impairment assessment on the plant and equipment located at the spartanburg facility related to the bu colors operations 
as a result  the company recognized an impairment loss of  from the write down of plant and equipment 
as a result of the sale of the dye business  the company has discontinued the operations of bu colors and has presented the financial information of bu colors as discontinued operations  including restating and unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note r to the consolidated financial statements for the schedule that includes these items 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense increased  or percent  to  for compared to the increase resulted primarily from the addition of environmental expenses of  to accrue for  of environmental remediation costs in the fourth quarter of at the spartanburg facility and from the recording of a  environmental charge in the second quarter of to reflect the settlement with the environmental protection agency of the company s obligation as a potentially responsible party in the clean up of a waste disposal site 
reference should be made to note i to the page consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in increased  from from increases in borrowings and the prime interest rate under the lines of credit with a lender

current conditions and outlook market conditions in the metals segment have improved over the past three months  from december through february  as sales activity  pricing and unit volumes for commodity pipe have increased from levels experienced over the last half of management remains optimistic about the current conditions that exist in the commodity pipe and specialty alloy markets 
the segment has been successful in penetrating new markets  such as projects in the lng industry  where management believes there is significant growth potential 
if piping systems can continue to generate sufficient volume through its operations  and demand for piping continues at it current level  management believes the metals segment will operate profitably in management is pleased with the dramatic improvement achieved by the specialty chemicals segment even without any benefit from a new product line that was the object of much of the segment s effort in the segment has introduced a new line of fire retardant chemicals 
applications for this new line of chemicals include mattresses  furniture and home appliances  which are subject to new fire retardant regulations that we believe will become effective in qualifications of our products continue to have good success in each of the applications 
in addition  our products offer a safer alternative to the use of certain compounds used in products currently servicing these industries 
regulations in california are now requiring mattress manufacturers to utilize fire retardant products that conform to the new regulations in their production process which began january  management was hopeful that federal regulations similar to regulations adopted by california would be in place in the first half of  but it now appears that it will be sometime in the first quarter of before the federal regulations will address the issue 
as a result of these delays  the segment was unable to generate significant production in however  management remains confident that demand for fire retardant products will ramp up in the second half of and grow into significant volumes 
management is encouraged by the performance of this segment and believes it is positioned to continue to grow from new product opportunities  which has been the hallmark of our specialty chemicals segment 
this segment s business tends to be impacted by general economic conditions  and assuming no significant downturn in the general economy  management expects this segment to operate profitably in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates
