item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included at item overview we are a leading global provider of technology products and services for the tracking and recovery of valuable mobile assets 
our proprietary technology  wireless network and unique integration with law enforcement agencies provide an effective means for tracking and recovery of stolen vehicles and construction equipment 
in the first quarter of  we expanded the use of our technology to motorcycles 
in october  we acquired boomerang  the dominant marketer and provider of stolen vehicle recovery technology in canada 
we have three separately managed and reported business segments domestic  international and boomerang 
domestic segment we develop and market the lojack system  a unique  patented system designed to assist law enforcement personnel in locating  tracking and recovering stolen vehicles 
we also offer lojack early warning as an option to the lojack system which provides early notification to a vehicle owner in the event an unauthorized user is operating the vehicle 
our revenues in the united states are derived primarily from the sale of lojack units  alarms and related products  lojack early warning and extended product and non recovery warranties to consumers 
approximately of domestic sales are made through a distribution network consisting of dealers of new and used automobiles 
we have strong consumer brand awareness in the united states and in many areas around the world 
we continue to expand our installation capacity and increase efficiencies by adopting alternative installation methods through contracting with certified dealers and other third parties to perform the installation of the lojack unit 
we monitor the quality of these alternative installations through the use of an expanded quality control process and we maintain full warranty service of lojack units  both for the convenience of dealers through which the lojack units are marketed and for our ability to maintain a high degree of quality control and security over our technology 
we also offer an extended warranty at the point of sale to new customers and through direct sales efforts to existing customers 
we record additions to deferred revenue for our lojack early warning product and certain warranty products for which we have been deemed to be the primary obligor of the underlying contract 
we receive full payment typically within days of the transaction  but recognition of the deferred revenue is spread over the estimated life of the product or service 
these payments are a significant component of our cash flow from operations 
additions of these components of deferred revenue were  for the year ended december   compared to additions of  for the same period a year ago 
international segment we derive an increasing percentage of our consolidated revenues from international licensees 
these revenues consist of product sales  royalties and license fees 
revenues from the international segment comprised approximately of consolidated revenues for the year ended december   up from in and in internationally  our licensed stolen vehicle recovery technology is operational in countries and territories around the world including argentina  brazil  colombia  costa rica  ecuador  france  germany  guatemala  hong kong  kenya  lesotho  mexico  the mozambique  nigeria  panama  poland  puerto rico  russia  south africa  spain  swaziland  trinidad and tobago  uganda  united kingdom and venezuela 
we record additions to deferred revenue for international license fees and recognize the revenue over the term of the license generally ten years 
royalty revenues are recognized when earned 

table of contents boomerang segment revenues from our boomerang segment are derived primarily from the sale of boomerang and boomerang units  related products  and service contracts 
approximately of revenues are derived from the sale of boomerang and boomerang units through auto accessory retailers and automobile dealers 
approximately of revenues are derived from service contracts 
more than insurance companies based in quebec and ontario offer rebates to customers who install a boomerang unit in their high priced or high risk of theft vehicles  and in many instances  require installation of a boomerang unit 
purchasers of boomerang units are required to also purchase a service contract 
the terms of service contracts offered range from to months and are payable in full upon activation of the related unit or renewal of a previous service contract 
as of december   there was approximately  of deferred revenue resulting from approximately  active service contracts 
recent developments and trends many companies in the vehicle security market have stated that they offer stolen vehicle recovery solutions and many automobile manufacturers are installing gps products at the factory 
these factors have not had a material adverse impact on our revenues  unit sales or penetration rates thus far 
the long term impacts of these trends are hard to predict  however  we are evaluating the effectiveness of additional complementary technology combining gps and or cellular based communications with our time tested rf based stolen vehicle recovery technology 
we are deriving an increasing percentage of our revenues from outside of the united states  increasing to excluding boomerang of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  from of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  and of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  we expect the trend of increasing revenues and profits generated by operations outside the united states as a percentage of consolidated results to continue in the percentage of domestic units installed by third parties increased significantly during the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier  decreasing average direct installation labor cost per unit due to productivity improvements and the shift of expenses from fixed to variable 
we expect that the percentage of business through third party installers and distributors may continue to increase during resulting in a continued positive impact on unit volumes and gross margin percentages 
key factors of our business key factors and areas of focus by our senior management across all segments include monitoring material trends of sales of the automotive industry with a focus on increasing penetration rates through our existing automobile dealer channel and markets  sharing the best practices among our international licensees and analyzing those practices which have been successful  the effectiveness of strategic relationships with distributors  insurance companies and original equipment manufacturers  and the success of different pricing models such as those that include recurring payments  continuing reductions to domestic and international manufactured product costs  continuing to transition from a fixed to variable domestic installation cost structure by increasing the percentage of lojack units installed by third parties  continuing to develop improved technology and products while utilizing a second supplier  and continuing to develop relationships with insurance companies to help drive demand  where applicable 
we evaluate our financial condition and operating performance based on the progress in achieving the key factors listed above 
boomerang acquisition on october   we completed our acquisition of boomerang tracking inc for consideration of approximately  including final acquisition and other costs of  primarily in the form of i  shares of lojack common stock  valued at approximately  ii  shares of exchangeable shares issued by our canadian subsidiary  exchangeco  which can be exchanged for  shares of lojack common stock  valued at approximately  and iii  in cash 
the acquisition extended our capabilities in stolen vehicle recovery technology to canada 
boomerang generated sales of approximately  during its fiscal year ended april   and  for the two months ended december 
table of contents the sources of the cash consideration used in the acquisition included approximately  of cash acquired from boomerang total cash acquired from boomerang as of the date of acquisition was approximately  with the remaining  financed with a term loan 
boomerang s operations  beginning from the date of acquisition  are reported within our results from operations as a separate segment 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 business combinations  or  sfas no 
 and we have accordingly allocated the purchase price of boomerang based upon the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we determined identifiable intangible assets to be valued at  these identifiable intangible assets included the fair value of trade names  trademarks  monitoring contractual relationships and completed technology 
the boomerang acquisition also resulted in goodwill of approximately  as of the acquisition date 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements include lojack and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation 
management is required  in certain instances  to use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the actual results could differ from those estimates 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the significant accounting policies and estimates  which we believe to be the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial position and results of operations  include revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
we earn revenues primarily from the domestic sale and installation of lojack units and lojack early warning  the sale of products and components to international licensees  the receipt of international license fees and royalties  the sale of extended and enhanced warranty programs  the sale of boomerang and boomerang units  related products  and service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue on domestic sales of lojack units  boomerang and boomerang units and related products  upon installation 
for sales to our third party sale and installation partners and distributors  revenue is recognized upon sale to the third party 
revenues relating to the sale of lojack early warning are recognized over the period of the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which management estimates is approximately five years 
as of december  and  we had deferred recognition of revenue of approximately  and  respectively related to this product 
if the estimated life of vehicle ownership proves to vary materially from the estimates we use  we would be required to change our estimates  which could result in material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period 
historically  there have not been any changes to our five year estimate 
revenues relating to the sale of service contracts by our boomerang segment are recognized over the life of the contract 
the term of service contracts offered ranges from to months and are payable in full upon activation of the related unit or renewal of a previous service contract 
revenues from international license fees are recognized ratably over the initial term of the license  typically ten years 
revenues from the sales of products and components of the lojack system to international licensees are recognized upon shipment to the licensee or  if later  when payment becomes reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized when earned or when payment becomes reasonably assured  whichever is later 
we make estimates of collectibility based upon historical experience  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
historically  there have not been material adjustments to recognized revenues based on these estimates 
as of december  and  we had deferred revenue recognition of approximately  and  respectively  in product shipments to international licensees because collection was not reasonably assured 
revenue on these shipments is recognized as payment becomes reasonably assured 
changes in the creditworthiness of these licensees could have a material effect on the timing and amounts of revenue recognized 
we sell several types of extended warranties 
for those warranties to which a third party  and not us  is the primary obligor  we recognize payments for these insurance contracts  net of related costs  in revenues at the time of sale 
revenues related to extended warranties  for which a third party is the primary obligor  aggregated approximately  and  for 
table of contents the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the laws of jurisdictions change so that we are determined to be the primary obligor  revenues may have to be deferred under such circumstances 
we believe that these jurisdictional changes are possible and should they occur  reported revenues could be adversely impacted 
for those warranties for which we are the primary obligor  revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated term of the warranties  determined to be equivalent to the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which is five years 
such revenues recognized from extended warranties previously deferred aggregated approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the estimated life of vehicle ownership varies significantly from the estimates we use  material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period could result 
incremental costs directly related to the provision of such warranties are deferred and charged to expense proportionately as the revenues are recognized 
any remaining warranty costs relating to actual claims made are recognized when incurred 
we believe the likelihood of material changes to the average estimated life of vehicle ownership is low 
accounts receivable 
domestic accounts receivable are due principally from automobile dealers that are geographically dispersed 
if the creditworthiness or the financial strength of the dealers were to decline  there could be an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
the terms under which we generally sell products and components of the lojack system to international licensees include cash prepayments  purchased private trade credit insurance or  most commonly  established payment terms 
should geopolitical situations change in the countries where our international licensees operate  there could be additional credit risks 
accounts receivable related to our boomerang segment consist of payments due from our automotive dealers and accessory retailers 
in the normal course of business  we monitor the financial condition of our customers 
our management does not believe that we have significant exposure to any individual customer 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts that corresponds to the creditworthiness of our customers  historical trends and economic circumstances 
changes to these estimates are possible and could result in a material effect on our balance sheet and reported results of operations 
product development 
costs for product development are expensed as incurred and include salaries  fees to consultants  and other related costs associated with the development of new products 
total product development expenses totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a portion of our product development efforts has been outsourced to third parties 
the contracts with third parties require payments based upon completion of defined milestones 
because the rate of achievement of these defined milestones is unpredictable  product development expenses may vary significantly from period to period 
such variability can have a significant impact on our income from operations and cash flows 
expenses related to milestone achievements  included in the above mentioned expenses  amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
valuation of cost investments 
periodically  we have made investments in our international licensees 
as of december   investments in international licensees  totaling  included a equity interest  with a carrying value of  in our mexican licensee and a equity interest  with a carrying value of  in our french licensee 
our investments in these licensees have resulted in ownership of less than of any one licensee and because we do not exercise significant control over the licensees  we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments made 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed 
based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows  market conditions  legal factors  market potential  operational performance  and in some cases  independent appraisals  we have concluded that there are no impairments to the fair value of these investments that should be viewed as other than temporary 
the international licensees in which we have made investments are in the early stages of operations and continue to develop their business models 
we may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period if a licensee requires additional capital and is unable to raise sufficient capital to continue operations  a licensee raises sufficient capital  but at a lower stock price than currently valued and or the operations and future cash flows of the licensee vary significantly from current projections  adversely affecting the viability of the business 
we have not recorded any gains or losses on these investments through december  while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in operating in these international markets could materially affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of these investments 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item valuation of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill 
as part of the october acquisition of boomerang  we recorded certain identifiable assets and goodwill see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
table of contents at item we will assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually  in the fourth quarter  in the case of goodwill 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and or goodwill might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
no such impairment charges have been recorded to date 
at december   there was  of intangible assets  of which  represented goodwill 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill could result in a material  non cash expense in the consolidated statement of income 
income taxes and deferred taxes 
we file income tax returns in canada as well as many states and localities within the united states 
we must estimate our income tax expense after considering  among other factors  differing tax rates between jurisdictions  allocation factors  tax credits  nondeductible items and changes in enacted tax rates 
a change in our effective income tax rate would have the effect of changing net income by approximately  or per share after tax 
deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting  known as temporary differences 
the tax effect of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets generally result in tax deductions or credits subsequent to the period in which the related item was recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
deferred tax liabilities typically reflect a current tax deduction for which the related item has not yet been recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets assumes that there will be sufficient future taxable income generated in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
financial derivative instruments and hedging 
we account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended 
sfas no 
requirements include the documentation of our hedging strategy and documentation that is required at the time we execute a hedge 
in january  we entered into four foreign currency hedge contracts  that mature over each of the four quarters in the period ended december   to hedge a portion of anticipated canadian dollar denominated sales against currency fluctuations 
the contracts have a notional value  totaling cad  and have maturity dates from march  through december  in january  we also entered into a interest rate cap agreement 
the primary objective for our use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of interest expense relating to our long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
we will record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we will reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to income 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with little need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein at item  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
recent pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based incentive compensation in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein for the pro forma net income and net income per share for the years ending december   and  presenting results if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas no 
r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas no 
r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 or eitf no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf no 
addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means 
eitf no 
states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock of a corporation  provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
the accounting provisions of eitf no 
are effective for reporting periods beginning after september  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf no 
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf no 
 however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  see note included in item herein 
we will evaluate the impact of eitf no

results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  in october  we acquired boomerang as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item the assets  liabilities and stockholders equity of boomerang are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and boomerang s results for the two months ended december  are included in the statement of income for the year ended december  the table below presents the boomerang results for the two months ended december  and the results for lojack for the years ended december  and in thousands 
in our opinion  the analysis of lojack s results for  excluding boomerang s results for the two month s ended december   as compared to  provides a meaningful analysis for purposes of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results for operations 

table of contents year ended december  consolidated two months ended december  boomerang tracking year ended december  lojack corporation year ended december  lojack corporation revenues cost of goods sold gross margin costs and expenses product development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating income other income expense interest income gain on short term investment interest expense other total income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues for the year ended december   domestic segment revenues increased by  or  as compared to the same period a year ago  primarily due to an increase in revenue of  or  primarily resulting from a increase in the number of lojack units sold during the period  partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per unit sold 
the decreased average revenue per unit sold reflects the increasing percentage of units sold through our third party installers and distributors as well as increased discounts and incentives earned by customers during units sold through third party installation partners yield lower per unit sales prices because the installation is performed by the third party  not us  an increase of  or  in revenue recognized from the sale of warranty products  and additional revenue of  or  relating to lojack early warning as the number of installed units continues to grow 
revenue for this product  which we launched nationally in the first quarter of  is initially deferred and then recognized over years  the estimated life of vehicle ownership  offset by  a decrease of  or  in alarm sales as our emphasis shifted from these products to warranty and lojack early warning products 
for the year ended december   international segment revenues increased by  or  as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to an increase in revenues of  or  resulting mainly from additional shipments of lojack units to our licensees in south africa and brazil  which continue to experience a significant increase in demand developed through their partnerships with insurance companies and other channel partners  increased royalty revenues of  or  from our licensees in argentina and france as the pricing structures for these licensees were modified in late to include recurring payments 
the number of units installed in the licensees customer base  which positively impacts the royalty calculation  continues to increase 
in addition  the increase also includes increased royalty revenues from the united kingdom  as certain royalty payments relating to previous quarters that were in dispute were collected in the second quarter of offset by  
table of contents a decrease of  in license fees resulting primarily from the termination of contracts with certain licensees and certain revenue recognized in in connection with the resolution of previously existing contingencies under the related licensee agreement  and a decrease of  or  in component sales to our licensees 
sales of infrastructure to licensees are typically high during their startup  in the first half of  our spanish licensee made considerable infrastructure purchases 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period a year ago 
domestic cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period a year ago  reflecting continuing initiatives to reduce the overall installed cost of the product  including various distribution and installation programs to more cost effectively sell and install lojack units by utilizing third parties 
while domestic unit sales increased by in as compared to the same period a year ago  total installation expense for the same period increased by only 
the distribution and installation programs contributed to the average direct installation labor cost per unit to decrease by 
we expect that the percentage of business conducted through third party installers and distributors will continue to increase during  and will result in a continued positive impact on reducing cost of goods sold 
international cost of goods sold for the year ended december  increased to of revenues  from of revenues for the same period a year ago 
this increase is largely due to the additional license fee revenue recorded in as discussed above which had no related cost of goods sold  a higher proportion of sales to licensees in to countries that generate greater volume  which typically results in lower margins  as well as a shift for certain licensees to a pricing model that yields lower margins for us on the initial shipment of the product  but yields a recurring stream of royalty revenue in the future 
product development product development expenses increased by  or  in as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increase was mainly attributed to the attainment of previously defined new product development milestones by our third party vendors and other development expenses resulting in an additional  in the increase also reflects additional personnel costs of  in  as we increased our engineering capability to support new products and infrastructure equipment 
we anticipate product development expenses in to be fairly consistent with the amounts incurred in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased  or  in as compared to the same period a year earlier primarily due to increased bonus and incentive compensation in of  as a result of our improved performance over the prior year 
in addition  total salary expense increased in over the prior year by  or  as compared to the same period in sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in to support our planned investment in personnel  advertising  and other marketing initiatives relating to the launch of new products and the entering of new domestic markets 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by  or  for  as compared to the same period a year earlier primarily due to increased compensation and other personnel related expenses of  which included increased incentive compensation in as a result of improved performance and an increase in administrative personnel costs necessary to support future growth  increased travel and consulting costs of  including costs related to obtaining required frequencies to operate the lojack system  and identifying partners to license our technology and products in new international markets including china and italy  
table of contents an increase of  relating to the outsourcing of certain administrative functions associated with processing certain incentive payments to our dealership network  and increased accounting and tax fees of  necessary to support compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and various tax planning initiatives 
other income expense other income  net  increased by  in  as compared to the same period a year earlier  primarily due to a gain of  resulting from the settlement of a foreign exchange contract entered into in august  which matured in october   to hedge our canadian dollar commitment to acquire boomerang 
interest income increased by  in as significantly higher cash balances were maintained during the year 
we do not anticipate gains and losses in related to foreign currency contracts to be as significant as those incurred in  however  in january  we began implementing a hedging strategy  which we anticipate continuing throughout  to hedge a portion of anticipated canadian dollar denominated sales against currency fluctuations relating to boomerang 
we anticipate interest expense will increase in future periods due to the  of long term debt outstanding at december  that was used to partially finance the boomerang transaction 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by  in  as compared to the same period a year ago 
the increase was a result of  in additional related taxable income in  as compared to the same period in our effective combined federal and state tax rate was for both periods 
net income and earnings per share as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by  to  in  from  in during  we experienced dilution in earnings per share due to increased weighted average diluted shares as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increases in weighted average diluted common shares outstanding reflects i new shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan  ii the exercise of existing stock options and iii a larger number of stock options being included in the dilution calculations because the market price of our common stock increased to a point where the stock options exercise prices were less than the average market price of the common stock 
in addition  in connection with our acquisition of boomerang   shares of our common shares and  exchangeable shares of exchangeco were issued in october year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenues revenues for the year ended december  increased by  or  as compared to the same period a year earlier 
for the year ended december   domestic revenue increased by  or  as compared to the same period a year earlier  primarily due to an increase of  or  in revenue resulting  in part  from a increase in the number of lojack units sold during the period and an increase in the average revenue per unit sold reflecting a price increase that was implemented in the fourth quarter of also  during the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize revenues relating to lojack units sold to third party installers upon shipment while establishing a related return allowance based on historical incidence of returns 
prior to the fourth quarter of  revenue on sales to the third party installers was deferred until the units were sold to the end customer because the related agreements with the installers contained a right of return 
this change resulted in the recognition of approximately  of revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of  which would have been deferred 
as of december    of revenue relating to this business was deferred  
table of contents an increase of  or  in revenue recognized from the sale of warranty products 
we sold contractual extended warranty products and recognized revenues ratably over the term of the contract 
we also sold a warranty product for which a third party  and not us  is the primary obligor on the contract at the time of sale 
in most jurisdictions  we recognize payments for these contracts  net of related costs  in revenues at the time of sale 
there were significantly more jurisdictions in which a third party was the primary obligor during the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier  additional revenue of  related to lojack early warning which was launched in the northeastern united states in the fourth quarter of and nationally in the first quarter of  and a decrease in revenue of  from other automobile security products as emphasis shifted from these products to the aforementioned warranty products and the lojack early warning product

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period a year earlier 
domestic cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period a year earlier  reflecting continuing initiatives to reduce the overall installed cost of the product  including various distribution and installation programs to more cost effectively sell and install lojack units by utilizing third parties 
international cost of goods sold for the year ended december  decreased to of revenues  from of revenues for the same period a year earlier 
this decrease was largely due to the additional license fee revenue recorded in as discussed above which had no related cost of goods sold 
this decrease was partially offset by a higher proportion of sales to licensees in to countries that generate greater volume  which typically results in lower margins  and a shift for certain licensees to a pricing model that yields lower margins to lojack on the initial shipment of the product  but yields a recurring stream of revenue in the future 
product development product development expense increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increase was mainly attributable to additional personnel costs and increased office rental expenses of  as we increased our engineering capability to support new products and infrastructure equipment  attainment of previously defined milestones by our third party vendor resulting in the expensing of  in  only  of similar expenses were incurred in   of expenses to establish local manufacturing of our products in brazil  and product development costs of  expensed in as the project related to these costs was abandoned

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier primarily due to increased compensation related expenses of  which included incentive compensation expense as a result of improved performance over the prior year  increased computer equipment rental expenses of  and increased travel expenses of  reduced legal fees of  as the fee arrangement with our lead outside counsel was renegotiated and fewer engagements were incurred with our international legal consultants  lower consulting fees of  due to the fact that professional fees incurred in the prior year relating primarily to the establishment of international markets and alternative domestic distribution partners which did not recur in  and reduced office related expenses of  as we continued to focus on cost control initiatives during other income expense other income  net increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier primarily because of reduced interest expense recorded in connection with capital leases of our installation vehicles 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increase was a result of  in additional related taxable income for as compared to our effective federal and state tax rate was for both periods 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources on october   we acquired boomerang  a provider of stolen vehicle recovery technology in canada  for consideration  including approximately  of acquisition and other costs  totaling approximately  consisting of  in cash   shares of lojack common stock valued at approximately  and exchangeco shares exchangeable for an additional  lojack common shares valued at approximately  a wholly owned canadian subsidiary of lojack  exchangeco  acquired all the issued and outstanding class a shares of boomerang pursuant to a combination agreement  dated as of august   between lojack  exchangeco and boomerang

the mulitcurrency credit agreement is comprised of a  revolving line of credit the line of credit and the term loan for borrowings of up to  advances under the term loan were available in a single canadian dollar denominated borrowing on the closing date of the boomerang acquisition october   at which time the unused portion of the term loan commitments expired 
the borrowings under the term loan used for the boomerang acquisition totaled cad  us dollar equivalent of  as of october  
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate  adjustable quarterly  at our option  at either the canadian base rate or a euro currency denominated rate

the euro currency denominated rate is defined as libor  as adjusted for a euro currency reserve percentage  plus an applicable margin the applicable margin totaling at december  
the applicable margin is a rate per annum between and depending on certain of our financial ratios and was at december  the term loan requires that we make quarterly principal payments  beginning in march  at the rate of cad  per quarter for all of and cad  per quarter from march through october   the termination date when all outstanding balances become due 
interest becomes due on a monthly or quarterly basis  depending on the interest rate method chosen 
the term loan allows us to prepay outstanding balances in whole or in part  at any time prior to the october  termination date

any amounts outstanding under the line of credit may be repaid and then re borrowed until october   the line of credit termination date when all outstanding balances become due 
interest on the line of credit is due monthly 
no borrowings under the line of credit were outstanding at december  we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of this line of credit  at a per annum rate equal to between and depending on certain of our financial ratios as of december  we incurred total financing fees in the amount of  relating to the multicurrency credit agreement 
these costs are being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the loan  which is five years 
as of december   we have recorded  of related amortization expense related to these fees 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements at item herein 
the multicurrency credit agreement generally contains limitations on certain investments  acquisitions and or mergers  and prohibits disposition of assets other than in the normal course of business 
additionally  we are required to maintain certain financial performance measures including minimum leverage and ebitda ratios  minimum net worth levels and maximum capital expenditures 
the payment of dividends is permitted under the term loan and line of credit facility and is limited only to the extent such payments affect our ability to meet certain financial performance measures thereunder 
the repurchase of our common stock is prohibited by the term loan and line of credit facility 
failure to maintain compliance with covenants could impair the availability of the facility 
the multicurrency credit agreement also restricts us from incurring additional indebtedness in excess of  with the exception of the  demand note outlined below 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the multicurrency credit agreement 
in october  we converted our previously existing  line of credit with a second bank  to a  revolving credit note the demand note 
outstanding borrowings under the demand note bear interest  payable monthly  at the bank s base rate at december   or if converted at our option  based upon the libor rate plus basis points totaling at december

as of december  and  no borrowings under the demand note or previous line of credit were outstanding 
we are subject to changes in variable interest rates on our borrowing facilities 
a significant increase in our borrowing rate could have a material adverse impact to our liquidity and cash flows 
based on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan at december   a increase in the interest rate would result in an additional  of annual interest 
table of contents expense 
in january  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit a portion of our interest rate risk associated with the term loan 
in accordance with the interest rate cap agreement  we are entitled to proceeds equal to the amount by which the canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptance rate exceeds multiplied by the notional amount of the hedge outstanding  as calculated on a pro rata  quarterly basis 
as of december   the canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptance rate was 
see note to the consolidated financial statements at item herein 
we generate positive cash flows from our operations and expect this trend to continue in both the short and long term 
additional uses of cash will be based on rate of return analyses  but may include investments in new technologies  products and or international licensees or markets  which may require substantial investments of capital 
we plan to continue to explore opportunities in international markets  including the potential for strategic partnerships  alliances and or equity investments 
during  we commenced activities to open new markets in italy and china 
we expect to begin operations in italy in and in china in late or early these strategies may require substantial investment in and beyond 
we intend to continue to develop new technologies and may introduce new products that leverage our brand recognition and reputation for vehicle recovery 
we expect to continue our level of investment in product development in similar to the levels invested in the company plans to fund its operations  including capital expenditures  using existing cash  cash flows from operations and  if needed  the existing line of credit and demand facilities discussed above 
we expect capital expenditures in to be as much as million 
if we pursue significant opportunities in international markets  we may be required to find additional sources of capital 
we believe the sources available to us will be adequate for our present and anticipated needs 
we finance our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operations 
this liquidity is contingent on continued customer demand for our products and services  and continuing our existing relationships with insurance companies  international licensees and certain law enforcement agencies 
we expect to continue these relationships 
we believe that we will be able to keep pace with required technological changes in our products and expect that our sales and marketing initiatives will continue to drive customer demand 
our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash increase in cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities increased by  during the year ended december   compared to the same period in the increase was due to an increase in net income of  a net increase in cash generated by deferred revenue of  primarily related to increased lojack early warning and warranty sales  offset by a net decrease in other assets and liabilities of  cash used in investing activities increased by  during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to  net of cash acquired  used to acquire boomerang in october and  used to invest in investment grade commercial paper  corporate bonds and us government and agency securities 
these increases were partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for lojack system infrastructure components  mainly vehicle tracking units and the absence in of additional investments in our foreign licensees as had occurred in 
table of contents cash provided by financing activities increased by  during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily reflecting additional proceeds of i  from a year term loan used to partially fund the acquisition of boomerang  ii  from the exercise of stock options  iii  from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan  and iv lower capital lease payments of  because  beginning in january  we began to enter into operating leases for new vehicles used by installation personnel 
as of december   we had working capital of  we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months using cash  cash flows from operations and  if necessary  drawing upon the our line of credit and demand facilities 
currently  we do not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not intend to establish any special purpose entities 
contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under various capital and operating lease agreements relating to our office locations  computer and office equipment  vehicles and tower infrastructure locations 
other substantial contractual obligations include long term debt  severance arrangements  non cancelable inventory purchase commitments and engineering agreements if project milestones are met 
we believe the attainment of the project milestones over the next to months is reasonably possible and estimable and  as such  these estimated milestones have been included in the table below 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments existing at december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations severance arrangements total off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k  item a ii 
factors that may affect future performance the private securities litigation reform act of and federal securities laws contain certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information we provide or statements made by our employees may contain forward looking information  which involves risk and uncertainty 
any statements in this report and accompanying materials that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the characteristics and growth of the our markets and customers  our objectives and plans for future operations and products and our expected liquidity and capital resources 
such forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  and accordingly  actual results could differ materially 
risk factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to any negative impact on the sales  licensing and marketing efforts of our principal product would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business depends primarily on the sale  licensing and market acceptance of a principal product  our lojack stolen vehicle recovery system  or lojack system  and related products and services in the united states and foreign countries and the boomerang stolen vehicle recovery system in canada 
because our revenues are dependent on the success of the principal products  any factor affecting its marketability could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
factors that could harm the successful sale and licensing of the product include all of the factors discussed under factors that may affect future performance including  among others if automobile dealers with whom we have relationships stop selling our product in connection with their vehicle sales  
table of contents if law enforcement agencies who currently utilize our lojack system in the united states do not renew our service contracts  if our foreign licensees are unable to establish a market for our products in their jurisdictions  if we are unable to develop enhancements to our products as required by market demand  if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  or if one or more of our competitors introduces a product or system that makes our products obsolete or ineffective 
failure to procure and maintain contracts with local law enforcement agencies would materially adversely affect the marketability of our lojack system which would inhibit sales in the united states and harm our business 
the lojack system is designed to be integrated into existing law enforcement computer systems and telecommunication systems and procedures 
a lojack unit  our tracking devices installed in purchasers vehicles  will not be effective if the automobile in which it is installed is located in a jurisdiction where our lojack system is not operational because we have not procured an agreement with local law enforcement agencies 
we have agreements covering domestic jurisdictions to varying degrees 
these agreements are generally for terms of up to five years 
renewal or extension of any of these agreements may be subject to competitive bidding 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew or extend our existing agreements with local law enforcement agencies or obtain agreements in new target jurisdictions in the future 
if we are unable to procure and maintain contracts with local law enforcement agencies in our target markets  our financial results will be materially and adversely affected 
our growth depends in part on the development  production and market acceptance of new products which we cannot assure you will happen successfully 
to maintain competitiveness in our industry we must support and enhance our existing products and develop new products in response to market demands 
product development involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty due to unforeseen difficulties and costs 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products that we believe are necessary to respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
in addition  our new product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
if the release date of any future products or enhancements are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our revenues may decrease  we may not be able to recover our costs and our competitive position may be harmed 
if our competitors develop products  systems or technologies that make our products obsolete or less competitive  our business would be harmed 
in recent years the number of companies developing and marketing wireless communications products that have security applications used directly in vehicles has expanded considerably 
we compete with other makers of stolen vehicle recovery devices 
we believe we also face competition from makers of vehicle security devices  such as alarms  because they compete with us for consumer funds in the automobile security products after market 
several competitors or potential competitors are marketing  or have announced the development of  competitive vehicle recovery systems and products aimed at our target market 
in addition  we believe that new market entrants may attempt to develop a system of theft detection or recovery that may be directly competitive with our products 
some of our existing or potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  service and support resources than we have and  as a result  are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their systems and products than we are able to devote to our systems and products 
if these or other competitors were to develop stolen vehicle recovery and tracking products comparable with our lojack or boomerang systems  
table of contents market a system capable of being operated or actively monitored by law enforcement agencies  or develop new and improved products or technologies that render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive  competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share and require us to reduce our prices and profit margins 
this could cause a decline in our revenues and adversely affect our operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against existing companies or new entrants to the marketplace 
economic downturns could reduce the level of consumer spending within the automobile industry  which could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
consumer spending in the automobile industry is often discretionary and may decline during economic downturns  when consumers have less disposable income 
approximately of our domestic sales for the year ended december  were made through a distribution network consisting of dealers that offer our lojack system as an option on both their new and used automobiles 
our primary focus for domestic growth involves increasing our sales through existing automobile dealer channels and markets 
consequently  any change in general economic conditions resulting in a significant decrease in dealer automobile sales could adversely impact our future revenues and earnings 
operations of our boomerang segment are currently heavily dependent on boomerang s alliance with wireless carriers and insurance companies 
wireless carriers are an integral facet of our boomerang system 
the continued availability and maintenance of the wireless telecommunications networks that we use is essential for operating the tracking system 
in particular  we closely monitor the evolution  availability and continued maintenance of the analog network we currently use and are evaluating the future use of digital networks in canada 
in addition  many insurance companies are strong supporters and advocates of the boomerang system 
the continued existence of these strategic alliances is important for the ongoing development of new and existing markets 
we are subject to government regulations and approvals which may limit the number of our potential customers or result in costs and delays that could impede our ability to competitively offer our services and products in the market 
we must obtain the approval of law enforcement agencies  as well as other governmental agencies  for implementation of our lojack system in any domestic jurisdiction 
the approval process may be time consuming and costly and  in some jurisdictions  governmental approvals we obtain may be terminable by the executive or legislative body 
moreover  our lojack system is operated by law enforcement agencies utilizing a frequency assigned by the federal communications commission for that purpose 
the operation of our lojack system depends on the continued availability of the frequency which we cannot guarantee 
the licensees of our lojack system operate in international markets and will likely encounter similar or additional regulatory requirements and uncertainties under local laws 
as we continue our expansion into international markets through our licensees we will face additional and varied local governmental regulations and approvals with which we must comply 
governmental regulations and approvals may limit the number of potential customers for our services or impede our ability to offer competitive services to our us and canadian markets and  through our foreign licensees  to our international markets  either of which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
economic  political and other risks associated with the operations of our international licensees could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
our licensed stolen vehicle recovery technology and rights are presently operational in international countries and territories through license arrangements with our foreign licensees 
we carry investments in several of  and hold sizeable receivables from  these licensees 
our international dealings in the future may be in the form of continuing to license our proprietary technology in additional international markets or in the form of equity investments in our foreign licensees 
approximately of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were derived from product and component sales of our lojack system to  and licensing and royalty revenues from  our international licensees 
the current forecast for our revenue and profit growth is partially contingent on the continuation of our license agreements with our licensees and the success of their operations 
changes to our licensees existing management teams  or failure of our licensees to meet their working capital needs or execute fully on their existing business plans  could negatively impact the carrying value of our investments  collectibility of our receivables and our target revenue and profits from our international segment 
moreover  our licensees operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside of the united states that our domestic competitors are not exposed to  including potentially weak protection of intellectual property rights  
table of contents economic and political instability  import or export licensing requirements  trade or currency restrictions  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world  such as during the summer months in europe  fluctuations in exchange rates  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could harm the operations of our licensees and  consequently  our business and operating results 
specifically  our licensees failure to effectively manage their growth could increase our anticipated operating costs  diminish or destroy the value of our equity investments in our licensees or delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in key international markets 
our failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire could disrupt our business and negatively impact our future financial condition and operating results 
the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company s operations  personnel  technologies and products 
in october  we acquired boomerang 
in the future  we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
the integration of boomerang  and any companies we might acquire in the future  could disrupt our business  divert our management s attention from our core business objectives and may involve unforeseen difficulties and costs 
any of these risks could negatively impact our ability to fully realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any business  technology or personnel that we have acquired or that we might acquire in the future in a timely manner  or at all  and this could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we may need additional financing in the future  which could be difficult to obtain on acceptable terms or at all 
it could also dilute your holdings in us 
we may require additional financing in order to make acquisitions or future investments in new technologies  products and or international licensees or markets  or to provide needed additional working capital 
we primarily finance our capital and operating needs through cash flows from operations  however  in the future we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to fund our activities 
if we issue additional equity securities  your holdings in us will be diluted and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
in addition  if we raise funds through debt financings  we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive and other covenants  which could negatively impact our business 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to make strategic investments  develop or enhance our products  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities  or otherwise respond to competitive challenges or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitiveness could be impeded and our business and operating results could be harmed 
our primary business strategy is to develop and market our products and technology successfully 
the long term success of this strategy depends in part upon us acquiring  maintaining and protecting proprietary rights to these products and technologies 
although we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements  we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our technology from misappropriation or infringement 
our competitors could successfully obtain exclusive intellectual property rights to technologies which they develop that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology  which would likely hurt our market position 
moreover  we cannot assure you that any of our existing intellectual property rights will not be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or rendered unenforceable 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which we offer or plan to offer our products through our foreign licensees may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and or canada  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation can be time consuming  distracting to management  expensive and difficult to predict 
our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if a court determines that our technology infringes on third parties intellectual property  we will likely face significant costs and we may lose our rights to the technology  which would harm our business 
we may be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows 
it is possible that we will inadvertently violate the intellectual property rights of other parties  and those third parties may choose to assert infringement claims against us 
if we are unsuccessful in any litigation based on a claim of infringement  in addition to exposure to substantial damages  we could be required to expend considerable resources to modify our products  to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to permit our continued use of the technology that is the subject matter of the litigation 
if we are unsuccessful at these endeavors we may be enjoined from using the technology subject to the infringement claim which  depending on its importance to our product line and business  could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could adversely affect our profits  perhaps significantly 
in addition  any future litigation to defend ourselves against allegations that we have infringed the rights of others could result in substantial costs to us  impede the development and sale of the affected product or intellectual property and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  even if we ultimately prevail 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply infrastructure components for our principal product 
if our suppliers cannot provide the components or services we require  our ability to market and sell our products could be harmed 
currently we rely on a single supplier to manufacture our lojack units  a critical component of our lojack system 
if our supplier fails to supply these components in a timely manner that meet our quantity  quality or cost requirements  or technical specifications  we cannot be assured that we will be able to access alternative sources of these components within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates 
a reduction or interruption in supply of the lojack units that we purchase from our suppliers  or a significant increase in the price of these units  could have a material adverse effect on our marketing and sales initiatives regarding our lojack system  which would hurt our business objectives and financial results 
in addition to our existing supplier  we are currently working with plextek limited  communications technology consultants  to develop a next generation lojack unit and we received our first shipments of the product in the first quarter of we expect to work with multiple companies to supply the lojack unit in order to mitigate the risks discussed above 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate agreements with multiple suppliers on acceptable terms in the future 
failure to create and maintain strategic relationships with qualified and effective third party installers could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we have established strategic relationships with a number of organizations that we believe are critical to the cost effective distribution of our products 
in  we began to use automobile dealers and distributors to install lojack units as part of various programs intended to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiencies in selling and installing lojack units 
our use of third party installers has continued to increase since then and we expect it to increase further in the future 
failure to continue existing relationships and form new relationships with third party installers would hurt our profits and revenue growth 
there is no guarantee that we will maintain these relationships or form new strategic relationships in the future 
in 
table of contents addition  although we monitor the quality of third party installations of our products through our quality control processes  we cannot assure you that services offered by third parties will meet our standards 
if we are unable to adequately address any performance issues by our third party installers we could lose sale opportunities which could harm our reputation and reduce our profits 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to market risk due to the nature of our financial instruments 
our financial instruments at december  consisted of cash and equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  customer deposits  accrued liabilities  capital lease obligations  long term debt and credit facilities 
the fair value of these financial instruments as of december   approximated their carrying values 
our short term investments are in the form of investment grade commercial paper  corporate bonds and us government and agency securities that are carried at fair value in the financial statements 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
interest rate exposure relates primarily to the effect of interest rate changes on amounts outstanding under our term loan for which there was cad  equivalent to us  of borrowings outstanding as of december  and our variable rate line of credit and demand facilities 
based on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan at december   a increase in the interest rate would result in an additional  of annual interest expense 
in january  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit a portion of our interest rate risk associated with the term loan 
in accordance with the interest rate cap agreement  we are entitled to proceeds equal to the amount by which the canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptance rate exceeds multiplied by the notional amount of the hedge outstanding  as calculated on a pro rata  quarterly basis 
as of december   the canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptance rate was 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item included herein 
there was no related interest rate exposure under our line of credit and demand facilities  as there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during historically  we have had minimal foreign currency exposure as most transactions with customers and vendors are denominated in us dollars 
in november  we entered into an agreement to convert  of a  note receivable from our argentine licensee to be denominated in argentine pesos 
as of december    was outstanding under this note 
as a reserve for of this note has been established  there is no foreign currency exposure reflected in the financial statements 
in december  we established a brazilian subsidiary  lojack do brasil  and purchase and sale transactions denominated in brazil s currency real began in may as of december   there were approximately  of us dollar denominated intercompany long term loans outstanding to lojack do brasil 
during the year ended december   transactions denominated in brazilian reals occurred 
if we encounter material foreign currency exposure with this foreign subsidiary in the future  we may elect to manage the related exposure by utilizing a hedging strategy 
in october  we completed our acquisition of boomerang  a canadian company with its functional currency of canadian dollars 
we expect to manage foreign exchange exposures that cause both earnings and cash volatility by utilizing a hedging strategy 
in january  we entered into four foreign currency hedge contracts  that mature over each of the next four quarters  to hedge a portion of anticipated canadian dollar denominated sales against currency fluctuations 
the contracts  with notional value totaling cad  have maturity dates from march  through december  we will record changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we will reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to income 
currently  we do not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
we have not established any special purpose entities and do not have any material off balance sheet financing transactions
