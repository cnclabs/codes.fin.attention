item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the ownership  management and development of hotels  resorts and timeshare properties and the franchising of lodging properties 
at december   our system contained  properties totaling over  rooms worldwide 
our brands include hilton  hilton garden inn  doubletree  embassy suites  hampton  homewood suites by hilton and conrad 
in addition  we develop and operate timeshare resorts through hilton grand vacations company and its related entities 
we are also engaged in various other activities related or incidental to the operation of hotels 
the number of properties and rooms at december  by brand and by type are as follows brand properties rooms type properties rooms hilton owned hilton garden inn leased doubletree joint venture embassy suites homewood suites by hilton managed hampton franchised other timeshare timeshare total total includes majority owned and controlled hotels 
our operations consist of three reportable segments which are based on similar products or services hotel ownership  managing and franchising  and timeshare 
the hotel ownership segment derives earnings from owned  majority owned and leased hotel properties and equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily hotel and other real estate joint ventures 
the managing and franchising segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our family of brands to franchisees 
this segment generates its revenue from fees charged to hotel owners 
as a manager of hotels  we are typically responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for fees based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenue  operating profits  cash flow  or a combination thereof 
we charge franchise fees  depending on the brand  of up to five percent of rooms revenue in exchange for the use of one of our brand names 
the timeshare segment consists of multi unit timeshare resorts 
this segment sells and finances timeshare intervals and operates timeshare resorts 
the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature 
however  the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend principally upon location 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels  our ability to manage costs  the relative mix of owned  leased  managed and franchised hotels  the quantity and pricing of timeshare interval sales and the change in the number of available hotel rooms and timeshare intervals through acquisition  development and disposition 
results are also impacted by economic conditions and capacity 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which  in turn  could limit our ability to pass through operating cost increases in the form of higher room rates 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
see additional information business risks and forward looking statements under item for a description of these and other conditions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we anticipate that a favorable economic environment will continue to benefit the lodging industry and our company in a continuation of strong hotel demand among business  group and leisure travelers  combined with limited full service hotel supply growth  should enable us to charge higher room rates 
we also anticipate growth in our management and franchise fee business as the number of hotels in our system continues to increase  as well as another strong year from our timeshare business 
challenges in are expected to include continued short reservation lead times for our group business and increasing costs 
increases in energy  healthcare and insurance costs combined with higher property taxes are expected to put pressure on margins 
we will continue to focus on managing our costs  achieving revenue per available room revpar premiums in the markets where we operate  increasing occupancy  adding new units to our family of brands  leveraging technology and delivering outstanding customer service 
we believe that our focus on these core strategies  combined with our financial strength  diverse market presence  strong brands and strategically located properties will enable us to remain competitive 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
notes receivable are reflected net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
for timeshare notes receivable  this estimate is based primarily on historical experience and assumptions with respect to future payment trends 
allowances for uncollectible amounts of other notes receivable  which includes notes from managed  franchised and unconsolidated joint venture properties  are estimated based primarily on historical trends and analysis of underlying real estate collateral 
assessment of collateral may include estimates of future cash flow from the underlying real estate 
total notes receivable  including timeshare  totaled million and million  net of allowances for uncollectible amounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we also maintain cost and equity method investments in entities that own and operate hotel properties and entities that perform other activities related or incidental to the operation of hotels 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make certain judgments  including estimates of real estate values and future cash flow from the respective properties and investments 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
results in and include pre tax impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the value of property and equipment to estimated fair value 
we account for the sale of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas  accounting for sales of real estate 
to the extent we realize gains from the sale of real estate and maintain significant continuing involvement in the form of a long term management contract  the gain is deferred and recognized in earnings over the term of the contract 
the deferral of pre tax gains on such sales totaled million and million in and  respectively 
results in  and include the recognition of pre tax deferred gains totaling million  million and million  respectively 
the deferral of gain recognition is dependent on the structure of individual sale transactions 
our intangible assets include management and franchise contracts  leases  brands and goodwill 
the values of our management and franchise contracts and leases are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the agreements 
the assessment of management and franchise contracts and leases requires us to make certain judgments  including estimates of future cash flow from the respective properties 
results in include a million pre tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of a management contract to fair value 
management and franchise contracts  net  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we account for brands and goodwill in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are reviewed annually for impairment 
the annual impairment review requires estimates of future cash flow with respect to the brands and estimates of the fair value of our company and its components with respect to goodwill 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental insurance coverage at our owned locations 
we purchase insurance coverage for claim amounts which exceed our self insured retentions 
depending on the type of insurance  these self insured retention amounts range from  to  per claim 
the undiscounted amount of our self insurance reserves totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
our insurance reserves are accrued based on estimates of the present value of claims expected to occur during the covered period 
these estimates are prepared with the assistance of outside actuaries and consultants 
our actuaries periodically review the volume and amount of claims activity  and based upon their findings  we adjust our insurance reserves accordingly 
the ultimate cost of claims for a covered period may differ from our original estimates 
general liability and workers compensation claim estimates are discounted to determine the present value of projected settlements  the discount rates used in the through program years were approximately to  which we considered reasonable based on claims settlement patterns 
since medical and dental claims are generally paid within several months  we do not discount the related insurance reserves 
we have issued letters of credit and guaranteed certain debt and obligations of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties totaling million at december  under certain circumstances  we may be obligated to provide additional guarantees or letters of credit totaling million 
assessment of the probability that we will be required to fund under these commitments requires us to make estimates of the ability of others to meet their obligations 
the estimates and assumptions related to notes receivable  long lived assets  intangible assets  commitments and self insurance reserves are subject to change based on the factors identified above 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and have resulted in accurate measurement of the related accounts in our historical financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
because estimates are used  it is reasonably likely that there will be some variability between projected results and actual results over time 
in addition  given the significance of these accounts to our consolidated financial position  the variability between projected and actual results could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
development and capital spending overview we intend to grow our hotel system primarily through franchising and the addition of management contracts  which require little or no capital investment 
we will also continue to invest in capital improvements and select projects at our owned hotels and the development of timeshare properties 
in addition  we may seek to acquire ownership interests in hotel properties on a strategic and selective basis  either directly or through investments in joint ventures 
see joint ventures alliances below 
during  we added a total of properties to our system  primarily franchises  with approximately  rooms 
a total of properties  mostly franchises  with approximately  rooms were removed from our system in primarily due to product quality issues 
we expect to add to hotels with  to  rooms to our system in  with hampton and hilton garden inn accounting for most of the new development 
we expect virtually all of this growth to be through franchise and management agreements 
we believe our brand growth strategy continues to benefit from the significant market share premiums most of our brands command over their respective competitive sets 
with representing a brand s fair share of the market  our brands according to smith travel research posted revenue per available room revpar index numbers as follows for embassy suites   hampton inn   homewood suites by hilton   hilton garden inn   hilton   and doubletree  in addition  we were ranked number one in the hotel industry for customer satisfaction according to statistics from the american customer satisfaction index released in june  representing our third first place ranking in five years 
in july  it was announced that both hilton garden inn and homewood suites by hilton earned first place rankings for customer satisfaction in their respective categories from j 
d 
power associates  while embassy suites and hampton inn each garnered top three rankings in their categories 
we believe the continued strong performance of our brands has enabled us to significantly enhance our development pipeline versus our industry competitors 
we had approximately hotels  primarily franchises  with  rooms in our development pipeline at december  the consummation of transactions in our development pipeline is subject to various conditions and uncertainties 
our ability to grow the number of hotels in our system is affected by the factors set forth under additional information business risks and forward looking statements  under item  such as national and regional economic conditions  the effects of actual and threatened terrorist attacks and international conflicts  credit availability  relationships with franchisees and property owners  and competition from other hotel brands 
in total  we anticipate spending approximately million on capital expenditures in  which includes million on routine improvements  million for timeshare projects and million in hotel renovation  roi and special projects 
routine improvements include expenditures for equipment  hotel fixtures  and wall and floor coverings 
expenditures required to complete our capital spending programs will be financed through available cash flow and general corporate borrowings 
anticipated capital expenditures are subject to change due to  among other things  changes in business operations and economic conditions 
we will continue to review our owned hotel portfolio for potential repositioning or rebranding opportunities and may seek to sell certain assets see liquidity and capital resources acquisitions and dispositions and joint ventures alliances 
it is our intention to be opportunistic when evaluating potential asset sales and we may look to sell particular hotel properties to the extent we can obtain premium prices 
when we sell a hotel property  it is generally our preference to retain a management or franchise agreement  however  we may sell hotels without maintaining our brand on the property sold 
hotel ownership capital expenditures during excluding timeshare projects totaled million  consisting primarily of routine improvements and technology capital expenditures 
we continue to place a priority on making appropriate capital expenditures to maintain our owned assets and improve technology at our properties 
in response to enthusiastic customer response regarding ease of use and time savings  we are installing self service check in kiosks at our larger hotels 
we have installed these kiosks at of our owned and managed hotels as of december  in addition  we spent approximately million in to upgrade the bedding and televisions at our owned and leased hotels 
managing and franchising total property additions to our system in included franchise properties and five managed properties owned by third parties 
these additions included properties which  due in part to the market share leadership of our brands  were converted to our family of brands in the conversions included six doubletrees  five hamptons  three hiltons  one embassy suites and one hilton garden inn 
during  we announced the development of the first embassy suites hotel in mexico  scheduled to open in in mexico city 
pursuant to a joint venture with hilton international  new managed conrad hotels opened in bali  indonesia in the first quarter of and in miami  florida in the third quarter of during  we signed agreements to manage a new suite conrad hotel on the las vegas strip and a new room conrad hotel in downtown indianapolis  both of which are expected to open in the growth in the conrad brand will continue to be primarily through management contracts 
in march  we converted the former adam s mark hotel in memphis to a room hilton following a major renovation 
in april  we opened the hilton omaha in nebraska  which is our third hilton managed convention hotel opened since december during  an affiliate of usaa real estate co 
acquired six doubletree properties from a third party and started renovation projects at these properties 
two of the six properties are located in houston and the remaining four are located in kansas city  anaheim  st 
louis and tulsa 
also in  we introduced make it hampton  a brand improvement program that will bring a wide range of new products and services to the hampton system 
timeshare we are currently developing new timeshare projects in las vegas  nevada and orlando  florida and  in  we began development of a new timeshare project in waikoloa  hawaii 
this project will have units and is scheduled for completion in early at our international drive property in orlando  the project has units in its first two phases  with phase one completed in february and phase two completed in april construction is continuing on the next units  with units scheduled to open in spring and units scheduled to open in mid we broke ground in february on another units at this property  with completion scheduled for spring also in orlando  we are adding units to our existing property adjacent to sea world 
in the third quarter of  we began development of the second phase of the property on the las vegas strip  a story  unit tower scheduled to open in mid upon the opening of phase two  approximately half of the planned four tower   unit project will have been completed 
capital expenditures associated with our timeshare operations during totaled million 
timeshare capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately million in as we continue to invest in the development of new product in las vegas  orlando and hawaii 
the capital expenditures associated with our non lease timeshare products are reflected as inventory until the timeshare intervals are sold 
we also provide financing to the buyers of our timeshare intervals 
during  we issued approximately million of loans related to timeshare financings 
principal collections on timeshare notes during the same period were approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net increase in relates primarily to improved operating results and net cash provided by timeshare sales in excess of new timeshare construction during the year 
the increase in cash from operating activities also reflects timing differences resulting in an increased minimum pension liability and the deferral of revenue on timeshare sales 
these increases were partially offset by increases in restricted cash and an increase in the net balance of timeshare notes receivable 
the decrease in compared to was due primarily to lower operating results  an increase in inventories related to additional timeshare spending  an increase in restricted cash and an increase in the net balance of timeshare notes receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and each benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance for capital loss tax carryforwards and other items which reduced the provision for income taxes see liquidity and capital resources asset dispositions  joint ventures alliances below and note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 
our ability to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards to reduce our provision for income taxes is dependent on the availability of capital loss tax carryforwards and the existence of transactions that enable these capital loss carryforwards to be utilized 
therefore  it should not be assumed that such benefits will be available to us in the future 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in and net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in the increase of million in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to reduced proceeds from asset dispositions in compared to the prior year  as well as an increase in additional investments in this increase in cash used was partially offset by higher payments received on non timeshare notes receivable in net cash used in investing activities totaled million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the increase in cash provided by investing activities in was primarily due to increased proceeds from asset dispositions in compared to  as well as the absence of acquisition activity in in comparison to  which included the acquisition of the hilton waikoloa village 
in addition  capital expenditures in were lower than  as significant construction projects at the hilton portland  hilton new orleans riverside and the hilton san francisco were completed in net cash used in financing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in reflects a lower level of debt repayment in the period as all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility were repaid in the second quarter of the period also includes higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock  reflecting a higher volume of stock option exercises 
this combined decrease in the net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by share repurchases in net cash used in investing activities in and primarily represents the repayment of long term debt in excess of additional long term borrowings 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities in compared to reflects higher proceeds from increased stock option exercises in the period 
for the three years ended december   total debt has been reduced by approximately billion 
our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december   and was x  x and x  respectively 
cash and equivalents totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  restricted cash totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year 
restricted cash includes cash related to certain consolidated hotels  the use of which is restricted for hotel purposes under the terms of collateralized borrowings  refundable deposits on the sale of timeshare intervals  and cash balances held by a consolidated non controlled entity 
we believe that our operating cash flow  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and our ability to obtain additional financing through various financial markets are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
however  any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty 
see results of operations below and additional information business risks and forward looking statements under item for further discussion of conditions that could adversely affect our estimates of future financial needs and sources of working capital

the terms of any additional securities offered under the shelf will be determined by market conditions at the time of issuance 
in connection with the spin off in of our gaming business to a new corporation named park place entertainment corporation subsequently renamed caesars entertainment inc  caesars assumed and agreed to pay of the amount of each payment required to be made by us under the terms of the indentures governing our million senior notes due caesars repaid these notes  as scheduled  in july because these notes were our legal obligation  they are reported in our consolidated balance sheet as current maturities of long term debt with the offsetting receivable classified in current assets 
provisions under various loan agreements require us to comply with certain covenants which include limiting the amount of our outstanding indebtedness 
our revolving credit facility contains two significant financial covenants a leverage ratio and a debt service coverage ratio 
we are in compliance with our loan covenants as of december  provisions of the financing agreement related to our collateralized borrowings due require that certain cash reserves be maintained and also restrict the transfer of excess cash generated by the related properties to hilton if net cash flow falls below a specified level the cash trap 
the cash trap became effective in due to reduced cash flow from the collateralized properties  primarily the hilton san francisco 
as of december   cash restricted under the terms of the collateralized borrowings  including required reserves and the cash trap  totaled million 
the impact of the cash trap  which is expected to remain in effect throughout  is not expected to have a material impact on our liquidity

we also have commitments under letters of credit totaling million as of december  in april  we funded a loan guarantee of approximately million and recorded a corresponding receivable from the party for which we funded the guarantee 
based on remedies available to us upon an event of default by the borrower  we believe that the receivable related to this funding should be fully realized

results of operations the following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the three years ended december  our operations consist of three reportable segments which are based on similar products or services hotel ownership  managing and franchising  and timeshare 
fiscal compared with fiscal overview a summary of our consolidated results for the years ended december  and is as follows change in millions  except per share amounts revenue operating income net income basic eps diluted eps results in benefited from revpar growth at our comparable owned hotels due to increased demand from both business travelers and group business  combined with continued strong demand from leisure travelers 
this shift in the mix of business to more higher rated room nights from business travelers and groups resulted in increased pricing power in fee income increased in as a result of revpar growth at managed and franchised hotels and the addition of new units 
results in also benefited from strong results at our timeshare business and lower interest expense 
overall results in were adversely impacted by business declines related to the conflict in iraq and a soft us economy 
in addition  was negatively impacted by a pre tax impairment charge totaling million and cost increases at our owned hotels 
results in also reflect the implementation of fin r  which resulted in the consolidation of a previously unconsolidated managed hotel  effective january  the implementation of fin r resulted in an increase in other revenue and expenses from managed and franchised properties and certain other expenses in however  it had no impact on reported net income or net income per share 
revenue from owned hotels totaled billion in  a two percent increase from billion in  and total expenses in were flat with at billion 
strong results at our comparable owned hotels were partially offset by the impact of asset sales 
excluding the impact of assets sales  owned hotel revenue increased seven percent from billion in to billion in  while owned hotel expenses increased five percent from billion in to billion in results at our comparable owned properties improved versus due to business and group travel gains  combined with strong leisure demand 
the more favorable mix of business helped drive an increase in average rate  particularly in the latter half of the year 
the strong group business also led to an increase in food and beverage profits in results at our owned hotels in also benefited from our continued focus on costs 
cost per occupied room increased less than one percent in profitability at our owned hotels in was negatively impacted by the aforementioned soft us economy and reduced travel as a result of the conflict in iraq  along with increased healthcare  insurance and property tax costs 
margins at our comparable owned hotels revenue less expenses as a percentage of revenue for comparable owned hotels improved basis points compared to the prior year 
revpar for comparable owned properties increased percent for the year  with occupancy rising points to percent and average daily rate up percent to 
our owned properties in boston  new york and hawaii achieved particularly strong results in as anticipated  our owned properties in downtown chicago posted weaker results compared to due to a reduction in the number of citywide conventions in this market 
excluding the impact of chicago from both periods  revpar for comparable owned properties increased percent in although we anticipate a continuation of short reservation lead times for our group business in  we expect to see improvement in the chicago market 
in addition  we expect that a favorable economic environment will continue to benefit our owned hotels 
a continuation of the strong demand trends combined with limited full service hotel supply growth should result in a continuation of the pricing power we achieved in  particularly in many of our important markets  including new york  washington  boston and hawaii 
leased hotel revenue totaled million in  an eight percent increase compared to  while leased hotel expenses increased five percent to million 
due to the relatively large size of the lease payments required in a hotel operating lease  the leased properties operate at margins significantly lower than our owned hotels 
leased hotel revenue and expenses are included with our owned hotels in our hotel ownership segment results 
operating income from unconsolidated affiliates increased million in to million 
the increase is primarily the result of million in pre tax earnings from a joint venture that developed a unit condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina

operating income from unconsolidated affiliates is included in our hotel ownership segment results 
management and franchise fee revenue in increased million or percent to million 
fee revenue is based primarily on rooms revenue at franchise properties and total operating revenue and to a lesser extent gross operating profits or cash flow at managed properties 
the strong demand among business  groups and leisure travelers that benefited our owned hotels also resulted in strong revpar gains for each of our brands on a system wide basis including managed and franchised properties 
the increase in management and franchise fees in also reflects the addition of new units to our system of hotels 
we expect management and franchise fees will continue to increase in due to favorable economic trends and continued growth in our system of managed and franchised hotels 
revenue from our timeshare operations included in timeshare and other income totaled million in  an increase of million from million in  while timeshare expenses included in other operating expenses in totaled million  an increase of million from million in the prior year

overall timeshare unit sales were up percent in  with robust sales at our projects in hawaii  las vegas and orlando 
the average unit price increased five percent across the system 
timeshare revenue and profitability also benefited from higher resort fees and higher financing income due to increased sales 
the growth from increased sales volume and price were partially offset by unfavorable deferrals of sales revenue net of related expenses compared to the period  due to the required percentage of completion accounting 
results in were negatively impacted by the deferral of revenue and expenses at our waikoloa project  as construction was not beyond a preliminary stage 
in contrast  results in benefited from the recognition of previously deferred revenue and expenses as phases of our developments in orlando and las vegas were substantially completed or opened during depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million in to million 
the period includes a million one time depreciation expense reduction at certain properties

as these notes were assumed by caesars but remained our legal obligation prior to repayment  interest on the notes is reflected both in interest income and interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
this decrease in interest income was partially offset by interest received in on a favorable tax settlement of a prior year federal income tax matter and interest received on certain notes receivable that had been previously reserved 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  decreased million reflecting lower outstanding debt balances  as well as the aforementioned repayment by caesars 
the million pre tax loss on asset dispositions and other in represents the sale of two doubletree properties and the write off of the value assigned to several long term management and franchise agreements which were terminated during the year  partially offset by the gain from the sale of our investment in travelweb see liquidity and capital resources asset dispositions 
the million pre tax loss on asset dispositions and other in represents the sale of four homewood suites by hilton hotel properties  one embassy suites property and the write off of the value assigned to several long term management and franchise contracts which were terminated during the year  partially offset by the gain on the sale of certain marketable securities 
the loss from non operating affiliates totaling million in represents equity losses associated with our percent minority interest in a coal based synthetic fuel facility 
the synthetic fuel produced at this facility qualifies for tax credits based on section of the internal revenue code  these credits reduce our provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for increased to from in the effective tax rate in benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance for capital loss tax carryforwards resulting from the sale of three doubletree properties la posada in arizona  as well as bakersfield and modesto in california and the sale of our interest in travelweb

under previous accounting guidance  we generally have included another entity in our consolidated financial statements only if we have a controlling financial interest in the entity through voting or other interests 
fin changed that guidance by requiring a variable interest entity vie  as defined  to be consolidated by the company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
the losses and residual returns are based on the potential variability from the anticipated cash flow of the vie attributable to the holders of variable interests 
fin also requires disclosure about vies that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
our evaluation of the provisions of fin as it relates to our various forms of arrangements has focused primarily on reviewing the key terms of our joint venture agreements  management contracts and franchise agreements against the criteria in fin to determine if any of these arrangements qualify as vies 
in general  a vie represents a structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or that has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
however  other contractual arrangements could qualify an entity as a vie and designate which party to the contract is the primary beneficiary 
in the first quarter of  we adopted fin for vies created after january   which resulted in no impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin fin r that replaced the original interpretation and codified proposed modifications and other decisions previously issued through certain fasb staff positions  including the deferral of the effective date of applying fin r to certain variable interests created before february  we adopted fin r in the first quarter of except as described in the following paragraphs  our joint venture agreements  management contracts and franchise agreements are not variable interests  and therefore are not subject to the consolidation and disclosure provisions of fin r 
our evaluation of our joint venture agreements  management contracts and franchise agreements has identified two managed hotels in which we have variable interests  due to the terms of performance guarantees 
the performance guarantee associated with one of the hotel management agreements does not expose us to the majority of expected cash flow variability and therefore this hotel is not consolidated 
our maximum exposure to loss on this contract consists of future management fees and our potential obligation to fund the performance guarantee which  as of december   totaled an aggregate amount of approximately million through the second of the two contracts contains provisions that expose us to the majority of expected cash flow variability 
as a result  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary under fin r and are required to consolidate the balance sheet and results of operations of the hotel 
therefore  this previously unconsolidated managed hotel has been consolidated as of january  our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes the assets and liabilities of this non controlled hotel  including million of cash and equivalents reflected as restricted cash and million of debt which is non recourse to us 
the debt is secured by the fixed assets of the hotel with a historical cost of million 
the net equity of the hotel is a retained deficit of approximately million as of december  and is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet in other assets 
the revenue and operating expenses of this property are included in other revenue and expenses from managed and franchised properties in the consolidated statements of income 
our financial exposure to this property consists of the fees we earn under the management agreement and costs we may incur under the performance guarantee 
the net effect of the other earnings of this property  which belong to the hotel owners  are reversed from our consolidated results through minority and non controlled interests expense in the consolidated statements of income 
as a result  the implementation of fin r had no impact on reported net income or net income per share 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus regarding accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
in november  the eitf changed the transition provisions of the consensus to require that the guidance be applied to reporting periods ending after december  under current interpretations of fas  earnings per share  issuers of contingently convertible debt exclude the potential common shares underlying the debt instrument from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the contingency is met 
the eitf consensus requires that potential shares underlying the debt instrument should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether the contingency has been met 
our consolidated debt balance includes million of contingently convertible debt  which was issued in the second quarter of our calculation of diluted earnings per share for reflects the impact of the required implementation of eitf as required  the consensus has been retroactively applied to all periods during which the instrument was outstanding 
the retroactive application to did not result in a change to previously reported earnings per share for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued fas r  share based payment  which eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
fas r also requires that the tax benefit associated with these share based payments be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flow rather than operating activities as currently permitted 
fas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
fas r offers alternative adoption methods 
we have not yet determined which alternative method we will use 
as permitted by fas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options 
the adoption of fas r will result in increased compensation expense in our reported results 
had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the notes to consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation under item in december  the fasb issued fas  accounting for real estate time sharing transactions 
fas amends existing accounting guidance to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time sharing transactions provided in aicpa statement of position  accounting for real estate time sharing transactions 
fas is effective for our financial statements issued after january  the new accounting guidance requires  among other things  that costs incurred to sell timeshare units generally be charged to expense as incurred  including marketing expenses 
this is consistent with our existing accounting treatment and is not expected to impact our reported results 
the new standard will also require a change in the classification of certain items currently reported as expenses  requiring these items to be reflected as reductions of revenue 
the impact to reported revenue is not expected to be significant  and timeshare operating income will not be affected 
fas will also impact the timing of expense recognition when pre sales of projects under construction occur and we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we are currently allowed to defer sales and marketing expenses in the same proportion as the deferred revenue during construction 
fas allows only the deferral of direct sales and marketing expenses 
this will result in earlier recognition of sales and marketing expenses during the construction period  but will not impact the total sales and marketing expenses recognized 
the impact of this change is dependent on the timing and duration of construction and the extent of pre sales  however  it is not expected to affect reported results in other we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business 
management believes that resolution of pending litigation against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the form of changes in interest rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flow from our floating rate debt and the fair values of our fixed rate debt 
we attempt to limit the impact of changes in interest rates to our debt portfolio by attaining an appropriate mix of floating rate borrowings relative to our long term fixed rate debt 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable and the fair values of our fixed rate notes receivable 
we utilize  on a selective basis  interest rate swaps to manage our relative levels of fixed and floating rate debt 
as of december   we had a derivative contract which swaps the fixed interest payments on our million senior notes due to a floating interest rate equal to the six month libor rate plus basis points 
we also have a derivative contract which swaps the floating rate mortgage of one of our majority owned hotels  which had a principal balance of million at december   to a fixed interest rate 
we are also exposed to market risk in the form of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flow related to our foreign currency denominated debt 
in august  we issued million of bonds due denominated in chilean pesos 
payments of principal and interest on the bonds are adjusted for movements of the unidad de fomento the chilean inflation index published monthly by the central bank of chile 
we have swapped out the chilean currency exchange rate and inflation risk by entering into a derivative contract which swaps the principal payment to a fixed us dollar amount of million with fixed interest payments at of that amount 
we believe it is unlikely that the counterparty will be unable to perform under the terms of the derivative instrument 
concurrent with our investment in a synthetic fuel facility in august  we entered into a derivative contract covering million barrels of oil  which is effective for the calendar year ending december  the derivative contract involves two call options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the full year average trading price of oil in relation to the strike price of each option 
if the average price of oil in is less than  the derivative will yield no payment 
if the average price of oil exceeds  the derivative will yield a payment equal to the excess of the average price over per barrel  multiplied by the number of barrels covered  up to a maximum price per barrel of the purpose of the transaction is to provide economic protection against an increase in oil prices that could limit the amount of tax credits available under section of the internal revenue code 
the strike prices of the two call options are intended to approximate the price ranges under which the tax credit could be reduced or eliminated by an increase in oil prices
