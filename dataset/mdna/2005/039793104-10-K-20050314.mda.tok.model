item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
excludes dividends payable 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that owns  manages  leases  develops  renovates and acquires commercial properties located in southern california 
we are a full service real estate organization managed by senior executive officers who have experience in the real estate industry ranging from to years and who collectively have an average of years of experience 
we perform all property management  construction management  accounting  finance  acquisition and disposition activities and a majority of our leasing transactions with our staff of approximately employees 
as of december   we were southern california s largest publicly traded office landlord as measured by total net rentable square feet owned 
as of that date  our portfolio consisted of primarily suburban office properties and buildings containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
as of december   our operating portfolio was occupied 
our primary business strategy is to actively manage our portfolio to achieve gains in rental rates and occupancy  control operating expenses and maximize income from ancillary operations and services 
when market conditions permit  we may also selectively develop or acquire new properties that add value and fit strategically into our portfolio 
we may also sell existing properties and use the net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness or place into investments that we believe will generate higher long term value 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting estimates  as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all the company s significant accounting policies see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements including our reported operating results 
because over of our assets as of december  and  respectively  consists of investments in real estate and amounts due from tenants  our primary evaluations consist of recoverability of amounts invested in real estate properties and collectability of amounts due from tenants 
revenue recognition we recognize minimum rent  including rental abatements and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases  on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the amount by which straight line rental income differs from cash rents billed under the lease is included in deferred rents 
allowance for rents and other receivables we periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from particular tenants based on a variety of factors including the tenant s payment history  our observation of space utilization  periodic discussions with the tenants regarding the tenant s short and long term business plan for the space under contract  the overall financial health of the business and or parent company  available financial and other information regarding the tenant or its parent company and the amount of lease security on hand 
based on these factors  unless collection is reasonably assured  we fully reserve amounts due that are in excess of the lease security we hold 
all of our allowances are tenant specific 

table of contents as of december  and we had a total of million and million in our allowance for doubtful accounts and other reserves  respectively  representing approximately and of the total rent and deferred rent balance outstanding at each respective balance sheet date 
including security deposits and existing letters of credit  as of december  and  we had a total of million and million of total lease security available  respectively 
for the years ended december   and our bad debt expense related to losses for uncollected rents  deferred rents  tenants reimbursements and other uncollectible charges were approximately  and of total gross revenue  respectively  for each of those years 
our allowances have historically proved to be adequate  however  due to the uncertainty inherent in the tenant specific evaluation process  our allowance for doubtful accounts may not prove to be sufficient in all future periods 
commercial properties impairment of assets the recoverability of amounts invested in real estate properties is highly dependent on the assumptions we use 
for properties we intend to hold and operate  we recognize a write down to estimated fair value whenever a property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than its depreciated cost 
for properties we intend to sell  we recognize a write down to estimated fair value whenever a property s estimated sales price less costs to sell are less than its depreciated costs 
we determine fair value of our properties using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers  including comparison of carrying costs on a per square foot basis to sales price on a per square foot basis on recently transacted properties that are similar in quality and location and also by comparing carrying costs to acquisition offers from prospective buyers 
based on our assessment  no write downs to estimated fair value were necessary as of december  and due to the availability of comparable sales information in most of our sub markets  historically our fair value estimates have proven to be accurate 
however  our estimates may vary from actual values  especially for real estate assets located in sub markets where quoted per square foot market prices for comparable properties may not be readily available or real estate assets that become impaired due to non recurring circumstances such as previously unknown environmental issues or casualty losses that result in damages in excess of our insurance coverage amount 
property acquisitions the amounts paid for properties acquired are allocated between the tangible and intangible assets 
tangible assets include land  building and tenant improvements 
intangible assets include the value of in place leases 
to arrive at the value of in place leases  we compare estimates of current market rents to the in place rents 
we also make assumptions regarding the amount of time that currently occupied space would remain vacant if we had to replace the existing tenants under current market conditions 
we also reduce the value of each lease using a discount rate that we deem to be commensurate with each tenant s credit profile 
the assumptions we use are based on available market information  from independent sources and our own market knowledge and experience 
the fair market value that we assign to acquired leases is amortized over the remaining lease terms 
the tangible assets assigned to building improvements are depreciated over a much longer period of time  normally forty years 
consequently  the assumptions we use in this allocation have a significant impact on the operating results that we will report in future periods 
we cannot guarantee that the initial assumptions that we use to any property s purchase price will prove to be accurate 
we also would not revise these estimates in future periods if our initial amounts were proven to be inaccurate 
qualification as a reit since our taxable year ended december   we have been organized and operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  
table of contents asset diversification  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions subject to interpretation 
if we failed to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
for additional information see risk factors we may suffer adverse tax consequences and be unable to attract capital if we fail to qualify as a reit  and our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that it will qualify  elsewhere in this form k 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or obligations including contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents results of operations our financial position and operating results are primarily comprised of our portfolio of properties and income derived from those properties 
therefore  the comparability of financial data from period to period will be affected by the timing of significant property development  acquisitions and dispositions 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  in thousands  except number of properties and percentages year ended december  percent change change revenue from rental operations scheduled cash rents straight line rents tenant reimbursements parking  net of expense other rental operations total revenue from rental operations property expenses repairs and maintenance utilities real estate taxes insurance ground rent administrative total property expenses property operating results general and administrative interest depreciation and amortization interest and other loss income from continuing operations before gain on sale of properties and minority interest discontinued operations  net of minority interest number of properties acquired during period completed and placed in service during period disposed of during period owned at end of period net rentable square feet acquired during period completed and placed in service during period expansion space placed in service disposed of during period owned at end of period same property portfolio revenue from rental operations property expenses straight line rents number of properties number of buildings average occupancy net rentable square feet 
table of contents the components outlined above comprise our property operating results 
property operating results is a non gaap measure of performance 
property operating results is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our office properties and to determine trends in earnings 
property operating results is also employed by investors as one of the components used to estimate the value of our properties 
property operating results is used for the purposes noted above because it is not affected by the cost of funds of the property owner  the impact of depreciation and amortization expense as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap or general and administrative expenses and other specific costs such as permanent impairments to carrying costs 
the cost of funds is eliminated from net income because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner 
the cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital  which may have changed or may change in the future 
depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our office properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions 
while certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization  the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased in value as a result of changes in overall economic conditions as well as the actual use of the property or the passage of time 
gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period 
these gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases and subsequent sales 
general and administrative expenses and other owner specific costs such as impairment losses are eliminated because these costs are also in large part specific to the ownership structure and timing of purchases of the owner 
we believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our office properties as well as trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
however  the usefulness of property operating results is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs  interest expense  interest income  depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties  changes in value in our real estate properties that result from use or permanent impairment to carrying costs as stipulated by gaap  the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which are significant economic costs 
property operating results may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness 
property operating results is a measure of the operating performance of our office properties but does not measure our performance as a whole 
property operating results is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with gaap 
this measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with gaap and discussions elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of property operating results 
other companies may use different methods for calculating property operating results or similarly entitled measures and  accordingly  our property operating results may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do 
the following is a reconciliation of property operating results to net income computed in accordance with gaap in thousands year ended december  net income add general and administrative expense interest expense depreciation and amortization minority interest interest and other loss impairment on investment in securities less interest and other income gain on sale of discontinued properties discontinued operations  net of minority interest gain on sale of operating properties property operating results consists of non development renovation properties classified as part of continuing and discontinued operations that were owned for the entirety of the periods presented 
variances for results of operations our property operating results for the year ended december  compared to were primarily affected by our acquisitions and development activities since january  
table of contents as a result of these changes within our portfolio of properties since january   we do not believe the property operating results presented above are comparable from period to period 
therefore  in the table above  we have also presented the property operating results for our same property portfolio 
revenue from rental operations revenue from rental operations increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to our december acquisition of a  square foot office property in san diego county in december of  revenues from our center drive development property which was placed in service during the second quarter of  two office properties acquired in los angeles county in october of totaling approximately  square feet  an point overall occupancy gain in revenue from rental operations for the same store portfolio increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to the increase was due to an approximate million increase in scheduled cash rents  a million increase in other rental operations and a million increase in parking income  all of which were partially offset by an approximate million decrease in tenant reimbursements 
the increase in scheduled cash rents was primarily attributable to scheduled rent increases in existing leases and by the increase in average occupancy for these properties 
other rental operations increased primarily due to higher lease termination fees in and lower bad debt expense as a result of a reduced level of defaults in parking income increased in primarily due to an increase in occupancy in and higher special event parking 
tenant reimbursements decreased primarily due to the resetting of base years for new leases in property expenses property expenses increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december  compared to this increase was partially due to our acquisition and development activities  gains in occupancy and increases in operating expenses for the same property portfolio described below 
property expenses for the same store portfolio increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to an approximate million increase in repairs and maintenance  a million increase in real estate taxes and a million increase in property administrative expenses  all of which were partially offset by a million decrease in utilities expense and a million decrease in insurance expense 
the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was primarily due to higher costs for contracted services and the timing of certain projects 
the increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to the timing of reassessments and property tax refunds received in as well as new property tax measures implemented in los angeles county 
the increase in property administrative expense was primarily due to higher employee compensation costs and higher property legal expenses 
the decrease in utilities expense was primarily due to lower than anticipated usage in as a result of a mild summer  partially offset by an increase in occupancy 
the decrease in insurance expense was primarily due to lower premiums on a new insurance policy which began in march general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately million in as compared to this increase was primarily related to higher personnel costs associated with annual merit increases  non cash compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants issued in and and section implementation costs in interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million  or  in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a lower cost of debt in due to the refinancing of a million  secured loan with proceeds from property dispositions and from the issuance of million  effective rate unsecured senior notes in august  partially offset by lower capitalized interest in capitalized interest was lower in as we stopped capitalizing interest on our center drive development property in may 
table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to depreciation related to a property acquired in december  two properties acquired in october  a development property place in service in the second quarter of and depreciation related to capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions placed in service in and discontinued operations financial accounting standards no

therefore  in the table above  we have also presented the property operating results for our same property portfolio 
revenue from rental operations revenue from rental operations increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to our august acquisitions of a  square foot office property in los angeles county and four office properties in san diego county totaling approximately  square feet and a december acquisition of a  square foot office property in san diego county and the placement in service of our center drive development property in december of revenue from rental operations for the same store portfolio increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to the increase was due to an approximate million increase in scheduled cash rents  a million increase in tenant reimbursements and a million increased in parking income  all of which were partially offset by an approximate million decrease in straight line rents and a million decrease in other rental operations 
the increase in scheduled cash rents was primarily attributable to scheduled rent increases in existing leases that were partially offset by the decrease in average occupancy for these properties 
tenant reimbursement increased primarily due to recovery billings for higher operating expenses in as discussed below 
parking income increased primarily due to an increase in demand for monthly parking in in some of our buildings 
straight line rents decreased primarily due to the decline in occupancy and the scheduled reversal of straight line rents for certain older leases 
other rental operations decreased primarily due to decreases in lease termination settlements in property expenses property expenses increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december  compared to this increase was partially due our acquisition and development activities described above

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was primarily due to higher contractual costs for janitorial and other contract services as well as the timing of certain projects 
the increase in property administrative expense was primarily due to higher employee compensation costs  higher property legal expenses and costs associated with training programs implemented in the increase in insurance expense was due to increases in industry wide rates and premiums related to a million terrorism insurance policy entered into in the second quarter of real estate taxes decreased due to the timing of final reassessments of some properties in general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or  in as compared to this increase was primarily due to employee compensation costs  including employee separation costs in the current year and non cash compensation costs associated with annual restricted stock grants issued in as well as higher corporate governance costs in interest expense interest expense increased approximately million  or  in as compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in borrowings in the last half of for property acquisitions  lower interest capitalized in and costs associated with interest rate swaps entered into at the end of to fix

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million in as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to lower financing costs in as a result of a million loan and a million  preferred equity issuance that were refinanced at lower carrying costs 
in addition  our cash flow from operations was affected by the timing of our acquisitions and dispositions in although during we had net property sales  million of our million in dispositions occurred in december of cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million to million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to higher net selling activities in in  our cash flow used in investing activities was also affected by a higher level of tenant improvement and leasing commission expenditures as a result of approximately  square feet of additional leasing completed in over cash used in financing activities increased by approximately million to million in as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher net debt repayments in with proceeds generated from our capital recycling program 
cash balances and available borrowings as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash 
restricted cash consisted of million in interest bearing cash deposits required by four of our mortgage loans and million in cash impound accounts for real estate taxes and insurance as required by several of our mortgage loans 
through our operating partnership  we have access to a total of million under two unsecured lines of credit 
as of december   million was outstanding and million was available under these unsecured lines of credit 
capital recycling program under our capital recycling program  we evaluate our existing portfolio of properties and current market opportunities to determine if the sale or purchase of properties would improve the overall quality or return on invested capital of our existing portfolio 
proceeds from sales of properties may be used to pay down our borrowings until we identify attractive properties to purchase  renovate or develop 
during  we sold twelve properties totaling approximately million square feet for approximately million in gross sales proceeds

table of contents consolidated income available for debt service and compliance with principal financial covenants consolidated income available for debt service is a non gaap measurement of our performance and liquidity 
consolidated income available for debt service is presented below because this data is used by investors and our management as a supplemental measure to a evaluate our operating performance and compare it to other real estate companies  b determine trends in earnings  c determine our ability to service debt and d determine our ability to fund future capital expenditure requirements 
as discussed more fully below  consolidated income available for debt service is also used in several financial covenants we are required to satisfy each quarter under the terms of our principal debt agreements 
consolidated income available for debt service permits investors and management to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
by excluding interest expense  consolidated income available for debt service measures our operating performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and  therefore  allows for a more meaningful comparison of our operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare our operating performance to that of other companies  and to more readily identify and evaluate trends in earnings 
the usefulness of consolidated income available for debt service is limited because it does not reflect interest expense  taxes  gains or losses on sales of property  losses on valuations of derivatives  asset impairment losses  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  extraordinary items as defined by gaap and depreciation and amortization costs 
these costs have been or may in the future be incurred by us  each of which affects or could effect our operating performance and ability to finance our investments at competitive borrowing costs  successfully maintain our reit status  and acquire and dispose of real estate properties at favorable prices to us 
some of these costs also reflect changes in value in our properties that result from use or changes in market conditions and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties 
due to the significance of the net income components excluded from consolidated income available for debt service  this measure should not be considered an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with net income  cash flow from operations  and other performance or liquidity measures prescribed by gaap 
this measure should also be analyzed in conjunction with discussions elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the items eliminated in the calculation of consolidated income available for debt service 
the reader is cautioned that consolidated income available for debt service  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies under names such as or similar to consolidated income available for debt service  ebitda or adjusted ebitda that do not define this measure exactly the same as we do 

table of contents we calculate consolidated income available for debt service as follows year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities add interest expense interest expense from discontinued operations gain on repayment on mortgage note receivable less amortization of loan costs and fees straight line rent changes in operating assets and liabilities rent and other receivables deferred rent prepaid financing costs  expenses and other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses security deposits consolidated income available for debt service year ended december  net income add interest expense interest expense from discontinued operations depreciation and amortization minority interest minority interest from discontinued operations amortization of deferred compensation depreciation from discontinued operations impairment on investment in securities less gain on sale of discontinued properties gain on sale of operating properties straight line rent consolidated income available for debt service consolidated income available for debt service is also presented because it is used in ratios contained in the principal financial covenants of the indenture governing our publicly traded senior unsecured notes and our credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo 
as of december   our senior unsecured notes represented approximately of our total outstanding debt and amounts outstanding under our wells fargo unsecured line of credit represented approximately of our total outstanding debt 
the consolidated income available for debt service ratios and the other ratios reported below are part of financial covenants we are required to satisfy each fiscal quarter 
we believe information about these ratios is useful to 
table of contents confirm that we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our principal loan agreements  evaluate our ability to service our debt  evaluate our ability to fund future capital expenditures  and compare our ratios to other real estate companies  including other reits  that present the same ratios 
if we were to fail to satisfy these financial covenants  we would be in default under the terms of the indenture for the senior unsecured notes and or the wells fargo credit agreement 
a default under those agreements could accelerate the obligation to repay such debt and could cause us to be in default under our other debt agreements 
depending on the circumstances surrounding such acceleration  we might not be able to repay the debt on terms that are favorable to us  or at all  which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and our ability to raise capital in the future 
the reader is cautioned that these ratios  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to similarly entitled ratios reported by other companies that do not calculate these ratios exactly the same as we do 
these ratios should not be considered as alternatives to the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 
the following table summarizes the principal ratios contained in the financial covenants of our senior unsecured notes and wells fargo unsecured line of credit as of december  in thousands  except percentage and covenant ratio data net investment in real estate cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accumulated depreciation and amortization total assets total unencumbered assets mortgage loans payable unsecured lines of credit unsecured term loan unsecured senior notes  net of discount total outstanding debt consolidated income available for debt service interest incurred loan fee amortization debt service senior unsecured notes covenant ratios test actual ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service greater than total outstanding debt total assets less than secured debt total assets less than unencumbered assets unsecured debt greater than wells fargo unsecured line of credit covenant ratios test actual ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to interest expense greater than ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to fixed charges greater than represents secured loans that are secured by properties in our portfolio 
represents amounts for the most recent four consecutive quarters 
loan fee amortization excludes discount amortization on senior unsecured notes 
interest expense consists of interest expense plus capitalized interest and less amortization of loan fees and discounts 
fixed charges consist of interest costs  whether expensed or capitalized  principal payments on all debt  an amount equal to per quarter multiplied by the weighted average gross leasable square feet of the portfolio at the end of the period and preferred unit distributions 

table of contents future capital resources depending on market conditions  we may sell assets over the next twelve to twenty four months and it is difficult to predict the actual period and amount of these potential asset sales 
at the time of any such sales  depending on market conditions  sales proceeds may be placed into investments that we believe will generate higher long term value  which may include development or redevelopment of office buildings  acquisitions of existing buildings or repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  we expect to use a portion of any proceeds to pay down portions of our debt in order to maintain our conservative leverage and coverage ratios 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from our lines of credit or from asset sales 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  sales proceeds and short term borrowings  if necessary  will continue to be sufficient to pay any distributions necessary to enable us to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs over the next twelve months  including recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity and capital requirements such as scheduled principal repayments  development costs  property acquisitions  if any  and other non recurring capital expenditures through net cash provided by operations  refinancing of existing indebtedness  proceeds from asset sales and or the issuance of long term debt and equity securities 
recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures represent building improvements and leasing costs required to maintain current revenue 
recurring capital expenditures do not include immediate building improvements that were taken into consideration when underwriting the purchase of a building or which are being incurred to bring a building up to our operating standards or to reach stabilization 
we consider a property to be stabilized when the property is at least leased 
recurring capital expenditures consist primarily of replacement components such as new elevators  roof replacements and upgrade requirements required by new safety codes such as new fire life emergency systems 
non recurring capital expenditures represent improvement costs incurred to improve a property to our operating standards or reach stabilization 
these costs are normally taken into consideration during the underwriting process for a given property s acquisition 
non recurring capital expenditures include improvements such as new building expansion and renovation costs 
we capitalize both recurring capital expenditures and non recurring capital expenditures due to the probable benefit derived in future years from both non recurring as well as recurring capital expenditures 
contractual obligations as of december   we were subject to significant contractual payment obligations as described in the table below 
payments due by period total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations long term debt mortgage debt unsecured senior notes unsecured term loan unsecured line of credit ground leases operating leases capital commitments total contractual obligations excludes amortization of discount on unsecured senior notes 

table of contents funds from operations the following table reflects the calculation of our funds from operations for the years ended december     and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  in thousands  except ratio and per share amounts funds from operations net income depreciation and minority interest from discontinued operations gain on sale of discontinued properties depreciation and amortization gain on sale of operating properties minority interest income allocated to preferred operating partnership units funds from operations arden realty s percentage share arden realty s share of funds from operations weighted average common shares and operating partnership units outstanding diluted we believe that funds from operations  or ffo  is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  in april the white paper defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and the extraordinary items as defined by gaap  provides an additional perspective on our operating results 
however  because these excluded items have a real economic effect  ffo is a limited measure of performance 
ffo captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
ffo excludes depreciation and amortization costs and it does not capture the changes in value in our properties that result from use or changes in market conditions or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which are significant economic costs 
therefore  its ability to measure performance is limited 
because ffo excludes significant economic components of net income determined in accordance with gaap  ffo should be used as an adjunct to net income and not as an alternative to net income 
ffo should also not be used as an indicator of our financial performance  or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity 
ffo is not by itself indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or service our debt 
therefore  ffo only provides investors with an additional performance measure that when combined with measures computed in accordance with gaap such as net income  cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities provides investors with an indication of our ability to service debt and to fund acquisitions and other expenditures 
ffo is used by investors to compare our performance with other reits 
other reits may use different methods for calculating ffo and  accordingly  our ffo may not be comparable to other reits

table of contents current economic climate our short and long term liquidity  ability to refinance existing indebtedness  ability to issue long term debt and equity securities at favorable rates and our dividend policy are significantly impacted by the operating results of our properties  all of which are located in southern california 
our ability to lease available space and increase rates when leases expire is largely dependent on the demand for office space in the markets where our properties are located 
the timing and extent of future changes in the national and local economy and their effects on our properties and results of operations are difficult to accurately predict 
it is possible  however  that these national and regional issues may more directly affect us and our operating results in the future  making it more difficult for us to lease and renew available space  to increase or maintain rental rates as leases expire and to collect amounts due from our tenants 
for additional information  see risk factors lack of non farm job growth in southern california or a deterioration of the local and national economy will adversely affect our operating results  the financial condition and solvency of our tenants may reduce our cash flow  and rising energy costs and power outages in california may have an adverse effect on our operations and revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the exposure or loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
in order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations  we may use a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate hedges  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks such as counter party credit risk and legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
during  we entered into million of forward starting interest rate hedge agreements effectively fixing the year treasury rate at approximately for borrowings that are anticipated to occur in to refinance some of our scheduled debt maturities 
in october and november of  we also entered into reverse interest rate hedge agreements to float million of the fixed interest rate associated with the senior unsecured notes due in november under these reverse hedges  we will receive interest at a fixed rate of and pay interest at a variable rate averaging the six month libor in arrears plus 
some of our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates of interest  such as libor 
based on interest rates and outstanding balances as of december   a increase in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt  including million in fixed rate debt swapped to floating through interest rate hedges  would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
a decrease in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
the weighted average interest rate on our floating debt as of december  was 
our fixed rate debt  including million in floating rate debt swapped to fixed through interest rate hedges  totaled  million as of december  with a weighted average interest rate of and a total fair value of approximately  million 
a decrease in interest rates on our  million of fixed rate debt would increase its fair value by approximately million and would not have an impact on annual future earnings and cash flows 
a increase in interest rates on our  million of fixed rate debt would decrease its fair value by approximately million and would not have an impact of annual future earnings and cash flows 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  we would consider taking 
table of contents actions to further mitigate our exposure to any such change 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  however  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this form k  readers should carefully consider the following risk factors 
real estate investment risks an inability to retain tenants or rent space upon lease expirations may adversely affect our revenues and our ability to service our debt 
through   leases  including month to month leases  comprising approximately of our leased net rentable square footage and approximately of our annualized base rents at december  are scheduled to expire as follows percentage of percentage of aggregate portfolio aggregate portfolio number of leased square annualized base year leases expiring feet rent if we are unable to promptly renew or relet leases for all or a substantial portion of this space  or if the rent upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected  our cash flow and business could be adversely affected which would limit our ability to service our debt 
lack of non farm job growth in southern california or a deterioration of the local and national economy will adversely affect our operating results 
all of our properties are located in southern california 
in  the southern california economy experienced a increase in job growth representing approximately  non farm jobs 
we believe non farm job growth to be a leading indicator of office demand for the region 
during  a total of approximately million square feet of occupied space  representing approximately of our total net rentable space  including month to month leases  will expire 
negative non farm job growth in our submarkets or a deterioration of the local and or national economy may result in a decline in occupancy and rental rates and may cause tenant concessions to increase and would most likely negatively affect our operating performance and property values 
competition affects occupancy levels  rents and cost of land which could adversely affect our revenues 
many office properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
some of the competing properties may be newer  better located or owned by parties better capitalized than we are 
although ownership of these competing properties is currently diversified among many different types of owners  from publicly traded companies and institutional investors to small enterprises and individual owners  and no one or group of owners currently dominate or significantly influence the market  consolidation of owners could create efficiencies and marketing advantages for the consolidated group that could adversely affect us 
these competitive advantages  the number of competitors and the number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the rents we can charge  our ability to lease space in our existing properties or at newly acquired or developed properties and the prices we have to pay for developable land 

table of contents the financial condition and solvency of our tenants may reduce our cash flow 
tenants may experience a downturn in their business which may cause them to miss rental payments when due or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  which could result in rejection and termination of their leases or a delay in recovering possession of their premises 
although we have not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies  we cannot assure you that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
that illiquidity may tend to limit our ability to sell properties promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended  may under specified circumstances impose a prohibited transaction tax on the profits derived from our sale of properties held for fewer than four years  which could affect our ability to sell our properties 
rising energy costs and power outages in california may have an adverse effect on our operations and revenue 
problems associated with deregulation of the electric industry in california have resulted in significantly higher costs in some areas 
all of our properties are currently located in areas served by utilities that either produce their own electricity  or that have procured long term  fixed rate contracts with commercial electrical providers 
while we have no information suggesting that any future service interruptions are expected  we believe that higher utility costs may continue as price increases are allowed by the california public utility commission or other regulatory agencies 
approximately of our buildings and of the total rentable square footage of our portfolio are subject to leases that require our tenants to pay all utility costs 
the remainder of our leases provide that tenants will reimburse us for utility costs in excess of a base year amount 
although we have not experienced any material losses resulting from electric deregulation  it is possible that some or all of our tenants will not fulfill their lease obligations and reimburse us for their share of any significant electric rate increases and that we will not be able to retain or replace our tenants if energy problems in california continue 
increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our revenue 
except for our triple net leases  we may not be able to pass all real estate tax increases through to some or all of our tenants 
therefore  any tax increases may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations 
our properties are also subject to various federal  california and local regulatory requirements  such as requirements of the americans with disabilities act  and california and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with these regulatory requirements 
we cannot assure you  however  that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed that would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our cash flow  the amounts available for distributions and on our business 
we may acquire properties through partnerships or joint ventures with third parties that could result in financial dependency and management conflicts 
we may participate with other entities in property ownership through joint ventures or partnerships in the future 
depending on the characteristics and business objectives of the joint venture or partnership  we may 
table of contents not have voting control over the joint venture or partnership 
partnership or joint venture investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not otherwise present  including our partners or co venturers might become bankrupt  our partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and our partners or co venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests contrary to our policies or objectives 
neither the partnership agreement of our operating partnership nor our governing documents prevent us from participating in joint ventures with our affiliates 
because a joint venture with an affiliate may not be negotiated in a traditional arm s length transaction  terms of the joint venture may not be as favorable to us as we could obtain if we entered into a joint venture with an outside third party 
we may not be able to successfully integrate or finance our acquisitions 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including building systems not operating as expected  delay in or failure to lease vacant space and tenants failing to renew leases as they expire 
in addition  our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing accounting systems and property management structure 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed with that integration or effectively manage additional properties or that newly acquired properties will perform as expected 
changing market conditions  including competition from other purchasers of suburban office properties  may diminish our opportunities for attractive additional acquisitions 
moreover  acquisition costs of a property may exceed original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical 
our acquisitions and renovations may not perform as expected 
although we currently have no plans to significantly expand or renovate our properties  we may do so in the future 
expansion and renovation projects may inconvenience and displace existing tenants  require us to engage in time consuming up front planning and engineering activities and expend capital  and require us to obtain various government and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
while our policies with respect to expansion and renovation activities are intended to limit some of the risks otherwise associated with these activities  we will nevertheless incur risks  including expenditures of funds on  and devotion of our time to  projects that may not be completed 
our development activities may be more expensive than anticipated and may not yield our anticipated results 
we have preliminary architectural designs completed for an additional  net rentable square feet at the howard hughes center in los angeles  california and have completed preliminary designs on a build to suit office building at our long beach airport business park 
we have entitlements for up to hotel rooms at the howard hughes center 
we also have a acre developable land parcel in torrance  california that we are also marketing for a build to suit building 
we do not intend to commence construction on any of these projects until development plans and budgets are finalized and build to suit tenant leases are signed with terms allowing us to achieve yields commensurate with each project s development risk 
we also intend to review  from time to time  other opportunities for developing and constructing office buildings and other commercial properties in accordance with our development and underwriting policies 
we expect to finance our development activities over the next months through net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset sales  proceeds from our lines of credit or other secured borrowings 
risks associated with our development activities may include abandonment of development opportunities due to a lack of financing or other reasons  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical  
table of contents occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs  and development activities would also be subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
we are not subject to any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any single property or any single geographic area 
our governing documents do not restrict the amount or percentage of our assets that we may invest in a single property or geographic area 
all of our properties are currently in southern california and we have no immediate plans to invest outside of southern california 
although the overall southern california economy is diverse and well balanced  the geographic concentration of our portfolio may make us more susceptible to changes affecting the southern california economy and real estate markets or damages from regional events such as earthquakes 
we may not be able to expand into new markets successfully 
while our business is currently limited to the southern california market  it is possible that we will in the future expand our business to new geographic markets 
we will not initially possess the same level of familiarity with new markets outside of southern california  which could adversely affect our ability to manage  lease  develop or acquire properties in new localities 
financing risks our amount of debt could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   we had total debt of approximately billion  consisting of approximately million in secured debt and approximately million of unsecured debt 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund distributions  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisition and development activity and other business purposes  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  limit our ability to refinance our debt and obtain additional debt financing  and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and real estate industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the real estate industry 
despite current indebtedness levels  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future  which would increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
neither the partnership agreement of our operating partnership nor our governing documents limit the amount or the percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
we may borrow up to a maximum of million under our two lines of credit 
as of december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under these two lines of credit 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify and could increase the risk of default on our indebtedness 
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 
our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest when due 
in addition  we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness  which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity  and  if we can refinance  the terms of the refinancing might not be as favorable 
table of contents as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
as of march   approximately million of principal will be coming due over the next eighteen months 
if principal payments cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt and continue to service and repay our debt obligations 
rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition 
an increase in prevailing interest rates would have an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates 
at december   approximately of our debt was variable rate debt 
increases in interest rates would also impact the refinancing of our fixed rate debt 
if interest rates are higher when our fixed debt becomes due  we may be forced to borrow at the higher rates 
if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates  the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our debt 
as a protection against rising interest rates  we may enter into agreements such as interest rate hedges  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
these agreements  however  increase our risks as to the other parties to the agreements not performing or that the agreements could be unenforceable 
during  we entered into million of forward starting interest rate hedge agreements effectively fixing the year treasury rate at approximately for borrowings that are anticipated to occur in to refinance some of our scheduled debt maturities 
in october and november of  we also entered into reverse interest rate hedge agreements to float million of the fixed interest rate associated with the senior unsecured notes due in november under these reverse hedges  we will receive interest at a fixed rate of and pay interest at a variable rate averaging the six month libor in arrears plus 
many of our properties are subject to mortgage financing which could result in foreclosure if we are unable to pay or refinance the mortgages when due 
we currently have outstanding four mortgage financings totaling approximately million that are secured by of our properties 
the properties in each of these financings are fully cross collateralized and cross defaulted 
to the extent two or more mortgages are cross defaulted  a default in one mortgage will trigger a default in the other mortgages 
the cross defaults can give the lender a number of remedies depending on the circumstances such as the right to increase the interest rate  demand additional collateral  accelerate the maturity date of the mortgages or foreclose on and sell the properties 
to the extent two or more mortgages are cross collateralized  a default in one mortgage will allow the mortgage lender to foreclose upon and sell the properties that are not the primary collateral for the loan in default 
four additional properties are subject to single property mortgages totaling approximately million at december  if we are unable to meet our obligations under these mortgages  we could be forced to pay higher interest rates or provide additional collateral or the properties subject to the mortgages could be foreclosed upon and sold  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations 
tax risks our desire to qualify as a reit restricts our ability to accumulate cash that might be used in future periods to make debt payments or to fund future growth 
in order to qualify as a reit and avoid federal income tax liability  we must distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income  excluding net capital gain  and to avoid income taxation  our distributions must not be less than of our net taxable income  including capital gains 
to avoid excise tax liability  our distributions to our stockholders for the year must exceed the sum of of its ordinary income  of its capital gain net income  and any undistributed taxable income from prior years 
as a result of these distribution requirements  we do not expect to accumulate significant amounts of cash 
accordingly  these distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on our debt obligations and to fund future growth 

table of contents our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that it will qualify 
our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
however  if the operating partnership were a publicly traded partnership  it would be treated as a corporation instead of a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless at least of its income is qualifying income as defined in the internal revenue code 
the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this test are similar in most respects 
qualifying income for the test generally includes passive income  such as specified types of real property rents  dividends and interest 
we believe that the operating partnership would meet this test  but we cannot guarantee that it would 
if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation  it would incur substantial tax liabilities and we would fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we may suffer adverse tax consequences and be unable to attract capital if we fail to qualify as a reit 
we believe that since our taxable year ended december   we have been organized and operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
although we believe that we have been and will continue to be organized and have operated and will continue to operate so as to qualify for taxation as a reit  we cannot assure you that we have been or will continue to be organized or operated in a manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified 
for us to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and tests regarding various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit  like us  that holds its assets through an investment in a partnership 
no assurance can be given that legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of qualification 
we are  however  not aware of any pending legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  asset diversification  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code  the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by our tax counsel 
if we failed to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
if we were disqualified as a reit  our ability to raise additional capital could be significantly impaired 
this could reduce the funds we would have available to pay distributions to our stockholders and to service our debt 
even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  if we have net income from a prohibited transaction  specifically sales or other taxable dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  that income will be subject to a tax 
other risks we are subject to agreements and policies that may deter change in control offers that might be attractive to our stockholders 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay  defer or prevent a third party from making offers to acquire us or assume control over us 
for example  such provisions may deter tender offers for our common stock  which offers may be attractive to the stockholders  and deter purchases of large blocks of common stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock over then prevailing market prices 

table of contents our charter contains a provision designed to prevent a concentration of ownership among our stockholders that would cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
under the internal revenue code  not more than in value of our outstanding shares of common stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals  including specific kinds of entities  at any time during the last half of our taxable year 
in addition  if we  or an owner of or more of our common stock  actually or constructively owns or more of a tenant of ours  or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner  the rent received by us from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
in order to protect us against the risk of losing reit status  the ownership limit included in our charter limits actual or constructive ownership of our outstanding shares of common stock by any single stockholder to  by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the then outstanding shares of common stock 
actual or constructive ownership of shares of common stock in excess of the ownership limit will cause the violative transfer or ownership to be void with respect to the transferee or owner as to that number of shares in excess of the ownership limit and such shares will be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations 
that transferee or owner will have no right to vote such shares or be entitled to dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares 
although our board of directors presently has no intention of doing so  except as described below  our board of directors could waive this restriction with respect to a particular stockholder if it were satisfied  based upon the advice of counsel or a ruling from the internal revenue service  that ownership by such stockholder in excess of the ownership limit would not jeopardize our status as a reit and our board of directors otherwise decided such action would be in our best interests 
our board of directors has waived our ownership limit with respect to mr 
ziman  our chairman and ceo  and certain family members and affiliates and has permitted these parties to actually and constructively own up to of the outstanding shares of common stock 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to cause us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or classify any unissued and reclassify any previously classified but unissued shares of preferred stock and  with respect to the preferred stock  to set the preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares 
although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time  it could establish a series of preferred stock that could  depending on the terms of such series  delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors of each class are chosen for three year terms upon the expiration of their current terms and each year one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders 
the staggered terms of directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
losses in excess of our insurance coverage or uninsured losses could adversely affect our cash flow 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage  terrorism and rental loss insurance policies which currently cover all of our properties with specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances 
some losses  however  are generally not insured against because it is not economically feasible to do so 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose our capital invested in the property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and  in the case of debt which is recourse to us  we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss would adversely affect our cash flow with respect to the property subject to the loss 
moreover  we would generally be liable for any unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations with respect to the property subject to the loss 
lack of availability of insurance coverage for biological  chemical or nuclear terrorist attacks could adversely affect our financial condition 
our current terrorism insurance policy  which has been extended to march subject to the continuation of the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  specifically excludes biological  chemical 
table of contents or nuclear terrorist acts 
we have been notified by our insurance broker that in the aftermath of the september th attacks  insurance carriers will continue to exclude these types of attacks from terrorism insurance policies or offer coverage for biological  chemical or nuclear attacks coverages at prohibitive costs 
although we did not derive more than of our net operating income from any one of the properties in our portfolio  a biological  chemical or nuclear terrorist attack damaging several of our properties or negatively impacting the financial condition of our tenants could materially deteriorate our operating results and overall financial condition 
an earthquake could adversely affect our business 
all of our properties are located in southern california which is a high risk geographical area for earthquakes 
depending upon its magnitude  an earthquake could severely damage our properties which would adversely affect our business 
we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties and the resulting business interruption 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient if there is a major earthquake 
our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants  and the liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
these costs may be substantial  and the presence of these substances  or the failure to remediate the contamination on the property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow against the property 
finally  third parties may have claims against the owner of the site based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
specific federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose liability for release of asbestos containing material and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos containing materials 
in connection with the ownership and operation of our properties  we may be potentially liable for those costs 
in the past few years  independent environmental consultants have conducted or updated phase i environmental assessments and other environmental investigations as appropriate at some of our properties 
the environmental site assessments and investigations have identified properties in our portfolio  representing approximately of the total rentable square feet in the portfolio  affected by environmental concerns 
these environmental concerns include properties that may be impacted by known or suspected a contamination caused by third party sources or b soil and or groundwater contamination which has been remediated  and c those containing underground storage tanks or asbestos 
of these properties  two are believed to be affected by contamination caused by third party sources and also house an underground storage tank  two contain friable asbestos  twenty three contain non friable asbestos  and eight house underground storage tanks only 
the properties affected by contamination are primarily affected by petroleum and solvent substances  and in each case a third party has indemnified us for any and all problems associated with this contamination 
with regard to those properties affected by asbestos  asbestos does not pose a health hazard if it is not disturbed in such a way to cause an airborne release of asbestos 
asbestos is friable when it can be crumbled  pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure  and non friable when hand pressure cannot release encapsulated asbestos fibers 
friable asbestos is more likely to be released into the air than non friable asbestos 
we manage all asbestos in ways that minimize its potential to become airborne or otherwise threaten human health 
regarding underground storage tanks  subsurface leakage of the materials contained within the tank constitutes the primary risk posed by these devices
