item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we manufacture  market  distribute and sell natural  organic  specialty and snack food products and natural personal care products under brand names which are sold as better for you products 
our products are sold primarily to specialty and natural food distributors and are marketed nationally to supermarkets  natural food stores  and other retail classes of trade including mass market stores  drug stores  food service channels and club stores 
we made the following acquisitions during the three years ended june  o on april   we acquired zia cosmetics  inc  including the zia r natural skincare brand  a respected leader in therapeutic products for healthy  beautiful skin sold mainly through natural food retailers 
o on june   we acquired jason natural products  inc  a california based manufacturer and marketer of natural personal care products

o on may   we acquired grains noirs  nv  a belgian producer and marketer of fresh prepared organic appetizers  salads  sandwiches and other full plated dishes 
o on december   we acquired the assets and brands of imagine foods  inc imagine in the united states and the united kingdom 
imagine is a non dairy beverage brand specializing in aseptic and refrigerated rice and soymilks  organic aseptic soups and broths  and organic non dairy frozen desserts under the rice dream r  soy dream r and imagine r brands 
all of the foregoing acquisitions the acquisitions or acquired brands have been accounted for as purchases 
consequently  the operations of the acquired brands are included in our results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
on june   we sold our kineret r and kosherific r brands  which marketed and distributed a line of frozen and dry kosher food products 
we acquired these brands in fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies  however  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have consistently applied 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized when the earnings process is complete  which occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements  title and risk of loss transfer to customers  collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable 
sales are reported net of sales incentives  which include trade discounts and promotions and certain coupon costs 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in reported sales 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations over the last few years 
while one of our customers represented approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken to be repaid and collectible in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred  however  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our chargebacks receivable by million 
as the result of our continuing focus on the monitoring of unauthorized deductions and successful collection efforts  our chargebacks receivable balance approximated only million at june   significantly lower than the million at june  there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of actual  cost or market  utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and provide for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment exists by analyzing underlying cash flow projections 
at this time  we believe no impairment exists on the carrying value of such assets 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
intangibles goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset is amortized over its useful life unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
the carrying value of goodwill  which is allocated to the company s five reporting units  and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment 
in connection with its monitoring role  the staff of the division of corporation finance of the securities and exchange commission reviewed and commented on the company s form k for the year ended june  and certain quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k 
while most of the staff s comments have been resolved  the staff has questioned the number of reporting units identified by the company 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units and is tested annually for impairment 
the company and its independent registered public accounting firm believe that the company s determination of reporting units is appropriate and that such determination is consistent with the manner in which the company s business is managed  and that this determination conforms with the applicable accounting requirements  however  the staff may disagree 
if it was ultimately determined that the number of reporting units is to be greater than that identified by the company which totals five  goodwill would be allocated and tested for impairment across a different configuration of reporting units than currently utilized  which could result in the company recognizing an impairment of goodwill that it would not otherwise recognize 
segments sfas no 
defines an operating segment as that component of an enterprise i that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses  ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance  and iii for which discrete financial information is available 
sfas no 
defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the company has determined that it operates in one segment  the sale of natural and organic products  including food  beverage and personal care products  and further that such single segment includes five reporting units in the annual test of goodwill for impairment 
characteristics of the company s operations which are relied on in making these determinations include the similarities apparent in the company s products in the natural and organic consumer markets  the commonality of the company s customers across brands  the company s unified marketing strategy  and the nature of the financial information used by the codm  described below  other than information on sales and direct product costs  by brand 
the company s five reporting units are grocery including snacks  tea  personal care  canada  and europe 
the company has further determined that its chairman of the board and chief executive officer is the company s codm as defined in sfas no 
 and is also the manager of the company s single segment 
in making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment  the company s codm focuses on sales performance by brand using internally generated sales data as well as externally developed market consumption data acquired from independent sources  and further reviews certain data regarding standard costs and standard gross margins by brand 
in making these decisions  the codm receives and reviews certain company consolidated quarterly and year to date information  however  the codm does not receive or review any discrete financial information by geographic location  business unit  subsidiary  division or brand 
the codm reviews and approves capital spending on a company consolidated basis rather than at any lower unit level 
the company s board of directors receives the same quarterly and year to date information as the company s codm 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in were million  an increase of million or over net sales of million in the increase came from volume increases  the phasing in of price increases and from sales generated by brands acquired in  with increases offset by reduced sales due to the elimination of our carbfit r brand  which experienced strong sales during the prior year  before the decline in consumer demand for low carbohydrate products 
we experienced strong brand sales gains for terra chips r  which was up  garden of eatin r  which was up  earth s best r  which was up  imagine r soups  which was up  and to a lesser extent increased sales of celestial seasoning r teas  which was up 
sales of our brands in europe increased gross profit in was of net sales as compared to of net sales in the decline in gross profit percentage was principally the result of a million charge for our stock keeping unit sku rationalization program  which had the effect of reducing gross profit by percentage points 
after considering the effect of the sku rationalization  our margins remained relatively flat as a result of the price increases we phased in begin ning july  and june   which provided us with an almost equal offset to increases in ingredient and other input costs  increases in transportation costs resulting from higher fuel costs  the cost effects of new regulations on the us trucking industry in effect for the full fiscal year  an increase in the percentage of our shipments that are delivered by us  which has stabilized since we first experienced such increases in our third quarter of fiscal  and a change in the mix of products sold whereby our higher margin tea sales became a lower proportion of our consolidated sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in such expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to in as compared with in selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in overall dollars  primarily as a result of costs brought on by brands acquired in  increased consumer marketing expenses needed to support our increased sales as well as increases across all levels of general and administrative expenses to support our growing business 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  includes approximately million for the sku rationalization program and approximately million of outside professional costs for sarbanes oxley compliance 
non cash compensation expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the increase in non cash compensation expenses primarily relate to the accelerated vesting of employee stock options in june  when our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options held by employees 
this action was taken in order to reduce future compensation charges for these stock options and to provide an incentive to employees in view of the uncertainty of future equity based compensation with the pending implementation of sfas no 
r 
as a result of this action  approximately million outstanding unvested stock options were accelerated approximately  of which were at exercise prices greater than market price at the date of acceleration  substantially all of which were granted in august at an exercise price of per share with original vesting through august we recognized a charge to earnings for the difference between the market value of our stock on the date of acceleration and the exercise price of the options  such charge amounting to approximately million million net of tax for the year ended june  as a result of this action  there will be no stock option amortization expense in future periods unless additional stock options are granted 
operating income was million or in compared to million or in the decline in operating income was the result of the aggregate of million of charges from sku rationalization and the acceleration of vesting of stock options 
after considering the effect of such million of charges  operating income was million in  representing a increase over this increase results principally from higher sales coupled by stable margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales interest and other expenses  net  amounted to million in compared to million in our interest expense was million higher in as compared to  principally as a result of the higher interest rates on higher average borrowings we carried this year after our recent acquisitions 
we had million in net currency exchange gains in the current year as compared to less than million in net currency exchange losses in the prior year  which partially offset the additional interest costs 
income before income taxes in amounted to million compared to million in this decrease is attributable to the aforementioned decrease in operating income and increase in interest and other expenses  net 
after considering the effect of the aggregate of million of charges from sku rationalization and the acceleration of vesting of stock options  income before income taxes was million representing an increase of million  or over the prior year 
this increase results principally from higher sales coupled by stable margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
our effective income tax rate approximated of pre tax income for compared to for this decrease was attributable to a million reduction in tax liabilities resulting from the termination of certain outstanding tax matters and is equal to the amount charged against the company s earnings when these arose in prior years 
net income in amounted to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the decrease of million in net income was primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in income before income taxes offset by the decrease in our effective tax rate 
during  we initiated a program to focus on our operating free cash flow and cash conversion cycle 
we define operating free cash flow as cash provided from operating activities less capital expenditures 
during  our operating free cash flow was million as compared to million in  representing an increase of 
our cash conversion cycle  which is a measure of the number of days needed to convert operating activities into cash  was reduced to days in from the days of the prior year  an improvement of days  or 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in were million  an increase of million or over net sales of million in the increase in sales came from volume increases principally in our snacks brands  which were up  our earth s best baby food brand  which was up  our celestial seasonings tea brand  which was up  and from the introduction of our new carb fit brand of low carbohydrate products  as well as sales of brands acquired in and a full year of our operation of brands acquired in we believe that sales growth during the period was negatively impacted by our inability to fill orders for soup due to non recurring manufacturing issues encountered at our independent soup co packer  thereby causing out of stock positions on soup and  to a lesser extent  by the strike during our second and third quarters of fiscal of grocery workers in southern california where we have a very strong market presence 
gross profit in was of net sales as compared to of net sales in the decline in gross profit percentage was principally the result of the aggressive spending in the trade and with consumers  including spending on the launch of carb fit  as well as increases in transportation costs resulting from higher fuel costs  the cost effects of new regulations on the us trucking industry  and an increase in the percentage of our shipments that were delivered by us 
we also saw increases in the cost of ingredients 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in such expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to in as compared with in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in overall dollars and as a percentage of sales  primarily as a result of million of additional costs associated with brands acquired in as well as the full year of operations of brands acquired in  million of increased consumer marketing to support our increased sales  including our new carb fit line of products  million of added costs relating to the implementation of required provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  and increased costs relating to the management changes that have been made during the second half of our fiscal year 
there were no restructuring and other non recurring charges in during  we recorded approximately million of additional restructuring and other non recurring charges related to the sale of our health valley facility for severance liabilities and related employee costs and trade items that could not be accrued in in addition  at the time of lease termination in  we were able to reduce our potential lease exit costs by million  which was recorded as a credit to restructuring and other non recurring charges in operating income was million in compared to million in operating income as a percentage of net sales was in  compared with in these changes are a result of higher sales offset by the aforementioned decrease in gross profit and increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest and other expenses  net  amounted to million in compared to million in we incurred higher interest expense in resulting from borrowings for acquisitions which were outstanding for the full year in as compared to only part of the year in income before income taxes in amounted to million compared to million in this decrease is attributable to the aforementioned decrease in operating income and increase in interest and other expenses  net 
income taxes in amounted to million compared to million in our effective tax rate was in and net income in amounted to million compared to million in the decrease of million in net income was primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings under our credit facility 
on april   we entered into a new million credit facility the credit facility with a bank group led by our existing bank agents for a five year term expiring in april the credit facility provides for an uncommitted million accordion feature  under which the facility may be increased to million 
the credit facility is secured only by a pledge of shares of certain of our foreign subsidiaries and is guaranteed by all of our current and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
we are required to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of this nature 
revolving credit loans under this facility bear interest at a base rate greater of the applicable prime rate or federal funds rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  the reserve adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin 
as of june    million was borrowed under the credit facility at an average interest rate of 
this access to capital provides us with flexible working capital needs in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business through acquisitions or develop our existing infrastructure through capital investment 
net cash provided by operations was million and million for and  respectively 
our working capital and current ratio were million and to  respectively  at june  compared with million and to respectively  at june  our improvement in cash provided by operations was the result of higher sales and stable margins while incurring non cash sku rationalization and non cash compensation charges 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million for and million for during and  we borrowed cash to fund acquisitions made during each year 
during  we received million of proceeds on the exercise of stock options and warrants and we acquired  shares of our common stock in open market purchases at a cost of approximately million

such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  the following o general economic and business conditions  o the ability of the company to implement its business and acquisition strategy  o the ability to effectively integrate its acquisitions  o the ability of the company to obtain financing for general corporate purposes  o competition  o availability of key personnel  and o changes in  or the failure to comply with government regulations 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  no assurance can be given as to the future results  levels of activity and achievements and neither the company nor any person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements 
our acquisition strategy exposes us to risk we intend to continue to grow our business in part through the acquisition of new brands  both in the united states and internationally 
our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring brands with products that complement our existing product mix 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to o successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  o negotiate identified acquisitions on terms acceptable to us  or o obtain the necessary financing to complete such acquisitions 
we may encounter increased competition for acquisitions in the future  which could result in acquisition prices we do not consider acceptable 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
our future success may be dependent on our ability to integrate companies that we acquire our future success may be dependent upon our ability to effectively integrate new brands that we acquire  including our ability to realize potentially available marketing opportunities and cost savings  some of which may involve operational changes 
we cannot be certain o as to the timing or number of marketing opportunities or amount of cost savings that may be realized as the result of our integration of an acquired brand  o that a business combination will enhance our competitive position and business prospects  o that we will not experience difficulties with customers  personnel or other parties as a result of a business combination  or o that  with respect to our acquisitions outside the united states  we will not be affected by  among other things  exchange rate risk 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in o integrating an acquired brand s distribution channels with our own  o coordinating sales force activities of an acquired company or in selling the products of an acquired company to our customer base  or o integrating an acquired company into our management information systems or in integrating an acquired company s products into our product mix 
additionally  integrating an acquired company into our existing operations will require management resources and may divert our management from our day to day operations 
if we are not successful in integrating the operations of acquired companies  our business could be harmed 
consumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change a significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or our failure to maintain our current market position could reduce our sales or the prestige of our brands in our markets  which could harm our business 
while we continue to diversify our product offerings  we cannot be certain that demand for our products will continue at current levels or increase in the future 
our business is primarily focused on sales of natural and organic products in markets geared to consumers of natural foods  specialty teas  non dairy beverages  cereals  breakfast bars  canned soups and vegetables  snacks and cooking oils  which  if consumer demand for such categories were to decrease  could harm our business 
consumer trends change based on a number of possible factors  including o nutritional values  such as a change in preference from fat free to reduced fat to no reduction in fat  and o a shift in preference from organic to non organic and from natural products to non natural products 
in addition  we have other product categories  such as medically directed food products  kosher foods and other specialty food items  as well as natural health and beauty care products 
we are subject to evolving consumer preferences for these products 
our markets are highly competitive we operate in highly competitive geographic and product markets  and some of our markets are dominated by competitors with greater resources 
we cannot be certain that we could successfully compete for sales to distributors or stores that purchase from larger  more established companies that have greater financial  managerial  sales and technical resources 
in addition  we compete for limited retailer shelf space for our products 
larger competitors  such as mainstream food companies including general mills  nestle sa  kraft foods  groupe danone  kellogg company and sara lee corporation  also may be able to benefit from economies of scale  pricing advantages or the in troduction of new products that compete with our products 
retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels 
the beverage market is large and highly competitive 
the tea portion of the beverage market is also highly competitive 
competitive factors in the tea industry include product quality and taste  brand awareness among consumers  variety of specialty tea flavors  interesting or unique product names  product packaging and package design  supermarket and grocery store shelf space  alternative distribution channels  reputation  price  advertising and promotion 
our principal competitors on a national basis in the specialty tea market are thomas j 
lipton company  a division of unilever plc  and rc bigelow  inc unilever has substantially greater financial resources than us 
in addition  in april  tazo tea company a subsidiary of starbucks corporation and kraft foods global  inc announced a licensing agreement whereby tazo products might gain additional access to grocery channels through placement by kraft  which has substantially greater financial resources than we do 
additional competitors include a number of regional specialty tea companies 
there may be potential entrants which are not currently in the specialty tea market who may have substantially greater resources than we have 
private label competition in the specialty tea category is currently minimal  but growing 
in the future  competitors may introduce other products that compete with our products and these competitive products may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent upon the services of our chief executive officer we are highly dependent upon the services of irwin d 
simon  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
we believe mr 
simon s reputation as our founder and his expertise and knowledge in the natural and organic products market are critical factors in our continuing growth 
the loss of the services of mr 
simon could harm our business 
we rely on independent brokers and distributors for a substantial portion of our sales we rely upon sales efforts made by or through non affiliated food brokers to distributors and other customers 
the loss of  or business disruption at  one or more of these distributors or brokers may harm our business 
if we were required to obtain additional or alternative distribution and food brokerage agreements or arrangements in the future  we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
in fiscal  one of our distributors  united natural foods  inc  accounted for approximately of our net sales 
two of our distributors  united natural foods  inc and tree of life  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales for the fiscal year ended june   and approximately and  respectively  for the year ended june  our inability to enter into satisfactory brokerage agreements may inhibit our ability to implement our business plan or to establish markets necessary to develop our products successfully 
food brokers act as selling agents representing specific brands on a non exclusive basis under oral or written agreements generally terminable at any time on days notice  and receive a percentage of net sales as compensation 
distributors purchase directly for their own account for resale 
in addition  the success of our business depends  in large part  upon the establishment and maintenance of a strong distribution network 
loss of one or more of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business for the years ended june   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at our manufacturing facilities 
an interruption in or the loss of operations at one or more of these facilities  or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities  could delay or postpone production of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition until we could secure an alternate source of supply 
we rely on independent co packers to produce some or most of our products during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at independent co packers 
in the us  we presently obtain o all of our requirements for non dairy beverages from five co packers  all of which are under contract or other arrangements  o all of our us requirements for rice cakes from one co packer  o all of our health valley r baked goods and cereal products from one co packer  which is under contract  o all of our cooking oils from one co packer  o principally all of our garden of eatin r and little bear organic foods r tortilla chips from three co packers  one of which is under contract  o a portion of our requirements for terra r yukon gold  red blisstm  terra bluestm  and potpourri tm potato chips and fritestm line from one co packer  which is under contract  o the requirements for our canned soups from four co packers  which are under contract  o all of our earth s best r baby food products from seven co packers  which are under contract  and o a portion of our ethnic gourmet r products from one co packer  which is under contract  and o all of our zia r natural skincare products from four co packers  which are under contract or other arrangements 
the loss of one or more co packers  or our failure to retain co packers for newly acquired products or brands  could delay or postpone production of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition until such time as an alternate source could be secured  which may be on less favorable terms 
our tea ingredients are subject to import risk our tea brand purchases its ingredients from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers  importers and growers  with the majority of those purchases occurring outside of the united states 
we maintain long term relationships with most of our suppliers 
purchase arrangements with ingredient suppliers are generally made annually and in us currency 
purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts  and price  delivery terms and product specifications vary 
our botanical purchasers visit major suppliers around the world annually to procure ingredients and to assure quality by observing production methods and providing product specifications 
many ingredients are presently grown in countries where labor intensive cultivation is possible  and where we often must educate the growers about product standards 
we perform laboratory analysis on incoming ingredient shipments for the purpose of assuring that they meet our quality standards and those of the fda and the california organic foods act of our ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control  such as foreign political situations  embargoes  changes in national and world economic conditions  currency fluctuations forecasting adequate need of seasonal raw material ingredients and unfavorable climatic conditions 
we take steps and will continue to take steps intended to lessen the risk of an interruption of botanical supplies  including identification of alternative sources and maintenance of appropriate inventory levels 
we have  in the past  maintained sufficient supplies for our ongoing operations 
our failure to maintain relationships with our existing suppliers or find new suppliers  observe production standards for our foreign procured products or continue our supply of botanicals from foreign sources could harm our business 
our future results of operations may be adversely affected by escalating fuel costs 
many aspects of our business have been  and continue to be  directly affected by the continuously rising cost of fuel 
increased fuel costs have translated into increased costs for the products and services we receive from our third party providers including  but not limited to  increased production and distribution costs for our products 
as the cost of doing business increases  we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers and  therefore  any such increase may adversely affect our earnings 
we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations  including foreign currency risks operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
these changes  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and in we expect sales from non core us markets to possibly represent an increasing portion of our total net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including o periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  o price and currency exchange controls  o fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  o unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  o compliance with applicable foreign laws  and o difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors 
our inability to use our trademarks could have a material adverse effect on our business our inability to use our trademarks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that brand awareness is a significant component in a consumer s decision to purchase one product over another in the highly competitive food and beverage industry 
our failure to continue to sell our products under our established brand names could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our trademarks and trade names are significant to the marketing and sale of our products and that the inability to utilize certain of these names could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products must comply with government regulation the usda has adopted regulations with respect to a national organic labeling and certification program which became effective february   and fully implemented on october  we currently manufacture approximately organic products which are covered by these regulations 
future developments in the regulation of labeling of organic foods could require us to further modify the labeling of our products  which could affect the sales of our products and thus harm our business 
in addition  on january   the fda proposed new policy guidelines regarding the labeling of genetically engineered foods 
the fda is currently considering the comments it received before issuing final guidance 
these guidelines  if adopted  could cause us to modify the labeling of our products  which could affect the sales of our products and thus harm our business 
the fda published the final rule amending the nutritional labeling regulations to require declaration of trans fatty acids in the nutritional label of conventional foods and dietary supplements on july  the final rule will be effective on january  additionally  an allergen labeling law was passed and signed on august  this law requires certain allergens to be clearly labeled by january  we are in the process of revising our labels to comply with the final rules 
additionally  canada has adopted new food labeling regulations that must be implemented by december   which require a nutritional facts panel to be on most food packages 
yves products will be subject to these regulations  as will all our other products sold into canada 
furthermore  new government laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscations  recalls or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our business manufacturers and distributors of products in our industry are sometimes subject to the recall of their products for a variety of reasons  including for product defects  such as ingredient contamination  packaging safety and inadequate labeling disclosure 
if any of our products are recalled due to a product defect or for any other reason  we could be required to incur the expense of the recall or the expense of any resulting legal proceeding 
additionally  if one of our significant brands were subject to recall  the image of that brand and our company could be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
product liability suits  if brought  could have a material adverse effect on our business if a product liability claim exceeding our insurance coverage were to be successfully asserted against us  it could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that such coverage will be sufficient to insure against claims which may be brought against us  or that we will be able to maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance covering existing or new products 
as a marketer of food products  we are subject to the risk of claims for product liability 
we maintain product liability insurance and generally require that our co packers maintain product liability insurance with us as a co insured 
we rely on independent certification for a number of our natural and specialty food products we rely on independent certification  such as certifications of our products as organic or kosher  to differentiate our products from others 
the loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our market position as a natural and specialty food company  which could harm our business 
we must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified

inflation management does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are o interest rates on debt and cash equivalents  and o foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and cash equivalents considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and obligations of us government agencies 
assuming year end variable debt and cash equivalents levels  a one point change in interest rates would have the effect of increasing our interest expense by approximately 
million  thereby reducing our net income by approximately 
per share 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
these changes  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and in we expect sales from non core us markets to possibly represent an increasing portion of our total net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including o periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  o price and currency exchange controls  o fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  o unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  o compliance with applicable foreign laws  and o difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors
