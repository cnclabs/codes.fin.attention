item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview highland hospitality corporation is a self advised reit that was incorporated in july to own upscale full service  premium limited service  and extended stay properties located in major convention  business  resort and airport markets in the united states and all inclusive resort properties in certain beachfront destinations outside of the united states 
we commenced operations on december  when we completed our ipo and concurrently consummated the acquisition of three hotel properties 
the ipo  including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  consisted of the sale of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
concurrent with the ipo  we sold in private placement transactions an aggregate of  shares of common stock  resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
the total net proceeds generated from the ipo  the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  and the private placement transactions were approximately million 
our initial three hotel properties were acquired from entities that were partially owned by barcel crestline  which was the sponsor of our formation and ipo 
we used approximately million of net proceeds from the ipo and issued  units of our operating partnership to acquire all of the equity interests in the three entities 
the equity interests in the three entities acquired from barcel crestline  as our sponsor  in exchange for operating partnership units have been accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and recorded at barcel crestline s historical cost basis 
the remaining equity interests in the three entities acquired from third parties have been accounted for as acquisitions of minority interests and recorded at fair value 
since the ipo and the acquisition of the initial three hotel properties on december   we have acquired hotel properties two in december and in for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including the assumption of mortgage debt of approximately million 
we have accounted for the acquisition of the hotel properties under the purchase method of accounting  recording these hotels at their acquisition costs 
as of december   we owned the following hotel properties property number of rooms location acquired portsmouth renaissance and conference center portsmouth  va december  sugar land marriott and conference center sugar land  tx december  hilton garden inn virginia beach town center virginia beach  va december  plaza san antonio marriott san antonio  tx december  hyatt regency savannah savannah  ga december  hilton tampa westshore tampa  fl january  hilton garden inn bwi airport linthicum  md january  dallas fort worth airport marriott dallas fort worth  tx may  residence inn tampa downtown tampa  fl august  courtyard savannah historic district savannah  ga august  hyatt regency wind watch long island hauppauge  ny august  courtyard boston tremont boston  ma august  crowne plaza atlanta ravinia atlanta  ga august  hilton parsippany parsippany  nj august  radisson mount laurel mount laurel  nj september  omaha marriott omaha  ne september  courtyard denver airport denver  co september  total number of rooms 
table of contents substantially all of our assets are held by  and all of our operations are conducted through our operating partnership 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  neither our company nor the operating partnership can operate hotels directly 
therefore  the operating partnership  which is owned approximately by us and approximately by other limited partners  leases its hotels to subsidiaries of hhc trs holding corporation collectively  hhc trs  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership 
hhc trs then engages hotel management companies to operate the hotels pursuant to management contracts 
hhc trs is treated as a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes 
the discussion below relates to highland hospitality corporation as of and for the year ended december  and for the period from december  commencement of operations through december  prior to december   the discussion below relates to portsmouth hotel associates  llc  which was one of the three entities that we acquired on december  and was partially owned by barcel crestline 
portsmouth hotel associates  llc is considered the predecessor to highland hospitality corporation for accounting purposes 
securities and exchange commission regulations require the inclusion of predecessor financial information for the periods prior to highland hospitality corporation s commencement of operations 
key operating metrics hotel results of operations are best explained by three key performance indicators occupancy  average daily rate adr and revenue per available room revpar  which is room revenue divided by total number of room nights 
revpar does not include food and beverage revenues or other ancillary revenues  such as telephone  parking or other guest services provided by the property 
occupancy is a major driver of room revenue  as well as other revenue categories  such as food and beverage and telephone 
adr helps to drive room revenue as well  however  it does not have a direct effect on other revenue categories 
fluctuations in occupancy are accompanied by fluctuations in most categories of variable operating costs  such as utility costs and certain labor costs such as housekeeping  resulting in varying levels of hotel profitability 
increases in adr typically result in higher hotel profitability since variable hotel expenses generally do not increase correspondingly 
thus  increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs  while increases in revpar attributable to increases in adr are accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees 
executive summary of events the year was an eventful and productive year for highland hospitality corporation 
we started having just completed a successful initial public offering and the acquisition of our first five hotel properties in december during  we acquired an additional hotels  consisting of over  rooms  for approximately million  including the assumption of mortgage debt and transaction costs 
these acquisitions were consistent with our strategy of acquiring upscale full service and premium limited service hotels that provide solid initial yields or that have the potential of becoming market leaders through renovating  re branding and repositioning efforts 
by december   just over months from the date of our initial public offering and commencement of operations  we had acquired hotel properties  consisting of over  rooms  for approximately million  including the assumption of mortgage debt  issuance of operating partnership units  and transaction costs 
we were able to acquire hotels by leveraging our equity capital and taking advantage of the favorable conditions in the debt market 
during  we raised approximately million of fixed rate mortgage debt with an average maturity of approximately seven years and an average interest rate of 
in addition to this fixed rate debt  we added a million variable rate term loan facility  of which we had drawn down million by the end of the year 
as of december   our leverage ratio was approximately 
of our debt  was fixed rate and was variable rate 

table of contents renovating and repositioning our portfolio in will be a high priority  as these efforts will drive our internal growth 
currently  approximately of our portfolio is either under renovation or ramping up to stabilization 
once these projects are complete  our improved hotel properties will be well positioned to compete as leaders in their respective markets 
with respect to the lodging industry as a whole  we believe that the industry is in the early to mid stages of a strong recovery that will produce strong top line growth and profits over the next few years and produce solid returns on investments 
overall  industry wide revpar increased in  its highest increase since forecasts for and call for a continuation of the strong revpar growth  as favorable industry fundamentals are expected to continue 
demand for hotel rooms is expected to continue to grow  fueled by the strong economic climate  favorable demographics and the return of business travel to historical levels 
supply growth remains low relative to historical averages and is predicted to remain at these low levels for the next few years 
with demand growth expected to outpace supply growth  industry occupancy should continue to move higher and position our industry for additional pricing power 
although we were pleased with the overall performance of our hotels in  as we look forward in  we expect to see improvement in our hotels performance driven by our renovation  repositioning and asset management efforts  combined with the continued strength of the lodging industry

portsmouth hotel associates  llc comparison of period from january  through december  to year ended december  with respect to the following discussion of revenues and expenses  note that a part of the reason for the decrease in revenues and expenses is due to the fact that the results of operations for include portsmouth

revenue room revenues decreased million  or  for the period from january  through december   as compared to the year ended december   largely the result of decreased room demand

liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our operating requirements  including distributions to stockholders and repayments of indebtedness  is from our hotels results of operations 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations  including distributions to stockholders required to maintain our reit status and our required debt service obligations 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
we used million to purchase hotel properties and million in improvements and additions to our hotel properties 
restricted cash increased by million 
of the million net increase in restricted cash  million relates to cash that one of our lenders required us to escrow for the renovations on the hotels that secure the lending 
as of december   million was held in escrow related to deposits we made during the year on hotel property acquisitions 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt were  including the issuance of million of fixed rate debt with average maturities of approximately seven years and an average interest rate of 
in addition to this fixed rate long term debt  we completed a million variable rate term loan facility  of which million had been drawn down by december  we used million to make principal payments on our long term debt  including million related to the refinancing of the mortgage debt on the hilton tampa westshore hotel 
we used million to pay dividends to common stockholders that were declared in june and september 
table of contents as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of borrowing capacity under the term loan facility 
an additional million will become available under the term loan facility once the seven hotel properties that secure the facility have exceeded a debt service coverage ratio set forth in the facility agreement 
in addition  we may raise up to million through the sale of equity securities pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
on february   we used approximately million to acquire the room sheraton annapolis hotel in annapolis  maryland 
we intend to invest our remaining cash and cash equivalents and additional capacity under the term loan facility in hotel properties  either through planned renovations or new hotel acquisitions 
capital expenditures we maintain each hotel in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the franchisor s standards and the agreed upon requirements in our management agreements 
the cost of all such routine maintenance  repairs and alterations will be paid out of a property improvement fund  which will be funded by a portion of hotel gross revenues 
routine repairs and maintenance will be administered by the management companies 
however  we have approval rights over capital expenditures 
a number of hotel properties have begun or are beginning major renovation projects  including the plaza san antonio marriott hotel  the hyatt regency savannah hotel  the hyatt regency wind watch long island hotel  the crowne plaza atlanta ravinia hotel  the hilton parsippany hotel  the courtyard boston tremont hotel  and the radisson mount laurel hotel 
we expect to spend approximately million on the renovations  of which approximately million will be funded from restricted cash 
we expect that the majority of cash will be committed or spent by the end of the third quarter contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
there were no other material off balance sheet arrangements at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years ground and building leases mortgage loans  including interest mezzanine loan  including interest term loan facility  including interest included in the table are the base rent payments ie  minimum lease payments due under the ground and building lease agreements for the portsmouth renaissance hotel and adjoining conference center and the conference center and parking facility adjoining the sugar land marriott hotel 
the lease agreements provide for base rent payments each year and additional rent payments once we have exceeded a specified return on our original investment 
additional rent payments are not included in the table due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the payments in the future 
however  we do not expect to make additional rent payments over the next five years 
assumes no additional borrowings under the term loan facility and interest payments based on the interest rate in effect as of december  inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 

table of contents seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is generally lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season 
we expect that our operations will generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
accordingly  we expect that we will have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
these general trends are  however  expected to be greatly influenced by overall economic cycles 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements investment in hotel properties investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost except where interests are acquired from barcel crestline and allocated to land  property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using cost segregation studies performed by management and independent third parties 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts  including lease  management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
contracts acquired which are at market do not have significant value 
an existing management or franchise agreement is typically terminated at the time of acquisition and a new agreement is entered into based on then current market terms 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotel properties may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel property exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
for restricted stock awards  we record unearned compensation equal to the number of shares awarded multiplied by the average price of our common stock on the date of the award  less the purchase price for the stock  if any 
unearned compensation is amortized using the straight line method over the period in which the restrictions lapse ie  vesting period 
for unrestricted stock awards  we record compensation expense on the date of the award equal to the number of shares awarded multiplied by the average price of our common stock on the date of the award  less the purchase price for the stock  if any 

table of contents revenue recognition hotel revenues  including room  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
because of expected future taxable income of our trs lessees  we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset as of december  should our estimate of future taxable income be less than expected  we would record an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset in the period such determination was made 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the provisions of sfas r will be effective as of july  since we currently use the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 as amended fin r  requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
previously  many of these financial instruments were classified as equity 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk 
as of december   million or of our million of long term debt was fixed 
another million was effectively fixed  as a result of an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on one of our mortgage loans at 
the remaining million of our long term debt was variable 
due to the fact that our portfolio of long term debt is substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  the fair value of our portfolio of long term debt would increase by approximately million 
although a change in market interest rates impacts the fair value of our fixed rate debt  it has no impact on interest expense incurred or cash flows 
with respect to our variable rate long term debt  if market rates of interest on our variable long term debt increase by  the increase in interest expense on our variable long term debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
on the other hand  if market rates of interest on our variable rate long term debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate long term debt 
table of contents would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our term loan facility remains at million  the balance at december
