we offer technologically advanced  highly reliable and long lasting products for imds and enable our customers to introduce imds that are progressively smaller  longer lasting  more efficient and more functional 
we also leverage our core competencies in technology and manufacturing through our electrochem power solutions eps business to develop and produce batteries and battery packs for commercial applications that demand high performance and reliability  including oil and gas exploration  oceanographic equipment and aerospace 
most of the imc products that we sell are utilized by customers in cardiac rhythm management crm devices 
the crm market comprises devices utilizing high rate batteries and capacitors such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and cardiac resynchronization therapy with backup defibrillation devices crt d and devices utilizing low or medium rate batteries but no capacitors pacemakers and crts 
all crm devices utilize other components such as enclosures and feedthroughs  and certain crm devices utilize electromagnetic interference emi filtering technology 
our customers our products are designed to provide reliable  long lasting solutions that meet the evolving requirements and needs of our customers and the end users of their products 
our medical customers include leading imd manufacturers such as guidant  st 
jude medical  medtronic  biotronik  cyberonics and the sorin group 
a substantial part of our business is conducted with a limited number of customers 
in  guidant  st 
jude medical  and medtronic collectively accounted for approximately of our total sales 
the nature and extent of our selling relationships with each crm customer are different in terms of breadth of component products purchased  purchased product volumes  length of contractual commitment  ordering patterns  inventory management and selling prices 
our eps customers are primarily companies involved in oil and gas exploration  military  oceanography and aerospace 
we have entered into long term supply agreements with some of our customers 
for each of our products  we recognize revenue when the products are shipped and title passes 
our ceo s view at the end of and the beginning of  we gathered the relevant data and information on which to base our business forecast 
much of what constitutes the bulk of the forecasting process relates to communications with customers as well as our knowledge of historic and current industry trends 
the forecasting process is inexact with some significant factors either unknown to us or out of our control 
this was certainly the case in when the decision and sudden actions of a significant customer adversely affected our sales and our earnings 
while a few isolated incidents did affect the results  it is also true that there were other more systemic contributing factors 
concentration of risk  with relatively few customers serving vertical markets  increased competition and price pressures all played a role and these factors are expected to continue into the future 
this overview will detail our reactions to all of these influences and provide a summary of how we are addressing each one of these contributing factors 
concentration of risk we will be launching new products in  and will also be providing important new services to expand our business with existing customers 
we are also nurturing opportunities to work with new customers on development programs for components for totally new interventional cardiac rhythm therapies 
increased competition we have been the premier supplier of crm device power in the form of batteries and capacitors 
we have expanded that business to also include components that make up the vast majority of those found in a typical pacemaker and defibrillator 
device feedthrough components  emi filters  hybrid molded header assemblies and enclosures are all part of our product line 
our current product portfolio offers leading technology in power sources and tantalum capacitors  and provides the opportunity for bundling these products with our new assembly capabilities to provide single source solutions 
price pressures technology leadership in a vacuum will not ensure success 
technology  no matter how advanced  must be priced to present the best value package to the customer 
to that end we continue to implement sweeping changes in our facilities and processes 
the execution of our pre production quality assurance process ppqa  with defined stage gates driven by strict adherence to six sigma criteria six sigma is a motorola trademark  will speed the new product development process and add significant efficiencies to mature product production 
six sigma is a quality methodology for eliminating defects in any process 
the fundamental objective of the six sigma methodology is the implementation of a measurement based strategy that focuses on process improvement and variation reduction 
along with these initiatives  we are excited to be commissioning two new manufacturing facilities that will provide enhanced capability for cost reduction 
as part of our continuing efforts to improve our cost structure and manufacturing efficiencies  we will be undertaking two consolidation efforts in the first will be the consolidation of our capacitor and medical battery manufacturing operations into our newly constructed advanced power source manufacturing facility in alden  ny 
also  we will be consolidating the work conducted at our carson city  nv plant into the newly constructed tijuana  mexico value add assembly facility 
we believe we will then be well positioned to offer best value pricing to the market 
foundation for the future it is important to recognize that these processes and initiatives were started over the past few years as part of our broader strategic plan 
they are the drivers at the very core of our strategy  which is to be the supplier of the highest quality  most technologically advanced and cost effective solutions for the industries we serve 
this will certainly raise the expectations of a vital and growing industry and at the same time raise the bar for our competition 
in the near term however  in reaction to the unexpected reduction in sales during  we began the difficult process of reducing our workforce to align our costs with our anticipated revenue for the year 
it is vital to understand that this realignment was totally motivated and implemented after careful consideration on how to best achieve our already established near and long term strategic goals 
the flip side to the disappointing news is confirmation that the vast majority of our customers not only met  but actually exceeded our internal projections for sales growth in in and continuing into  we witnessed an unprecedented flow of new products through the pipeline 
one near term catalyst for growth is the introduction of our q series medical batteries 
initially they will be available in two configurations qhr high rate and qmr medium rate 
these batteries hold the promise of unparalleled performance in a wide range of implantable device and neurostimulation applications and allow our customers to incorporate advanced power hungry features into these devices 
while companies typically announce new products that have modest improvements in form and or function regularly  the q series firmly establishes a new industry standard 
it delivers advanced performance criteria to an industry that historically embraces new products 
we believe the q series will represent a major breakthrough by combining a smaller size with greater energy density more power 
new products  as well as enhancements to existing products  were a big part of our story in  and will continue to gain momentum and have positive impact in and beyond 
in addition  was witness to still another watershed event that marks a unique achievement in our corporate history 
in we entered into an agreement with medtronic to provide device sub assembly services 
it allows us to add value beyond our traditional role as a provider of discrete components  while providing opportunities for cross selling and bundling products and services 
while at present we are working with medtronic in this arena and are focused on crm and neurostimulator assemblies  we feel confident in and are aggressively pursuing our options for similar agreements with other customers and products 
our work with nanotechnology driven products demonstrates real potential for generating still more milestone products serving the crm device market 
the investment wgt made in acquiring proprietary nanotechnology in is expected to provide a springboard for the next major design manufacturing performance revolution in batteries and related products 
as the word implies  nano unlocks the promise of smaller size  but just as significant it offers potential for enhanced product performance and manufacturability 
additionally  nano applications are not limited to batteries 
our critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
balance sheet caption nature of effect of variations on key critical estimate item assumptions approach used assumptions used inventories inventory standard costing requires complex variations in methods could have a calculations that include assumptions for overhead material impact on the results 
if inventories are stated at the lower absorption  scrap and sample calculations  our demand forecast for specific of cost  determined using the manufacturing yield estimates and the products is greater than actual first in  first out method  or determination of which costs are capitalizable 
demand and we fail to reduce market 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate manufacturing output accordingly  we obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory could be required to record that is not of saleable quality 
additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
goodwill and other indefinite lived we perform an annual review  or more frequently if we make certain estimates and assets indicators of potential impairment exist  to assumptions that affect the determine if the recorded goodwill and other determination of the expected future goodwill is initially recorded when indefinite lived assets are impaired 
we assess cash flows from our goodwill and the purchase price paid for an these assets for impairment by comparing the fair indefinite lived assets 
these acquisition exceeds the estimated value of the reporting units to their carrying estimates and assumptions include fair value of the net identified value to determine if there is potential sales growth projections  cost of tangible and intangible assets impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit capital projections  and other key acquired 
other indefinite lived is less than its carrying value  an impairment indications of future cash flows 
assets such as trademark names are loss is recorded to the extent that the implied significant changes in these considered unamortizing intangible fair value of the goodwill within the reporting estimates and assumptions could assets as they are expected to unit is less than its carrying value 
fair values create future impairment losses in generate cash flows indefinitely 
for goodwill are determined based on discounted either reporting unit 
these assets are subject to the cash flows  market multiples or appraised values estimation risks related to the as appropriate 
purchase price allocation conducted at acquisition 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when estimation of the useful lives of events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets that are long lived requires property  plant and equipment  the carrying value of the assets may not be significant management judgment 
definite lived intangible assets  recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding events could occur  including changes and other long lived assets are when to perform an impairment review include in cash flow that would materially carried at cost 
this cost is significant under performance of a business or affect our estimates and assumptions charged to depreciation or product line in relation to expectations  related to depreciation 
unforeseen amortization expense over the significant negative industry or economic trends  changes in operations or technology estimated life of the operating and significant changes or planned changes in our could substantially alter the assets primarily using straight line use of the assets 
recoverability potential is assumptions regarding the ability to rates 
long lived assets acquired measured by comparing the carrying amount of the realize the return of our investment through acquisition are subject to asset to the related total future undiscounted cash in operating assets and therefore the the estimation risks related to the flows 
if an asset s carrying value is not amount of depreciation expense to initial purchase price allocation 
recoverable through related cash flows  the asset charge against both current and is considered to be impaired 
impairment is future sales 
also  as we make measured by comparing the asset s carrying amount manufacturing process conversions and to its fair value  based on the best information other factory planning decisions  we available  including market prices or discounted must make subjective judgments cash flow analysis 
when it is determined that regarding the remaining useful lives useful lives of assets are shorter than originally of assets  primarily manufacturing estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to equipment and building improvements 
support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of depreciation in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives 
balance sheet caption nature of effect of variations on key critical estimate item assumptions approach used assumptions used provision for income taxes in relation to recording the provision for income changes could occur that would taxes  management must estimate the future tax materially affect our estimates and in accordance with the liability rates applicable to the reversal of tax assumptions regarding deferred method of accounting for income differences  make certain assumptions regarding taxes 
changes in current tax laws taxes specified in statement of whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and tax rates could affect the financial accounting standards no 
and the related time of expected reversal 
also  valuation of deferred tax assets and  accounting for income taxes  estimates are made as to whether taxable operating liabilities  thereby changing the the provision for income taxes is income in future periods will be sufficient to income tax provision 
also  the sum of income taxes both fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
if significant declines in taxable currently payable and deferred 
the recovery is not likely  we must increase our income could materially impact the changes in deferred tax assets and provision for taxes by recording a valuation realizable value of deferred tax liabilities are determined based allowance against the deferred tax assets that we assets 
at december  we had upon the changes in differences estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
million of deferred tax assets between the basis of assets and alternatively  we may make estimates about the on our balance sheet

shares outstanding at december  differences reverse 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be

the nature and extent of our selling relationship with each crm customer is different in terms of component products purchased  selling prices  product volumes  ordering patterns and inventory management 
we have pricing arrangements with our customers that many times do not specify minimum order quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time 
our customers may have inventory management programs and alternate supply arrangements of which we are unaware 
additionally  the relative market share among the crm device manufacturers changes periodically 
consequently  these and other factors can significantly impact our sales in any given period 
volume accounted for approximately of the decrease in imc sales  primarily due to lower demand by a major customer for wet tantalum capacitors 
total sales to this customer declined by million in comparison to sales to other customers increased by over the balance of the decrease was attributable to lower selling prices 
we believe that pricing pressures will continue into the near future 
the decrease in volume of batteries and capacitors was partially offset by increased volume of other imc products  primarily coated components 
the overall markets for crm and neuro are expected to experience double digit growth for the next three to five years 
eps 
similar to imc customers  we have pricing arrangements with our customers that many times do not specify minimum quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time 
the increase in eps sales is due to volume  resulting from increased demand in the oil and gas market both domestically and internationally 
gross profit the basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the following factors a 
lower imc selling prices basis points  and b 
increased period costs resulting from excess capacity at our wet tantalum capacitor manufacturing plant basis points 
c 
savings instituted during the year basis points  primarily scrap reductions 
sg a expenses the realignment of management resources resulted in a million reduction in allocated costs to sg a 
expenses also decreased as a result of cost savings initiatives instituted mid year including incentive compensation reductions of approximately million 
these savings were partially offset by costs of approximately million associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
the remaining million of expenses were comprised of individually insignificant items 
rd e expenses expenses prior to reimbursements increased by million 
the main causes of this increase include additional costs related to the chief technology officer position 
million  additional development project expenses million and the balance was primarily due to the acquisition of nanogram in march these costs were offset by an increase in development efforts for projects where the company is reimbursed for achieving certain development milestones 
the increase in reimbursements amounted to approximately million 
we expect to maintain our spending on rd e at a level that will support the new technologies demanded by the customers we serve 
amortization expense the increase primarily reflects the impact of the additional intangible amortization resulting from the nanogram acquisition 
the amortization of the nanogram intangibles amounts to approximately million in there was also a million reduction in expense as certain definite lived intangibles were fully amortized during other operating expense the amount comprised the following a 
million associated with patents acquired in the second quarter 
these patents cover how capacitors are used in an icd 
although management believes the patents could have been successfully challenged in court proceedings  a decision was made to acquire the patents and remove this as a potential obstacle for existing customers to more fully adopt wet tantalum technology and for potential customers to initially adopt the technology  b 
million related to severance cost from a mid year reduction in workforce  c 
million related to costs associated with the start up of tijuana facility  and d 
million primarily related to various asset disposals 
interest expense and interest income interest expense increased due to the addition of million in interest bearing debt in may of resulting from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes 
interest income increased as the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes provided additional funds that are being invested on a short term basis 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against certain new york state deferred tax assets 
based on managements review  after considering both the positive and negative support  it was determined that certain tax assets primarily investment tax credits and employees incentive credits were not considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
the tax provision increase related to the valuation allowance was million 
our effective tax rate is below the united states statutory rate primarily as a result of federal and state tax credits  and the extraterritorial income exclusion eti for of 
the american jobs creation act of pl the act signed into law on october  repeals the eti after december   and creates new tax incentives for a broad spectrum of taxpayers 
we have not completed a full assessment on how this law change will impact the company due to the potential changes in our manufacturing locations 
fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in total sales for included a full year of sales of globe  which we acquired in july the globe acquisition added million  million  and million to sales  gross profit  and operating expenses respectively in compared to sales imc 
the sales growth for imc was led by sales of icd batteries reflecting the strength of this market 
in addition  capacitor and components sales increased substantially over last year 
substantially all of the sales changes during were attributable to volume and sales mix 
looking at our overall sales mix  crm product sales increased over and represented of our overall product mix  up from in eps 
commercial sales increased modestly from a slight rise in volume of orders from oil and gas customers 
gross profit the following factors contributed to an approximately a basis point decline in the gross margin between and a 
consolidation of eps plants basis points  b 
start up costs from lean manufacturing basis points  c 
inclusion of enclosure products basis points  d 
hiring of new plant management personnel basis points  and e 
changes in selling prices for certain medical components basis points 
sg a expenses expenses increased in absolute dollars  but declined as a percent of sales due to improved operating leverage 
the million increase in sg a was comprised of the following factors a 
incentive compensation and profit sharing expense million  b 
incremental senior management related expenses million  c 
corporate spending for information technology million  and d 
all other sg a comprised of individually insignificant items million 
rd e expenses expenses increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percent of sales as sales growth outpaced spending 
the increase in rd e was comprised primarily of the million of expenses for the development of our qhr high rate battery product 
amortization expense the reduction in intangible amortization reflects the impact of the sale of certain intangible assets of the ceramic capacitor product line that was part of the sierra kd components acquisition in in addition  one of the patent licenses for wet tantalum capacitors was fully amortized during other operating expense the amount is primarily attributable to the write down of a manufacturing facility that became available for sale as the result of a decision to purchase an additional manufacturing facility in new york 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was lower and interest income was higher primarily due to the issuance of the million convertible subordinated notes in may these securities allowed for the outstanding line of credit to be fully replaced at a lower rate of interest and additional funds to be invested on a short term basis 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate declined primarily as a result of increased research and development credits  as well as the benefits of state tax planning strategies 
the impact of the lower effective tax rate during was approximately million 
the eti provided approximately million of tax benefit in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our operating cash flow combined with our working capital of million at december  and our unused million credit line with our lending syndicate 
historically we have generated cash from operations sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and debt service needs  other than for acquisitions 
at december   our current ratio was  so short term liquidity is not a concern to management at this time 
the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions and may announce an acquisition transaction at any time 
however  no active negotiations are presently being conducted 
operating activities in all years presented significant positive cash flows from operating activities were achieved 
net cash provided by operating activities exceeded the combination of net income  depreciation and amortization due to the favorable cash flow impact of deferred taxes 
over the three year period  changes in operating assets and liabilities amounted to a net use of cash of approximately million 
investing activities capital spending of million in was significantly higher than historical expenditure levels 
the majority of the current year spending was for the following a 
new medical power manufacturing plant in alden  ny million  b 
oracle erp system million  and c 
new assembly plant in tijuana  mexico million 
in comparison  we spent million in  which was primarily related to normal maintenance capital 
in march  we purchased nanogram for approximately million 
the most significant elements of the purchase price allocation were to patented and unpatented technology and goodwill 
nanogram has a strong intellectual property position around the laser pyrolysis process and accordingly a significant allocation was made to these assets 
the cost will be amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of years 
for the amortization expense was approximately million per month 
the residual amount of the allocation of million went to goodwill  which is not amortized but rather subject to periodic testing for impairment 
pursuant to the valuation we obtained  the status of the nanogram technology was sufficiently advanced such that technical feasibility requirements were met at the acquisition date  consequently  no in process r d charge was recorded 
nanogram was a materials research and development company focused on developing nanoscale materials for use in various battery and potentially other medical device applications 
the primary purpose of this acquisition is to provide us with additional intellectual property as well as additional research and development capabilities 
nanogram is now referred to as our advanced research laboratory 
since the primary function of this operation is research and development  all costs are appropriately classified in that category 
no sales revenue was attributable to this acquisition in in  approximately million was spent related to the acquisition of globe 
globe was a manufacturer of precision titanium enclosures for imds 
globe was acquired to further broaden our product offerings to include enclosures 
approximately million of short term investments were converted to cash during the year 
financing activities during  we successfully completed a million convertible subordinated notes offering 
the proceeds of this offering were utilized to repay million in long term debt that was previously outstanding 
capital structure at december   our capital structure consisted primarily of million of convertible subordinated notes and our million shares of common stock outstanding 
we have in excess of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and are in a position to facilitate future acquisitions if necessary 
we are also authorized to issue million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
the market value of our outstanding common stock since our ipo has exceeded our book value and the average daily trading volume of our common stock has also increased  accordingly  we believe that if needed we can access public markets to sell additional common or preferred stock assuming conditions are appropriate 
our capital structure allows us to support our internal growth and provides liquidity for corporate development initiatives 
the current expectation for is that capital spending is expected to be in the range of million to million  primarily due to the build out of the advanced manufacturing facility million  our value add assembly plant million  and normal maintenance capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
litigation we are a party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
while we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending activities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in the period in which the ruling occurs 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations a convertible debentures   capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations b      purchase obligations c   total      a the current portion of these liabilities is included 
amounts do not include imputed interest 
the annual interest expense on the convertible debentures is  or million 
see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information about our long term obligations 
b see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information about our operating lease obligations 
c purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are normally based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we enter into blanket orders with vendors that have preferred pricing and terms  however these orders are normally cancelable by us without penalty 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements in the short term 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
during  the company commenced the build out of its medical battery and capacitor manufacturing facility in alden  ny and its value add manufacturing facility in tijuana  mexico 
these facilities will enable the company to further consolidate its operations and implement state of the art manufacturing capabilities at both locations 
the contractual obligations for construction of these facilities is million and will be financed by existing  or internally generated cash 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  or over the period that a performance measure is expected to be met 
we will adopt sfas r on july   requiring compensation cost to be recorded as expense for the portion of the outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated using the black scholes option pricing model currently used under sfas for proforma disclosures 
based on unvested options currently outstanding  the effect of adopting sfas r will reduce our net income by approximately million in the second half of in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that such items be recognized as current period charges  regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or liquidity 
subsequent events on february  we announced our intent to consolidate our medical capacitor manufacturing operations  currently in cheektowaga  ny  and the implantable medical battery manufacturing operations  currently in clarence  ny  into the advanced power source manufacturing facility in alden  ny 
we will also consolidate the capacitor research  development and engineering operations from the cheektowaga  ny  facility into the existing implantable medical battery research  development  and engineering operations in clarence  ny 
the total cost estimated for these consolidation efforts is anticipated to be between and million 
we expect to incur this additional expense over the next four fiscal quarters 
the major categories of costs to be incurred  which will primarily be cash expenditures  include the following o production inefficiencies and revalidation to million  o training to million  o moving and facility closures million to million  and o infrastructure to million on march  we announced our intent to close the carson city  nv facility and consolidate the work performed at carson city into the tijuana  mexico facility 
the total estimated cost for this facility consolidation plan is anticipated to be between million and million 
we expect to incur this additional cost over the next four fiscal quarters 
the major categories of costs to be incurred include the following o costs related to the shut down of the carson city facility a 
severance and retention to million  b 
accelerated depreciation to million  and c 
other to million o costs related to the move and consolidation of work into tijuana a 
production inefficiencies and revalidation to million  b 
relocation and moving expenses to million  c 
personnel costs including travel  training and duplicate wages to million  and d 
other to million all categories of costs are considered to be future cash expenditures  except accelerated depreciation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our existing line of credit any borrowings bear interest at fluctuating market rates 
at december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our line of credit and thus no interest rate sensitive financial instruments
