item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
apache s cash flows totaled billion  an increase of percent from cash flows of billion 
the increase was attributable primarily to higher oil and gas production revenues which were driven by increases in both production volumes and realized prices and partially offset by higher operating expenses 
oil and natural gas production increased and percent  respectively 
the increase in oil production was primarily attributable to our acquisition of properties in the north sea and first production from our china operations 
the increase in natural gas production was primarily related to two significant acquisitions in the gulf of mexico  which offset declines in other core areas 
oil and natural gas prices increased and percent  respectively on higher worldwide commodity prices 
higher lease operating costs were primarily attributable to the acquisition of the north sea properties  which carry a higher rate per unit than our other core areas  and where  upon taking over operations  we performed multiple platform turnarounds and repair and maintenance projects aimed at increasing production and lowering operating costs over the long term 
outside of the united states  costs were higher with an increase in exchange rates and the impact of higher commodity prices in canada  more workover activity in egypt and higher repair and maintenance costs in australia 
for a more detailed discussion of commodity prices  production  operating costs and acquisitions please refer to the results of operations section of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
historically  fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
sales volume changes have also impacted cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past 
apache s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations 
debt during  we continued to strengthen our financial flexibility and to build on the solid financial positions of previous years 
we exited with a debt to capitalization ratio of percent  a decrease of two percent from year end  with slightly higher debt offset by increases in equity resulting from earnings 
at year end the company had long term debt of billion  million higher than year end  as the company s billion in capital spending slightly exceeded internally generated cash flow 
the company s outstanding debt consisted of million under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit and a total of billion of other debt 
this other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years through approximately 
million  million  
million  million and billion mature in    and thereafter  respectively 
during  the company maintained its senior unsecured long term debt ratings of a from moody s and a from standard and poor s 
in june  fitch upgraded apache s senior unsecured long term debt rating from a to a 
the company has a billion commercial paper program which enables apache to borrow funds for up to days at competitive interest rates 
the commercial paper balances of million and million at december  and  respectively  were classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under its us credit facilities 
if the company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market  the company s us credit facilities are available as a percent backstop 
the weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was percent in and percent in as of december   available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities was billion 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   an increase from million at the prior year end 
on may   the company s million day us credit facility matured and was replaced with a new five year credit facility which matures may  also on this date  the company amended its existing million facility and its two existing million facilities in order to make their terms consistent with the new five year facility 
significant changes included raising the cross default threshold  increasing flexibility under the negative lien covenant and eliminating covenants which established minimum levels for tangible net worth and book values for assets of apache and certain subsidiaries 
the financial covenants of the credit facilities require the company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than percent at the end of any fiscal quarter 
the negative covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to create liens and security interests on our assets  with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry  purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law  such as tax and mechanics liens 
the company may incur liens on assets located in the us  canada and australia of up to five percent of the company s consolidated assets  which approximated million at december  there are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the us  canada and australia 
there are also restrictions on apache s ability to merge with another entity  unless the company is the surviving entity  and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group 
there are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes mac clauses 
the credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings 
however  the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if apache corporation  or any of its us  canadian and australian subsidiaries  defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of million or has any unpaid  non appealable judgment against it in excess of million 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of december  stock transactions the company periodically uses access to equity capital markets to fund significant acquisitions 
on january   in conjunction with the bp transaction  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of common stock  including million shares for the underwriters over allotment option  for net proceeds of million 
the company currently has no plans to access equity capital markets 
the company s board of directors approved a stock split and several stock dividends in  and  a reflection of their belief that we can reward our shareholders while remaining focused on our primary objective of building apache to last by achieving profitable growth 
on december   we announced that holders of our common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to million from million in order to complete a previously announced two for one stock split 
the record date for the stock split was december  and the additional shares were distributed on january  on december   our board of directors declared a five percent stock dividend payable on april  to shareholders of record on march  as a result  in december  we reclassified approximately million from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital  which represents the fair market value at the date of declaration of the shares distributed 
in  at the date of the distribution  an additional million was reclassified from retained earnings to common stock and paid in capital 
no fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares 
on may   we completed the mandatory conversion of our series c preferred stock into approximately million common shares 
oil and gas capital expenditures the company funded its exploration and production e d capital expenditures  including gathering  transportation and marketing gtm facilities  of billion  billion and million in  and  respectively  primarily with internally generated cash flow of billion  billion and billion 
the company uses a combination of internally generated cash flow  borrowings under the company s lines of credit and commercial paper program and  from time to time  issues of public debt or common stock to fund its significant acquisitions 
during the three year period presented  the company primarily used internally generated cash flow or its lines of credit and commercial paper program  which were subsequently paid down with internally generated cash flow 
however  in in conjunction with the bp acquisition  the company completed a public offering of approximately million shares of common stock  including million shares for the underwriters over allotment option  for net proceeds of million 
the following table presents a summary of the company s capital expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the past three years 
year ended december  in thousands exploration and development united states    canada    egypt    australia    north sea   other international    capitalized interest    gas gathering transmission and processing facilities    acquisitions oil and gas properties    gas gathering  transmission and processing facilities   in  apache drilled a record number of wells and completed two significant acquisitions 
each of our north america operating areas drilled a record number of wells in in the gulf of mexico the majority of our activity focused in and around our existing asset base  including continued exploitation of the properties purchased from bp and shell in and the anadarko properties purchased in in the central region  where apache got its start years ago  estimated proved reserves increased percent in through a combination of the exxonmobil acquisition and apache s most active drilling year  completing of wells in the region 
canada was our most active area with over  wells drilled  three fourths of which were shallow development wells  with over percent completed as producers 
at the forties field  an experienced workforce is tackling projects to extend the life of the largest field in the united kingdom sector of the north sea 
production increases at forties the anchor of apache s newest core area were driven by apache s first drilling program since acquiring the field and a maintenance program aimed at improving efficiency of the field 
during  apache completed of wells drilled as part of a million capital program  including million of maintenance and operations capital expenditures 
in egypt and australia  apache continued its successful exploration programs with several new discoveries 
our continuing development program in egypt increased gross production to over  b d for the first time 
capital expenditures in china decreased in with the completion of production facilities and first production in the second half of in  apache added mmboe of estimated proved reserves through acquisitions  drilling and revisions 
during  gtm expenditures included additional gathering system pipelines in egypt and a gas plant expansion on varanus island in australia 
in  e d capital expenditures increased approximately million over the previous year with more drilling and development activity in each of our cores areas 
apache drilled more wells than it ever had in canada  completing of wells 
apache s successful drilling program in egypt pushed production to then all time highs and resulted in several discoveries  including the largest discovery in the history of the company at the qasr x well in the khalda offset concession 
in the north sea  which apache acquired in april  we began a program of upgrades to the surface facilities to increase efficiencies 
for  we plan another active year of drilling 
because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions and results to date  accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best 
however  our preliminary estimate of exploration and development capital expenditures for is in excess of billion 
we do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable 
however  we continually look for properties which we believe will add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise 
cash dividend payments the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive years through future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
the company increased its quarterly cash dividend percent  to eight cents per share from six cents per share  effective with the november dividend payment 
during  apache paid a total of million in dividends on its series b preferred stock issued in august dividends on the series c preferred stock were paid through may   when the shares automatically converted to common stock 
see note  capital stock of item in this form k 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
contractual obligations we are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations 
these contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt  operating leases  pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments 
the company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for further information regarding these obligations 
note contractual obligations reference total thereafter in thousands long term debt note     operating leases and other commitments note        international lease commitments note       operating costs associated with pre existing volumetric production payments on acquired properties note      total contractual obligations a b        a this table does not include the liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties 
effective with adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january   the company recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation 
see note  asset retirement obligation of item in this form k for further discussion 
b this table does not include the company s pension or postretirement benefit obligations 
see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for further discussion 
apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur 
the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement  which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity 
such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation 
apache s management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations 
the company has reserved approximately million for environmental remediation 
the company has also reserved approximately million for various legal liabilities  in addition to the million  plus interest  we accrued for the texaco china bv litigation 
see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s environmental and legal contingencies 
in  the company accrued approximately million for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with oil insurance limited oil 
apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property  pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the company 
as part of its membership  the company is contractually committed to pay termination fees if apache ever withdraws from oil 
apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool  however  the potential termination fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued 
the calculation will change annually based on future period losses incurred by oil 
as discussed under note  acquisitions and divestitures of item in this form k  apache assumed obligations for pre existing vpps in the acquisition of properties from anadarko and the acquisition of properties from shell 
under the terms of the vpp agreements  apache is scheduled to deliver a total of mmboe in  mmboe in  mmboe in and mmboe in to morgan stanley as owner of the vpp interests 
morgan stanley is entitled to the first production and may demand up to percent of the production from the assets encumbered by each vpp in any given month to satisfy the vpp interests 
however  they have no right to look to other assets or production of apache 
apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the vpps 
as of december   apache has booked a total of mmboe of reserves attributable to the anadarko and shell transactions 
the vpps are non operating interests  free of costs incurred for operations and production 
apache provided a liability for these costs as reflected in the preceding table 
upon closing of our acquisition of the north sea properties  apache assumed bp s abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price 
the purchase of the properties  however  did not relieve bp of its liabilities if apache fails to satisfy the abandonment obligation 
although not currently required  to ensure apache s payment of these costs  apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to bp if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both moody s and standard and poor s from the company s current ratings of a and a  respectively 
any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the north sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change 
if apache is required to provide a letter of credit  it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level 
the letter of credit amount would be million british pounds  an amount that represents the letter of credit requirement through march  and will be negotiated annually based on apache s future abandonment obligation estimates 
the company s future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by standard and poor s and moody s  however  we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely 
the company s credit facilities do not require the company to maintain a minimum credit rating 
the negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail under capital resources and liquidity  debt in this section of this form k 
in addition  generally under our commodity hedge agreements  apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the company s credit ratings decline significantly 
off balance sheet arrangements apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions 
apache entered into a partnership with exxonmobil to obtain additional interests in specific west texas and new mexico oil gas properties acquired from exxonmobil in september as discussed in note  acquisitions and divestitures of item in this form k  apache contributed million into this partnership which was determined to be a variable interest entity as defined by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
variable interest entities 
apache concluded that they were not the primary beneficiary of the partnership and  therefore  proportionately consolidated only the company s portion of the oil and gas properties 
critical accounting policies and estimates full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals  are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged through income 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
generally  the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting 
reserve estimates our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
as such  our reserve engineers review and revise the company s reserve estimates at least annually 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves 
during  and  their review covered  and percent of the reserve value  respectively 
costs excluded under the full cost method of accounting  oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the company s accounting  exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred 
nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of drilling individual wells 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play 
this evaluation considers among other factors  seismic data  requirements to relinquish acreage  drilling results  remaining time in the commitment period  remaining capital plans  and political  economic  and market conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties of which we are the operator 
thus  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months 
we accrue a reserve on a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated 
beginning in  we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from egpc for our egyptian oil and gas sales 
deteriorating economic conditions in egypt lessened the availability of us dollars  resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from egpc 
during  we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts  but our past due balance improved at year end 
we have not established a reserve for these egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid  albeit late  and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable 
asset retirement obligation the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
apache s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
prior to  under the full cost method of accounting  as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections  the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations  net of the value of salvage  were included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
apache adopted this statement effective january   as discussed in note  asset retirement obligation of item of this form k 
sfas no 
significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  the new statement requires the company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the company s asset retirement obligations  with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet 
as such  beginning in our depletion expense is reduced since we will deplete a discounted aro rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted in our oil and gas property base 
the lower depletion expense under sfas no 
is offset  however  by accretion expense  which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
also  the company had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into the quarterly calculation of its full cost ceiling tests see note  summary of significant accounting policies of item in this form k 
sfas no 
is silent with respect to this issue and  although there were various views  the company initially elected to perform the calculation similarly to the prior year by including expected abandonment costs as a reduction to the present value of future net revenues used to determine the ceiling limitation 
the oil and gas property balance is capped by this limitation 
because abandonment costs are now reflected in the oil and gas property balance  the company reduced the property balance by the accrued abandonment liability to place it on a comparable basis with the ceiling 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
to provide new guidance on how asset retirement obligations should impact the calculation of the ceiling test 
the new guidance states that the property balance should not be adjusted  however  the expected future abandonment costs should be omitted from the present value ceiling limitation to provide for a comparable basis when performing the calculation 
based on this guidance  the company changed its method of calculating the ceiling test as of year end and there was no material impact to the financial statements 
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in seven countries 
as a result  we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
the company regularly assesses and  if required  establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates 
tax reserves have been established  and include any related interest  despite the belief by the company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the company s tax returns 
these reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits  case law and any new legislation 
the company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments 
derivatives apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility 
the company accounts for the contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the estimated fair values of apache s derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
for foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs 
sfas no 
requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income  rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled 
realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in other 
the fair value estimate of apache s derivative contracts requires judgment  however  the company s derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets 
as such  the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data 
option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  commodity risk in this form k for commodity price sensitivity information and the company s policies related to the use of derivatives 
stock based compensation during  apache began modifying its stock compensation plans in order to reflect the cost of these plans in the statement of consolidated operations 
as part of this effort  apache began issuing stock appreciation rights and restricted stock and  effective january   adopted the expense provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  as amended  on a prospective basis for all stock options granted under the company s existing option plans 
consistent with the company s desire to reflect the ultimate cost of stock compensation plans on the income statement  apache early adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment upon the fasb s issuance of the revised statement in the fourth quarter in response to certain changes in us tax laws passed in  for future compensation the company plans to make grants of stock options  rather than share appreciation rights  assuming the company s shareholders approve a new stock option plan at the annual meeting of shareholders 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  all stock based compensation awards that vested during are now reflected in the company s net income for the year 
awards that vested in prior years continue to be reflected in the income statement under the accounting guidelines in place for the applicable year 
awards granted in future periods will be valued on the date of grant and expensed using a straight line basis over the required service period 
pro forma income statement presentations have been provided for in note summary of significant accounting policies of item in this form k to present a comparative basis of all plans outstanding during the reported periods 
the company chose to adopt the statement under the modified retrospective approach as prescribed under sfas no 
r 
under this approach  the company is required to expense all options and stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation determined on the date of grant 
had the company not early adopted sfas no 
r under this transition approach  net income would have been lower by million million after tax or 
per diluted share 
normally  net income would be negatively impacted by adopting sfas no 
r under this transition method 
however  the company s share appreciation plan which triggered in has a fair market value based expense recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
r that is substantially less than the intrinsic value cost that would have been recorded under the provisions of apb opinion no 
please refer to note  capital stock of item of this form k for a detailed description of the share appreciation plan 
also  inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation under sfas no 
r are several judgments and estimates that must be made 
these include determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation  such as the company s expected stock price volatility  expected term of the employee option  expected dividend yield  the expected risk free interest rate  the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option 
changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant 
for valuation purposes  apache has historically utilized the black scholes option pricing model  however  the company is currently evaluating its policy to determine if a different method should be used  such as a lattice model 
apache s next grant to substantially all company employees is anticipated to occur in may item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our united states and canadian natural gas production 
prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable 
monthly oil price realizations  including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges  ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during average gas price realizations  including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges  ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
based on the company s worldwide oil production levels  a per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by million 
based on the company s worldwide gas production levels  a 
per mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by million 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the securities exchange commission sec 
under these rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes  do not exceed the ceiling 
this ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  net of related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to additional dd a expense 
the calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts 
write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities  however  as discussed above  sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows 
we periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as indicated in note  hedging and derivative instruments of item in this form k  the company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with our  and acquisitions 
these positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices and were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated production 
apache has historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions 
as such  the company s use of hedging activity remains at a correspondingly low level 
in  financial derivative hedges represented approximately percent of the total worldwide natural gas production and four percent of the total worldwide crude oil production 
heading into  hedges in place were entirely related to us production and represented percent and six percent of worldwide production for natural gas and crude oil  respectively 
on december   the company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of million 
a percent change in natural gas prices would change the fair value by plus or minus million 
the company also had open oil price swap positions with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in oil prices would reduce the fair value by million 
a percent decrease in oil prices would increase the fair value by million
