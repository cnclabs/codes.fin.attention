critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
see note general and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical  as they require management s highest degree of judgment  estimates and assumptions 
we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows ship accounting our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
depreciation of ships  which includes amortization of ships under capital leases  is computed net of a projected residual value using the straight line method over estimated service lives of primarily years 
improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements estimated useful lives 
the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of refurbished or replaced ship components are written off and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in cruise operating expenses 
repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred and drydocking costs are accrued evenly over the period to the next scheduled drydocking 
our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes  long term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly built ships 
in addition  we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships major component systems  such as hull  superstructure  main electric  engines and cabins 
given the very large and complex nature of our ships  our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain 
we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems  therefore  we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry 
we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems  but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes 
however  should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values  depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower 
if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized  the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense 
if we had reduced our estimated average year ship service life by one year  depreciation expense for would have increased by approximately million 
further  if our ships were estimated to have no residual value  depreciation expense for would have increased by approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
such markets are often not available for used cruise ships 
accordingly  we also base fair value on independent appraisals  sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with our business risk 
the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues  operating costs  marketing  selling and administrative expenses  interest rates  ship additions and retirements  cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions  among other factors 
goodwill is reviewed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review consists of comparing the fair value of goodwill to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value 
we use the market capitalization method in determining the fair value of our goodwill 
if  under certain circumstances  this method is not representative of fair value  we use a present value of future cash flows approach 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets and goodwill have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 
contingencies litigation on an ongoing basis  we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
in assessing probable losses  we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries  if any 
we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries  it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 
terminology available passenger cruise days apcd are our measurement of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period 
gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing  selling and administrative expenses 
gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 
net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions  transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the summary of historical results of operations heading 
in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income  we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance 
we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure 
accordingly  we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 
net yields represent gross yields less commissions  transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the summary of historical results of operations heading per apcd 
we utilize net yields to manage our business on a day to day basis and believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance 
we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure 
accordingly  we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 
occupancy percentage  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice  is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd 
a percentage in excess of indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 
passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 
overview our revenues consist of the following passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to our ships 
onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and or services onboard our ships  cancellation fees  sales of vacation protection insurance and pre and post tours 
also included are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and or services onboard our ships 
our cruise operating expenses consist of the following commissions  transportation and other expenses consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues  including travel agent commissions  air and other transportation expenses  port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 
onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues 
these costs include the cost of products sold onboard our ships  vacation protection insurance premiums  costs associated with pre and post tours and related credit card fees 
concession revenues have minimal costs associated with them  as the costs related to these activities are incurred by the concessionaires 
payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard personnel 
food expenses include food costs for both passengers and crew 
other operating expenses consist of operating costs such as fuel  repairs and maintenance  port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts  insurance  entertainment and all other operating costs 
we do not allocate payroll and related costs  food costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 
summary of historical results of operations we reported historical total revenues  operating income  net income and earnings per share as shown in the following table in thousands  except per share data year ended december  total revenues operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share  eitf in our fourth quarter of and restated prior period diluted earnings per share amounts for comparative purposes 
the implementation of eitf did not change our previously reported diluted earnings per share  however  it reduced our previously reported diluted earnings per share by 
unaudited selected historical statistical information is shown in the following table year ended december  passengers carried passenger cruise days apcd occupancy percentage the following table presents historical operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the last three years year ended december  passenger ticket revenues onboard and other revenues total revenues cruise operating expenses commissions  transportation and other onboard and other payroll and related food other operating total cruise operating expenses marketing  selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses operating income other income expense net income net income was million or per share on a diluted basis in  compared to million or per share in and million or per share in revenues for increased to billion from revenues of billion in the increase in revenues was a result of a increase in capacity along with increases in cruise ticket prices  occupancy levels and onboard revenues as consumer sentiment towards leisure travel improved in during  net yields increased compared to cruise operating expenses increased in compared to primarily as a result of increases in capacity  the effect of higher cruise ticket prices on commission expenses and higher fuel prices 
net cruise costs per apcd increased in compared to in addition  net income in included costs of approximately million related to the impact of hurricanes 
revenues in increased to billion from revenues of billion in the increase in revenues was a result of a increase in capacity  partially offset by lower cruise ticket prices and occupancy levels 
in and  our business was adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks of september   the war in iraq  the economy and the publicity surrounding severe acute respiratory syndrome and noroviruses 
as a result  we experienced lower cruise ticket prices attributed to consumer apprehension towards travel 
net income in included a charge of million recorded in connection with a litigation settlement 
in  we reduced the amount of the charge by approximately million based on the actual number of claims filed 
net income in also included net proceeds of million received in connection with the termination of our merger agreement with p o princess cruises plc p o princess 
see note termination of proposed combination with p o princess cruises plc to our consolidated financial statements 
outlook consumer demand is healthy across all products and for both brands 
many of the demand characteristics are similar to those we experienced in the late s 
as a result  we expect net yields for the first quarter of to increase approximately and  for the full year  to increase in the range of to 
we also expect that in we will have a relatively small capacity increase of  which means fewer economies of scale to absorb inflationary and other cost pressures 
in addition  uncertainty about fuel costs makes forecasting difficult 
we previously said that assuming the yearly average at the pump price of fuel in is the same as the yearly average in and adjusting for fewer fuel hedges  we expected net cruise costs to increase in the range of to per apcd 
expected fuel prices for the first quarter of are about higher than the yearly average 
assuming at the pump fuel prices are higher for the remainder of than the average  our net cruise costs per apcd would increase by an additional  or approximately million  as compared to the previous guidance 
this increase is after taking into account the benefit of our fuel hedges 
in addition  the timing of certain expenses  including marketing  has been deferred from the first quater to later in the year 
we also expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of million to million and net interest expense to be in the range of million to million in additionally  will be the initial year we accrue income taxes associated with the final regulations under internal revenue code section we expect the application of the final regulations to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately to 
other items affecting include the following in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense at the fair value of employee stock awards  except for employee share purchase plans if they meet certain conditions 
we expect this change to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately 
enchantment of the seas is scheduled to undergo a lengthening in the spring of with a new foot midsection 
in connection with this project  the ship will be out of service from may until early july in addition to lost revenue associated with a decrease in apcd  we expect expenses associated with this project to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately 
including the revised assumption for fuel and our expectations concerning other items set forth above  we now expect diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of to be in the range of to 
notwithstanding the revised assumption for fuel  our expectation for full year diluted earnings per share remains unchanged in the range of to 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues gross yields and net yields were calculated as follows in thousands  except apcd and yields year ended december  passenger ticket revenues onboard and other revenues total revenues less commissions  transportation and other onboard and other net revenues apcd gross yields net yields net revenues increased in compared to the increase was due to a increase in capacity and a increase in net yields 
the increase in capacity was primarily associated with the full year effect of the additions of serenade of the seas and mariner of the seas in and delivery of jewel of the seas in the increase in capacity was partially offset by the cancellation of days of sailings in due to hurricanes and unscheduled drydocks 
the increase in net yields was primarily due to higher cruise ticket prices  occupancy levels and amounts spent per passenger onboard 
these increases were primarily attributable to improved consumer sentiment towards leisure travel 
in  we experienced lower cruise ticket prices due to consumer apprehension towards travel prior to and during the war in iraq and economic uncertainty 
occupancy in was compared to in gross yields increased in compared to primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net yields 
onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of million and million in and  respectively  which increased in primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net revenues

the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily attributed to increases in fuel prices  marketing  selling and administrative expenses  crew salaries and medical expenses  port expenses and costs associated with hurricanes 
the weighted average fuel price net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements for the year ended december  increased per metric ton from the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenues  fuel costs were and for and  respectively 
the increase in marketing  selling and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in general and administrative costs associated with the expansion of our reservations and sales force and additional information technology projects 
in addition  advertising costs increased primarily due to an increase in television media spending and the launch of the cirque du soleil and xpeditions marketing campaigns for celebrity cruises 
the increase in port expenses was primarily attributed to itinerary changes 
in  we incurred approximately million in costs related to the impact of hurricanes 
in  other operating expenses were reduced by approximately million in connection with a litigation settlement 
gross cruise costs per apcd increased in compared to primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net cruise costs per apcd 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation associated with the full year effect of the addition of two new ships in and one new ship in other income expense gross interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a higher average debt level and higher interest rates 
interest capitalized during decreased to million from million in due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction

the increase in capacity was primarily associated with the full year effect of the additions of constellation  brilliance of the seas and navigator of the seas in and the addition of two new ships in the increase in capacity was partially offset by the cancellation of days of sailings in due to unscheduled drydocks and the transfer of viking serenade to island cruises  our joint venture with first choice holidays plc  in the decrease in net yields was primarily due to lower cruise ticket prices and occupancy levels attributable to consumer apprehension towards travel prior to and during the war in iraq and economic uncertainty 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net onboard and other revenues due to the assumption of certain onboard functions previously handled by a concessionaire 
occupancy in was compared to in gross yields decreased in compared to primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net yields 
onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of million and million in and  respectively  which increased in primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net revenues

the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily attributed to the assumption of certain onboard functions previously handled by a concessionaire  fuel prices  the full year impact of the brilliance of the seas lease payments and new initiatives associated with the celebrity cruises marketing campaign 
the change in the concession arrangement resulted in higher payroll and related expenses and onboard and other expenses  partially offset by a decrease in food costs 
fuel costs as a percentage of total revenues were and for and  respectively 
the increase in net cruise costs per apcd in was further impacted by the fact that reflected lower spending levels as a result of business decisions taken subsequent to the events of september  in addition  included in other operating expenses in was a charge of million recorded in connection with a litigation settlement 
in  we reduced the amount of the charge by approximately million based on the actual number of claims filed 
gross cruise costs per apcd increased in compared to primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net cruise costs per apcd 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation associated with the full year effect of the addition of two new ships in and two new ships in other income expense gross interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates 
interest capitalized during decreased to million from million in due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction and lower interest rates

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash net cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared to billion in both and the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net income 
when comparing to  the decrease in net income was partially offset by an increase in customer deposits due to the timing of cash receipts 
during the year ended december   our capital expenditures were approximately billion compared to approximately billion in and billion in capital expenditures were primarily related to the deliveries of jewel of the seas in  serenade of the seas and mariner of the seas in  and constellation and navigator of the seas in  as well as progress payments for ships under construction in all years 
interest capitalized during decreased to million from million in and million in due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction 
during  we drew million on an unsecured variable rate term loan due through during  we received net cash proceeds of million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes due through during  we obtained financing of million related to the acquisition of constellation 
see note long term debt to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  we financed the addition of brilliance of the seas to our fleet by novating our original ship building contract and entering into an operating lease denominated in british pound sterling 
in connection with the novation of the contract  we received million for reimbursement of shipyard deposits previously made 
see note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
we made principal payments totaling approximately million  million and million under various term loans  senior notes  revolving credit facilities and capital leases during  and  respectively 
during  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in connection with the exercise of common stock options and we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock totaling million  million and million  respectively 
future capital commitments as of december   we had two freedom class ships on order for an additional capacity of approximately  berths with scheduled deliveries in the second quarters of and the estimated aggregate cost of the ships is approximately billion  of which we have deposited million as of december  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we anticipate total capital expenditures  including the two freedom class ships on order  will be approximately billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations ship purchase obligations other total amounts exclude interest  except for the accreted value of our zero coupon convertible notes and liquid yield option notes 
the million accreted value of the zero coupon convertible notes at december  is included in the three to five years category 
the million accreted value of the liquid yield option notes at december  is included in the more than five years category 
the holders of our zero coupon convertible notes and our liquid yield option notes may require us to purchase any notes outstanding at an accreted value of million on may  and million on february   respectively 
these accreted values were calculated based on the number of notes outstanding at december  we may choose to pay any amounts in cash or common stock or a combination thereof 
we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases primarily for a ship  offices  warehouses  computer equipment and motor vehicles 
under the brilliance of the seas lease agreement  we may be required to make a termination payment of approximately million  or approximately million based on the exchange rate at december   if the lease is canceled in this amount is included in more than years category see note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent contractual obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 
amounts represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities  marine consumables  services and maintenance contracts 
our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of operating lease commitments as discussed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
under the brilliance of the seas operating lease  we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its after tax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates and capital allowance deductions 
these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments 
we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in such lease payments due to the various circumstances  timing or combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications 
under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification is probable 
some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur 
these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes  increased lender capital costs and other similar costs 
the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business 
there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments  if any  under these indemnification clauses 
we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and  under current circumstances  we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable 
as a normal part of our business  depending on market conditions  pricing and our overall growth strategy  we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships 
we may also consider the sale of ships 
we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances 
if any of these were to occur  they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 
funding sources as of december   our liquidity was billion consisting of approximately billion in cash and cash equivalents and billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
see note long term debt to our consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments will be funded through a combination of cash flows from operations  drawdowns under our available credit facility  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets 
there can be no assurances that cash flows from operations and additional financing from external sources will be available in accordance with our expectations 
our financing agreements contain covenants that require us  among other things  to maintain minimum net worth  and fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our debt to capital ratio 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  if a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates  our two principal shareholders  cease to own a specified percentage of our common stock  we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities  which we may be unable to replace on similar terms 
if this were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 
we believe our existing credit facility  cash flows from operations  our ability to obtain new borrowings and or raise new capital or a combination of these sources will be sufficient to fund operations  debt payment requirements and capital expenditures over the next twelve month period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and other general we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices 
we minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies 
the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged 
we achieve this by closely matching the amount  term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses 
see note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas 
at december   of our debt was effectively fixed and was floating 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 
market risk associated with our long term fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates 
at december   our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed million of fixed rate debt with a weighted average fixed rate of to libor based floating rate debt 
the estimated fair value of our long term fixed rate debt at december   excluding our liquid yield option notes and zero coupon convertible notes  was billion using quoted market prices  where available  or using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities 
the fair value of our associated interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be million as of december  based on quoted market prices for similar or identical financial instruments to those we hold 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december  would increase the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt  excluding our liquid yield option notes and zero coupon convertible notes  by approximately million  net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 
market risk associated with our long term floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately million 
at december   we have an interest rate swap agreement that effectively changes million of libor based floating rate debt to fixed rate debt of beginning january market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates 
as of january  we have effectively changed of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weighted average rate of through a combination of interest rate swap agreements and rate fixings with the lessor 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our rent expense by approximately million  based on the exchange rate at december   net of the effect of interest rate swaps 
convertible notes the estimated fair values of our liquid yield option notes and zero coupon convertible notes fluctuate with the price of our common stock and at december  were million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease or increase in our december  common stock price would decrease or increase the value of our liquid yield option notes and zero coupon convertible notes by approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our firm commitments under ship construction contracts including a ship lengthening contract  denominated in euros 
we entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage this risk 
the estimated fair value of such euro denominated forward contracts at december   was a net unrealized gain of approximately million  based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities 
these euro denominated forward contracts mature through at december   approximately of the cost of the ship construction contracts was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
a hypothetical strengthening of the euro as of december   assuming no changes in comparative interest rates  would result in a million increase in the united states dollar value of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts 
this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our euro denominated forward contracts of approximately million 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the united states dollar value of our foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions 
to manage this exposure  we take advantage of any natural offsets of our foreign currency revenues and expenses and enter into foreign currency forward contracts and or option contracts for a portion of the remaining exposure related to these forecasted transactions 
our principal net foreign currency exposure relates to the euro  the norwegian kroner  british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
at december   the estimated fair value of such contracts was an unrealized loss of approximately million based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities 
a hypothetical strengthening of the principal foreign currencies as of december   assuming no changes in comparative interest rates  would result in a million increase in the united states dollar value of the foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions 
this increase would be offset by a decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts of approximately million 
fuel price risk our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships 
fuel cost  as a percentage of our total revenues  was approximately in  in and in historically  we have used fuel swap agreements and zero cost collars to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 
as of december   we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million  maturing through the estimated fair value of these contracts at december  was an unrealized gain of million 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in our weighted average fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december  would increase our fuel cost by approximately million 
this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of approximately million
