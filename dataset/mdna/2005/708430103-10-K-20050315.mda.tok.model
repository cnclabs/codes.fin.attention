item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations net interest income net interest income is determined by calculating the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
to compare the tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to taxable equivalents based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
the tax equivalent adjustments to net interest income for   and were   and  respectively

on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income increased or  to  in a period when both average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities increased 
the increase of taxable security income of  is due to the purchases of us government agency securities over the past year  with the average of these securities increasing  while the decrease in the average of tax exempt state political securities decreased tax equivalent interest income  the investment portfolio has been repositioned from longer term assets to shorter term assets to take advantage of the cash flow opportunities for reinvestment in anticipation of rising rates 
the net growth in the volume of the loan portfolio has generated additional interest income that has offset the basis point decline in the overall portfolios weighted average interest rate 
within the loan portfolio  a basis point decrease of the tax equivalent return on loans was offset by an increase of  in the average balance of loans when comparing the year to the year for the year ended december   reported interest expense decreased  or over the same period of lower rates on deposit accounts contributed the most substantial decrease in interest expense 
the weighted average rate on deposits declined basis points for as compared to the overall average balance of savings deposits increased  offset by a decrease in the weighted average rate for a net decrease in interest expense of  interest expense on time deposits decreased  due to both the basis point decline in the weighted average rate and the decrease in the average balance of  during  the company borrowed an additional million in long term advances through the fhlb to minimize future borrowing costs and to enhance liability positioning 
these additional borrowings were utilized by management to fund the substantial loan growth of the  increase in expense on long term borrowings is the result of average balances of long term fhlb borrowings increasing  partially offset by the basis point decline in the resulting weighted average interest rate for the year ending december  compared to the same period in interest paid on short term borrowings increased  as a result of an increase of the average balances outstanding during the year of  offset partially by a decline in the weighted average interest rate of basis points 
the opportunity to borrow from the federal home loan bank at historically low interest rates was utilized to assist the funding of the loan portfolio growth and is attributed to the increase of interest expense paid on borrowings 
vs reported net interest income increased  or from year end to year end the decrease in total interest income of  is the result of an increase of  in the average balance of investment securities held for the current period relative to the same period a year ago offset by a decrease in the return on loans of approximately basis points 
overall  interest income generated from the net increase in volume of interest earning assets was offset by a decline in rates of approximately basis points 
on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income increased or  to  in a period when both average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities increased 
the increase of taxable security income of  is due to the significant purchase of us government securities over the past year  with the average of these securities increasing  while the decrease in the average of tax exempt state political securities decreased tax equivalent interest income  the investment portfolio has been repositioned from longer term assets to shorter term assets to take advantage of the cash flow opportunities for reinvestment in anticipation of rising rates 
the net growth in the volume of investment holdings has generated additional interest income that has offset the basis point decline in the overall portfolios weighted average interest rates 
within the loan portfolio  a basis point decrease in the tax equivalent return on loans was partially offset by an increase of  in the average balance of loans when comparing the year to the year variable rate loans within the portfolio and other new loan originations at lower effective rates aided in the reduction of new income compared to a year ago because of the historically low rates 
for the year ended december   reported interest expense decreased  or over the same period of lower rates for all deposit accounts contribute the most substantial decrease in interest expense 
the weighted average rate on interest paid on deposits declined basis points for the year as compared to the overall average balance of savings deposits increased  offset by a decrease in the weighted average rate for a net decrease in the related interest expense of  interest expense on time deposits decreased  due to both the basis point decline in the weighted average rate and the decrease in the average balance of  favorable long term borrowing rates offer opportunities to reduce interest expenses over the coming years 
throughout  the company borrowed an additional million in long term advances through the fhlb to minimize future borrowing costs and to enhance liability positioning 
these additional borrowings were utilized by management to take advantage of current investment opportunities while minimizing interest rate risk 
the  increase in expense on long term borrowings is the result of these additional advances with average balances of  partially offset by the basis point decline in the resulting weighted average interest rate for the year ending december  compared to the same period in interest paid on short term borrowings decreased  as a result of an overall decline in the weighted average interest rate of basis points while the average balances outstanding during the year increased  the increase in short term borrowings is the result of taking advantage of the opportunity to borrow from federal home loan bank at historically low rates

gross loans increased by  from  at december  to  at december  non accruing loans decreased  from year end overall nonperforming loans decreased  to  from fiscal year end based on management s loan by loan review  the past performance of the borrowers and current economic conditions  including recent business closures and bankruptcy levels  management does not anticipate any current losses related to non accrual  non performing  or classified loans that have already been considered in its overall judgment of the adequacy of the reserve 
the following table presents information concerning nonperforming loans 
the accrual of interest will be discontinued when the principal or interest of a loan is in default for days or more  or as soon as payment is questionable  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
consumer loans and residential real estate loans secured by to family dwellings shall ordinarily not be subject to those guidelines 
the reversal of previously accrued but uncollected interest applicable to any loan placed in a non accrual status and the treatment of subsequent payments of either principal or interest will be handled in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles do not require a write off of previously accrued interest if principal and interest are ultimately protected by sound collateral values 
a nonperforming loan may be restored to an accruing status when principal and interest is no longer due and unpaid 
it becomes well secured and in the process of collection 
prospects for future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
total nonperforming loans in thousands nonaccrual days past due still accruing if interest had been recorded at the original rate on those loans  such income would have approximated   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
interest income on such loans  which is recorded as received  amounted to approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of non accruing loans continues to fluctuate annually and is attributed to the various economic factors experienced both regionally and nationally 
overall the portfolio is well secured with a majority of the balance making regular payments or scheduled to be satisfied in the near future 
presently there are no significant amounts of loans where serious doubts exist as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the current loan payment terms which are not included in the nonperforming categories as indicated above

shareholders equity is evaluated in relation to total assets and the risks associated with those assets 
a company is more likely to meet its cash obligations and absorb unforeseen losses when the capital resources are greater 
total shareholders equity at december  was  an increase of  from the balance at december  of  net income and the exercising of stock options contributed  and  respectively  to shareholders equity 
the unrealized appreciation on securities also added  to total equity 
the increases in shareholders equity were offset by  in dividends to shareholders 
bank regulators have risk based capital guidelines 
under these guidelines  banks are required to maintain minimum ratios of core capital and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items 
at december   the company s required ratios were well above the minimum ratios as follows company minimum standards tier capital ratio total capital ratio for a more comprehensive discussion of these requirements  see regulations and supervision on the form k 
management believes that the company will continue to exceed regulatory capital requirements 
return on equity and assets the ratio of net income to average total assets and average shareholders equity and certain ratios are presented as follows percentage of net income to average total assets average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared per common share percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and market risk fundamental objectives of the company s asset liability management process are to maintain adequate liquidity while minimizing interest rate risk 
the maintenance of adequate liquidity provides the company with the ability to meet its financial obligations to depositors  loan customers and shareholders 
additionally  it provides funds for normal operating expenditures and business opportunities as they arise 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to increase net interest income by managing interest sensitive assets and liabilities in such a way that they can be repriced in response to changes in market interest rates 
the company  like other financial institutions  must have sufficient funds available to meet its liquidity needs for deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
in order to control cash flow  the bank estimates future flows of cash from deposits and loan payments 
the primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  as well as federal home loan bank borrowings 
funds generated are used principally to fund loans and purchase investment securities 
management believes the company has adequate resources to meet its normal funding requirements 
management monitors the company s liquidity on both a long and short term basis thereby  providing management necessary information to react to current balance sheet trends 
cash flow needs are assessed and sources of funds are determined 
funding strategies consider both customer needs and economical cost 
both short and long term funding needs are addressed by maturities and sales of available for sale investment securities  loan repayments and maturities  and liquidating money market investments such as federal funds sold 
the use of these resources  in conjunction with access to credit provides core ingredients to satisfy depositor  borrower and creditor needs 
management monitors and determines the desirable level of liquidity 
consideration is given to loan demand  investment opportunities  deposit pricing and growth potential as well as the current cost of borrowing funds 
the company has a current borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of  in addition to this credit arrangement the company has additional lines of credit with correspondent banks of  the company s management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy estimated short term and long term funding needs 
federal home loan bank advances totaled  as of december  the bank borrowed an additional  in fhlb long term borrowings in to supplement the securities proceeds to fund loan growth 
interest rate sensitivity  which is closely related to liquidity management  is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
asset liability management strives to match maturities and rates between loan and investment security assets with the deposit liabilities and borrowings that fund them 
successful asset liability management results in a balance sheet structure which can cope effectively with market rate fluctuations 
the matching process is affected by segmenting both assets and liabilities into future time periods usually months  or less based upon when repricing can be effected 
repriceable assets are subtracted from repriceable liabilities  for a specific time period to determine the gap  or difference 
once known  the gap is managed based on predictions about future market interest rates 
intentional mismatching  or gapping  can enhance net interest income if market rates move as predicted 
however  if market rates behave in a manner contrary to predictions  net interest income will suffer 
gaps  therefore  contain an element of risk and must be prudently managed 
in addition to gap management  the company has an asset liability management policy which incorporates a market value at risk calculation which is used to determine the effects of interest rate movements on shareholders equity and a simulation analysis to monitor the effects of interest rate changes on the company s balance sheets 
interest rate sensitivity in this analysis the company examines the result of a and basis point change in market interest rates and the effect on net interest income 
it is assumed that the change is instantaneous and that all rates move in a parallel manner 
assumptions are also made concerning prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage securities 
the following is a rate shock analysis for the period indicated december  changes in rates net interest income change after tax in thousands the model utilized to create the report presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flow from principal repayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and or call activity on investment securities 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change 
in addition  the limits stated above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change 
generally  management believes the company is well positioned to respond expeditiously when the market interest rate outlook changes 
inflation the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is primarily monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates rather than inflation have a more significant impact on the company s performance 
interest rates are not always affected in the same direction or magnitude as prices of other goods and services  but are reflective of fiscal policy initiatives or economic factors that are not measured by a price index 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
the accounting policies are described in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description or our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
other than temporary impairment of equity securities equity securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary  management utilized criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reason underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary  the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known  and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  refer to note of notes and consolidated finanical statements of the form k 
goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company must assess goodwill and other intangible assets each year for impairment 
this assessment involves estimating cash flows for future periods 
if the future cash flows were less than the recorded goodwill and other intangible assets balances  we would be required to take a charge against earnings to write down the assets to the lower value 
deferred tax assets we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
our deferred tax assets are described further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the corporation has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations which may require future cash payments 
the following table presents in thousands  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements
