item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december    and in addition  this section contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are described in the investment considerations section on page 
table of contents critical accounting policies the sec has recently issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include valuation of loans  evaluation of the recoverability of accounts receivable and income tax assets  and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although the company believes that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december   are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
general the company is a specialty finance company that has a leading position in originating and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses 
since  the year in which the company became a public company  it has increased its medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of  and its commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 
total assets under our management  which includes assets serviced for third party investors  were approximately  at december   and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of from  at the end of the company s loan related earnings depend primarily on its level of net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the total yield on the company s loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds 
the company funds its operations through a wide variety of interest bearing sources  such as revolving bank facilities  bank certificates of deposit issued to customers  debentures issued to and guaranteed by the sba  and bank term debt 
net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on the company s loan portfolio and changes in the cost of borrowed funds  as well as changes in the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities held by the company 
net interest income is also affected by economic  regulatory  and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand  and the availability of funding to finance the company s lending activities 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice on a different basis than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company also invests in small businesses in selected industries through its subsidiary mci 
mci s investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest income is earned on the debt investments 
realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off 
the realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets  if any  and the cost of such portfolio assets 
in addition  changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period 
generally  realized gains losses on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments are inversely related 
when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs 
conversely  when a loss previously recorded as unrealized depreciation is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes a decrease in net unrealized depreciation and an increase in realized loss 
the company s investment in mtm  as wholly owned portfolio investments  was also subject to quarterly assessments of fair value 
the company used mtm s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 

table of contents trends in investment portfolio the company s investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on its investment portfolio 
to identify trends in the yields  the portfolio is grouped by medallion loans  commercial loans  consumer loans  equity investments  and investment securities

table of contents portfolio summary total portfolio yield the weighted average yield of the total portfolio at december  was for the loan portfolio  an increase of basis points from at december   which was a decrease of basis points from at december  the increase primarily reflected the impact of the rv marine portfolio purchase and strong growth in the commercial loan portfolio  both at higher yields 
the decrease from primarily reflected the reductions in the general level of interest rates in the economy  evidenced by the reduction in the prime rate from in early to by year end the company expects to try to increase the percentage of commercial and consumer loans in the total portfolio  the origination of floating and adjustable rate loans  and the level of non new york medallion loans to enhance our yields 
medallion loan portfolio the company s medallion loans comprised of the net portfolio of  at december   compared to of  at december  and of  at december  the medallion loan portfolio increased by  or in  reflecting increases in most markets  particularly in new york and chicago 
the increase in the new york market can be attributed to new business marketing efforts  the conversion of participations into owned loans  the general increase in medallion values and related refinancings  and also to the recent auctions of medallions 
the increase in the chicago market primarily reflects efforts to increase our market share in this higher yielding market and the conversion of owned medallions into earning assets 
total medallion loans serviced for third parties were   and  at december    and the weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was a decrease of basis points from at december  the decreases in yield primarily reflected the generally lower level of interest rates in the economy  and the effects of borrower refinancings 
at december   of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york  compared to and at year end and the company continues to focus its efforts on originating higher yielding medallion loans outside the new york market 
commercial loan portfolio since  and until  the company shifted the total portfolio mix toward a higher percentage of commercial loans  which historically had higher yields than medallion loans  and represented of the net investment portfolio as of december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
commercial loans increased by  or during primarily reflecting increased loan originations in the asset based and mezzanine loan portfolios  and the repurchase of participated commercial loans in the asset based loan portfolio  since the removal of liquidity constraints in mid year total commercial loans serviced for third parties were   and  at december    and  and included   and  respectively  related to the sba section a business 
the weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at december  was  an increase of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the increase in was primarily due to the higher origination volume in the high yielding mezzanine loan portfolio  partially offset by increased customer refinancing activities at lower rates 
the decrease in reflected downward repricing pressure consistent with the interest rate drops over the last few years 
the company continues to originate adjustable rate and floating rate loans tied to the prime rate to help mitigate its interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
at december   variable rate loans represented approximately of the commercial portfolio  compared to and at december  and although this strategy initially produces a lower yield  we believe that this strategy mitigates interest rate risk by better matching our earning assets to their adjustable rate funding sources 
consumer loan portfolios the company s consumer loans represented of the net investment portfolio as of december  the existing portfolio was purchased on april  from an unrelated financial institution and the transaction closed may  the loans are collateralized by recreational vehicles  boats  and horse trailers located in all states 
the portfolio is serviced by a third party subsidiary of a major commercial bank

the company started originating new adjustable rate rv marine loans in states during the third quarter 
delinquency and loan loss experience we generally follow a practice of discontinuing the accrual of interest income on our loans that are in arrears as to interest payments for a period of days or more 
we deliver a default notice and begin foreclosure and liquidation proceedings when management determines that pursuit of these remedies is the most appropriate course of action under the circumstances 
a loan is considered to be delinquent if the borrower fails to make a payment on time  however  during the course of discussion on delinquent status  we may agree to modify the payment terms of the loan with a borrower that cannot make payments in accordance with the original loan agreement 
for loan modifications  the loan will only be returned to accrual status if all past due interest payments are brought fully current 
for credit that is collateral based  we evaluate the anticipated net residual value we would receive upon foreclosure of such loans  if necessary 
there can be no assurance  however  that the collateral securing these loans will be adequate in the event of foreclosure 
for credit that is cash flow based  we assess our collateral position  and evaluate most of these relationships on an enterprise value basis  expecting to locate and install a new operator to run the business and reduce the debt 
for the consumer loan portfolio  the process to repossess the collateral is started at days past due 
if the collateral is not located and the account reaches days delinquent  the account is charged off to realized losses 
if the collateral is repossessed  a realized loss is recorded to write the loan down to of its net realizable value  and the collateral is sent to auction 
when the collateral is sold  the net auction proceeds are applied to the account  and any remaining balance is written off as a realized loss  and any excess proceeds are recorded as a realized gain 
proceeds collected on charged off accounts are recorded as a realized gain 
all collection  repossession  and recovery efforts are handled on behalf of mb by the servicer 
the following table shows the trend in loans days or more past due as of december  medallion loans commercial loans secured mezzanine sba section a asset based receivable other secured commercial total commercial loans total consumer loans total loans days or more past due percentage is calculated against the total loan portfolio 
in general  collection efforts during the past three years since the establishment of our collection department have substantially contributed to the sizable reduction in overall delinquencies 
the increase in medallion delinquencies from was concentrated in the chicago medallion portfolio  is viewed as a temporary spike  and on a percentage basis  remains at a relatively low historical level 
the increase in secured mezzanine financing delinquencies primarily reflected the impact of the economy on certain concession and media properties  some of which is believed to be of temporary nature  and is not unusual given the nature of this kind of business and the current stage of the economic cycle 
the decrease from primarily reflected the conversion of a  loan into an equity position in a portfolio investment  and chargeoffs taken 
the continued improvement in the trend of delinquencies in the sba section a portfolio  and the relatively low level of delinquencies in the other commercial secured loan portfolio primarily reflected management s efforts to collect and restructure nonperforming loans  and the foreclosure of certain loans  transferring them to other assets 
included in the sba section a delinquency figures are   and  at december    and  which represented loans repurchased for the purpose of collecting on the sba guarantee 
the company is actively working with 
table of contents each delinquent borrower to bring them current  and believes that any potential loss exposure is reflected in the company s mark to market estimates on each loan 
although there can be no assurances as to changes in the trend rate  management believes that any loss exposures are properly reflected in reported asset values 
we monitor delinquent loans for possible exposure to loss by analyzing various factors  including the value of the collateral securing the loan and the borrower s prior payment history 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the valuation of our portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our portfolio  management and the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  management and the board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of long term  fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values that approximate that which would have been established by market forces  and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
based upon these factors  net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is determined  or the amount by which our estimate of the current realizable value of our portfolio is above or below our cost basis

equity investments equity investments were   and  of the company s total portfolio at december    and equity investments are comprised of common stock and warrants 
the increase in equity investments during primarily reflected the receipt of  shares of common stock of ccu in a tax free exchange for of our ownership interest in media 
the increase in equity cost from primarily reflected the conversion of a  loan into an equity position in a portfolio investment  and the reduction in the overall equities position during reflected the sale of a publicly traded investment 

table of contents investment securities investment securities were of the company s total portfolio at december   and represent a new investment category as of the first quarter 
the investment securities are primarily adjustable rate mortgage backed securities purchased by mb to better utilize required cash liquidity 
investment in and loans to mtm the investments and loans to mtm represent the company s investment in its taxicab advertising business  including contributed capital  the company s share of accumulated losses  and intercompany loans provided to mtm for operating capital 
these investments were sold in their entirety during the third quarter 
trend in interest expense the company s interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on its short term credit facilities with banks  bank certificates of deposit  fixed rate  long term debentures issued to the sba  and other short term notes payable 
the establishment of the merrill lynch bank  usa mlb line of credit in september and its favorable renegotiation in september had the effect of substantially reducing the company s cost of funds 
in addition  mb began raising brokered bank certificates of deposit during  which were at the company s lowest borrowing costs 
as a result of mb raising funds through certificates of deposits as previously noted  the company was able to realign the ownership of some of its medallions and related assets to mb allowing the company and its subsidiaries to use cash generated through these transactions to retire debt with higher interest rates 
during the third quarter  the trust closed a  line of credit with mlb for lending on medallion loans  which was priced at libor plus  excluding fees and other costs 
all of the draws on this line were paid to mfc for medallion loans purchased  and were used by mfc to repay higher priced debt with the banks and noteholders  and to purchase loans for the trust from participants and affiliates 
during the third quarter  this line was renewed and extended  and borrowings were now generally at libor plus 
in addition   of higher priced sba debentures were repaid during  and  was drawn back at lower borrowing rates 
the september  amendments repriced the bank loans to for the company and for mfc  and repriced mfc s senior secured notes to 
in addition to the interest rate charges  approximately  had been incurred through december  for attorneys and other professional advisors  most working on behalf of the lenders  and for prepayment penalties and default interest charges  of which   and  was expensed as part of costs of debt extinguishment    and  was expensed as part of interest expense  and   and  was expensed as part of professional fees in   and  respectively 
the balance of  which relates solely to the mlb line  will be charged to interest expense over the remaining term of the line of credit 
the company s cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on its various debt instruments and their relative mix  and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of all outstanding debt 
the company s debentures issued to the sba typically have terms of ten years 
the company measures its borrowing costs as its aggregate interest expense for all of its interest bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period 
the following table shows the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for   and average balances have increased from a year ago  primarily reflecting the establishment of mb and its resulting growth  and the funding needs to support the growth in the company s other investment portfolios 
the decline in borrowing costs reflected the utilization of the lower cost revolving line of credit with mlb  the raising of low cost deposits by mb  and the trend of declining interest rates in the economy  partially offset by higher cost bank debt and related renewal expenses  and additional long term sba debt also at higher rates 

table of contents interest expense average balance average borrowing costs december  floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings total december  floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings total december  floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings total included in interest expense in was  of interest reversals 
adjusted for this amount  the floating rate borrowings average borrowing costs would have been  and the total average borrowing costs would have been 
the company will continue to seek sba funding to the extent it offers attractive rates 
sba financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur 
the company uses sba funding to fund loans that qualify under sbia and sba regulations 
the company believes that financing operations primarily with short term floating rate secured bank debt has generally decreased its interest expense  but has also increased the company s exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates  which the company mitigates with certain hedging strategies 
at december    and  short term floating rate debt constituted   and of total debt  respectively 
the decrease in reflects the issuance of bank certificates of deposit by mb  that are primarily of a short term nature 
taxicab advertising in addition to its finance business  the company also conducted a taxicab rooftop advertising business primarily through media  which began operations in november  and ceased operations upon the merger of media with and into a subsidiary of ccu  and the sale of mmj to its management 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
although media was a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  its results of operations were not consolidated with the company s operations because sec regulations prohibit the consolidation of non investment companies with investment companies 
during the last three years  media s operations were constrained by a very difficult advertising environment that resulted from the september  terrorist attacks and a general economic downturn  compounded by the rapid expansion of taxicab tops inventory that occurred during and media began to recognize losses as growth in operating expenses exceeded growth in revenue 
in july  through its subsidiary mmj  the company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a taxi advertising operation similar to those operated by media in the us  which had advertising rights on approximately  cabs servicing various cities in japan 
the terms of the agreement provided for an earn out payment to the sellers based on average net income over the next three years 
mmj accounted for approximately   and of mtm s combined revenue during   and factors affecting net assets factors that affect the company s net assets include net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments 
net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment 
change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the amount  if any  by which the company s estimate of the fair value of its investment portfolio is above or below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio 
under the act and the sbia  the company s loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value 

table of contents unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses  but adjusts quarterly the valuation of the loan portfolio to reflect the company s estimate of the current value of the total loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for the company s loans  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of the company 
in determining such fair value  the company and its board of directors consider factors such as the financial condition of its borrowers and the adequacy of its collateral 
any change in the fair value of portfolio loans or other investments as determined by the company is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation of investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income 
the company s investment in mtm  as wholly owned portfolio investments  were also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company used mtm s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and net increase in net assets resulting from operations was  or per diluted common share in  up  from  or per share in  primarily reflecting the unrealized appreciation associated with the exchange of our investment in media for ccu stock and the increased net interest income resulting from the rv marine portfolio purchase  partially offset by higher taxes and higher operating expenses associated with servicing those acquired assets  and the realized gains associated with the sale of select comfort

asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion  commercial  and consumer loans  and investment securities reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of credit facilities with banks  bank certificates of deposit  and subordinated sba debentures 
having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  the company anticipates that approximately of the taxicab medallion portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
the company believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
however  borrowers may prepay for a variety of other reasons  such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values  particularly in the medallion loan portfolio 
in addition  the company manages its exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  such as ten year subordinated sba debentures  and by setting repricing intervals or the maturities of tranches drawn under the revolving line of credit or issued as certificates of deposit  for terms of up to five years 
the company had outstanding sba debentures of  with a weighted average interest rate of  constituting of the company s total indebtedness as of december  also  as of december   portions of the adjustable rate debt with banks repriced at intervals of as long as months  and certain of the certificates of deposit were for terms of up to months  further mitigating the immediate impact of changes in market interest rates 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities  and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 

table of contents the following table presents the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december   compared to the respective positions at the end of and the principal amount of medallion loans and commercial loans are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be repriced 
the company has not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for medallion loans or commercial loans in this table

the company s interest rate sensitive assets were  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were  at december  the one year cumulative interest rate gap was a positive  or of interest rate sensitive assets  compared to a negative  or at december  however  using our estimated prepayment refinancing rate for medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a positive gap of  or at december  the company seeks to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans  by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  by evaluating appropriate derivatives  pursuing securitization opportunities  and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk 
interest rate cap agreements from time to time  the company enters into interest rate cap agreements to manage the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by hedging a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of  limiting our maximum libor exposure on our revolving credit facility until june  to 
total premiums paid under interest rate cap agreements were expensed  and there were no interest rate caps outstanding as of december  liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity are the revolving line of credit with mlb  unfunded commitments from the sba for long term debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  loan amortization and prepayments  participations or sales of loans to third parties  and our ability to raise brokered certificates of deposit through mb 
as a ric in and earlier years  
table of contents and as expected for and later years  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we have primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in september  the trust entered into a  revolving line of credit with mlb for the purpose of funding medallion loans acquired from mfc and others 
at december   this line was essentially fully utilized  however in january  the line was extended and the commitment amount raised to  and can be increased to  at our option 
at the current required capital levels  it is expected  although there can be no guarantee  that deposits of approximately  could be raised by mb to fund future loan origination activity 
in addition  mb as a non ric subsidiary of the company is allowed and for three years required to retain all earnings in the business to fund future growth 
in may  the company applied for and received  of additional funding with the sba  to be committed by the sba in total  subject to the infusion of additional equity capital into the respective subsidiaries  and in december  an additional  of funding was committed by the sba  free from any additional equity capital contribution 
at december    is available under these commitments  of which requires a capital contribution from the company of   of which requires no capital contribution 
since sba financing subjects its recipients to certain regulations  the company will seek funding at the subsidiary level to maximize its benefits 
lastly  approximately  was available at december  under a loan sale agreement that mbc has with a participant bank  and  was available under a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank 
the components of our debt were as follows at december  balance percentage rate revolving line of credit certificates of deposit sba debentures notes payable to banks margin loan total outstanding debt weighted average contractual rate as of december  the company s contractual obligations expire on or mature at various dates through march  the following table shows all contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than year years years years years more than years total floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings operating lease obligations total the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by the board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
the company records unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s equity investment has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect management s estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
the company s investment in mtm  as wholly owned portfolio investments  was also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company used mtm s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 

table of contents in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent by term fixed rate debt we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have positively impacted net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations as of at december  by approximately  on an annualized basis  compared to  as of december   and the impact of such an immediate change over a one year period would have been  compared to  for although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates 
the company continues to work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include  among others  the sale or spin off certain assets or divisions  the development of a securitization conduit program  and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes 
these financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth

reflects the federally insured certificates of deposit issued by mb during its first full year of operations 
loan amortization  prepayments  and sales also provide a source of funding for the company 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  medallion loan market rates  economic conditions  and competition 
loan sales are a major focus of the sba section a loan program conducted by bll  which is primarily set up to originate and sell loans 
increases in sba section a loan balances in any given period generally reflect timing differences in closing and selling transactions 
the company believes that its credit facilities with mlb and the sba  deposits generated at mb  and cash flow from operations after distributions to shareholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio 
also  mb is not a ric  and therefore is able to retain earnings to finance growth

at december  investment considerations interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates which adjust at various intervals  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with adjustable or floating interest rates which adjust immediately to changes in rates 
as a result  our debt may adjust to a change in interest rates more quickly than the loans in our portfolio 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our costs of funds would increase  which would reduce our portfolio income before net realized and unrealized gains 
accordingly  like most financial services companies  we face the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate caps  to achieve a positive asset liability gap at year end  general rises in interest rates may reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
in addition  we rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such interest rate caps 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
our borrowers generally have the right to prepay their loans upon payment of a fee ranging from to days interest 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest margin we receive 
we have traditionally qualified to be a ric  and in order to be taxed as a ric we must distribute our income 
therefore  we may have a continuing need for capital if we continue to be taxed as a ric in the future 
we have a continuing need for capital to finance our lending activities 
our current sources of capital and liquidity are the following line of credit for medallion lending  raising deposits at mb  loan amortization and prepayments  sales of participation interests in loans  fixed rate  long term sba debentures that are issued to the sba  and borrowings from other financial intermediaries 
in order to be taxed as a ric in and earlier years  and as expected for and later years  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we have primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
at december   we had  available under outstanding commitments from the sba   available under a loan sale agreement with a participant bank   of additional deposits can be raised by mb at existing capital levels  and  is available under a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank 
in addition  in january  our revolving line of credit with mlb was increased to  and extended until september  with an option to increase the line to  at our choice  increasing availability under the line by  and  respectively 

table of contents we may have difficulty raising capital to finance our planned level of lending operations 
although the company has demonstrated an ability to meet significant debt amortization requirements in the past  received approval to operate mb and begin raising federally insured deposits  and has several refinancing options in progress and under consideration  there can be no assurance that additional funding sources to meet amortization requirements or future growth targets will be successfully obtained 
see the additional discussion related to the credit facilities and note agreements in the liquidity and capital resources section on page due to the company s late filing of this form k  the company could have restrictions imposed on it by rules of nasdaq and the sec

lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to achieve financing from traditional sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
our borrowers may default on their loans 
we primarily invest in and lend to companies that may have limited financial resources 
numerous factors may affect a borrower s ability to repay its loan  including the failure to meet its business plan  a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions  the death  disability or resignation of one or more of the key members of management  or the inability to obtain additional financing from traditional sources 
deterioration of a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration of the collateral for the loan 
expansion of our portfolio and increases in the proportion of our portfolio consisting of commercial loans could have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the portfolio 
we borrow money  which may increase the risk of investing in our common stock 
we use financial leverage through banks and our long term subordinated sba debentures 
leverage poses certain risks for our stockholders  including the following it may result in higher volatility of both our net asset value and the market price of our common stock  since interest is paid to our creditors before any income is distributed to our stockholders  fluctuations in the interest payable to our creditors may decrease the dividends and distributions to our stockholders  and in the event of a liquidation of the company  our creditors would have claims on our assets superior to the claims of our stockholders 
our failure to remedy certain internal control deficiencies at our bll subsidiary could have an adverse affect on our business operations 
the company s bll subsidiary has been operating under an agreement with the state of connecticut to  among other things  improve bll s liquidity and capital ratios  correct certain operational weaknesses  improve the quality of assets  and increase the level of valuation allowances  the latter of which has already been reflected in these financial statements 
the board of directors of bll has entered into an agreement to address these areas of concern  which are similar to those in previous reports 
there can be no assurance that bll will be able to fully comply with its provisions 
bll has historically represented less than of the profits of the company 

table of contents if we are unable to continue to diversify geographically  our business may be adversely affected if the new york city taxicab industry experiences a sustained economic downturn 
although we have diversified from the new york city area  a significant portion of our loan revenue is derived from new york city medallion loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
an economic downturn in the new york city taxicab industry could lead to an increase in defaults on our medallion loans 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our operations geographically 
an economic downturn could result in certain of our commercial loan customers experiencing declines in business activities  which could lead to difficulties in their servicing of their loans with us  and increasing the level of delinquencies  defaults  and loan losses in our commercial loan portfolio 
although the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
the loss of certain key members of our senior management could adversely affect us 
our success is largely dependent upon the efforts of senior management 
the death  incapacity  or loss of the services of certain of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
there can be no assurance that other qualified officers could be hired 
acquisitions may lead to difficulties that could adversely affect our operations 
by their nature  corporate acquisitions entail certain risks  including those relating to undisclosed liabilities  the entry into new markets  operational  and personnel matters 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired operations or managing problems due to sudden increases in the size of our loan portfolio 
in such instances  we might be required to modify our operating systems and procedures  hire additional staff  obtain and integrate new equipment  and complete other tasks appropriate for the assimilation of new business activities 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful  if and when necessary  in minimizing these inherent risks or in establishing systems and procedures which will enable us to effectively achieve our desired results in respect of any future acquisitions 
competition from entities with greater resources and less regulatory restrictions may decrease our profitability 
we compete with banks  credit unions  and other finance companies  some of which are sbics  in the origination of taxicab medallion loans and commercial loans 
many of these competitors have greater resources than the company and certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than the company 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify and complete financing transactions that will permit us to continue to compete successfully 
the valuation of our loan portfolio is subjective and we may not be able to recover our estimated value in the event of a foreclosure or sale of a substantial portion of portfolio loans 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the valuation of our investment portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of our management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
if liquidity constraints required the sale of a substantial portion of the portfolio  such an action may require the sale of certain assets at amounts less than their carrying amounts 
in determining the value of our portfolio  management and the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  management and the board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values which approximate the value that would have been established by market forces and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 

table of contents considering these factors  we have determined that the fair value of our portfolio is below its cost basis 
at december   our net unrealized depreciation on investments was approximately  or of our investment portfolio 
based upon current market conditions and current loan to value ratios  management believes  and our board of directors concurs  that the net unrealized depreciation on investments is adequate to reflect the fair value of the portfolio 
changes in taxicab industry regulations that result in the issuance of additional medallions could lead to a decrease in the value of our medallion loan collateral 
every city in which we originate medallion loans  and most other major cities in the us  limits the supply of taxicab medallions 
this regulation results in supply restrictions that support the value of medallions 
actions that loosen these restrictions and result in the issuance of additional medallions into a market could decrease the value of medallions in that market 
if this were to occur  the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market could be adversely affected 
new york city determined to increase the number of medallions by  auctioned over a three year period beginning in  preceded by a fare hike 
the first of these auctions for medallions concluded in april  and the second for medallions concluded in october  and both generated high levels of bid activity and record medallion prices 
although there can be no assurances  we would expect the final auction in to obtain similar results 
we are unable to forecast with any degree of certainty whether any other potential increases in the supply of medallions will occur 
in new york city  chicago  boston  and in other markets where we originate medallion loans  taxicab fares are generally set by government agencies 
expenses associated with operating taxicabs are largely unregulated 
as a result  the ability of taxicab operators to recoup increases in expenses is limited in the short term 
escalating expenses can render taxicab operations less profitable  and could cause borrowers to default on loans from the company  and could potentially adversely affect the value of the company s collateral 
as mentioned above  new york city approved a fare increase as a part of the auction program which was effective may  a significant portion of our loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
according to new york city taxi and limousine commission data  over the past years new york city taxicab medallions have appreciated in value an average of each year 
however  for sustained periods during that time  taxicab medallions have declined in value 
during  the value of new york city taxicab medallions increased by approximately for individual medallions and for corporate medallions 
our failure to re establish our ric status in and beyond could lead to a substantial reduction in the amount of income distributed to our shareholders 
in  changes were enacted to the federal tax laws which  among other things  significantly reduced the tax rate on dividends paid to shareholders from a corporation s previously taxed income 
assuming we qualify as a ric for or subsequent taxable years  we are unable to predict the effect of such changes upon our common stock 
as noted above  we did not qualify as a ric in and  and as a result we were able to take advantage of corporate net operating loss carryforwards 
if we do not file as a ric for more than two consecutive years  and then seek to requalify and elect ric status  we would be required to recognize gain to the extent of any unrealized appreciation on our assets unless we make a special election to pay corporate level tax on any such unrealized appreciation recognized during the succeeding year period 
absent such special election  any gain we recognize would be deemed distributed to our stockholders as a taxable distribution 
prior to  we along with some of our subsidiaries qualified to be treated as rics under the code 
as rics  we generally were not subject to federal income tax on investment company taxable income which includes  among other things  interest  dividends  and capital gains reduced by deductible expenses distributed to our shareholders 
if we or those of our subsidiaries that were also rics fail to qualify as rics in or beyond  our respective income would become fully taxable and a substantial reduction in the amount of income available for distribution to us and to our shareholders could result 
to qualify and be taxed as a ric  we must meet certain income  diversification  and distribution requirements 
however  because we use leverage  we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements set forth in the act 
these asset coverage requirements could  under certain circumstances  prohibit us from making distributions that are necessary to maintain our ric status or require that we reduce our leverage 

table of contents in addition  the asset coverage and distribution requirements impose significant cash flow management restrictions on us and limit our ability to retain earnings to cover periods of loss  provide for future growth and pay for extraordinary items 
certain of our loans  including the medallion collateral appreciation participation loans  could also be re characterized in a manner that would generate non qualifying income for purposes of the ric rules 
in this event  if such income exceeds the amount permissible  we could fail to satisfy the requirement that a ric derive at least of its gross income from qualifying sources  with the result that we would not meet the requirements of subchapter m for qualification as a ric 
qualification as a ric is made on an annual basis and  although we and some of our subsidiaries qualified as regulated investment companies in the past  no assurance can be given that each will qualify for such treatment in and beyond 
failure to qualify as a ric would subject us to tax on our income and could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our sbic subsidiaries may be unable to meet the investment company requirements  which could result in the imposition of an entity level tax 
the sbia regulates some of our subsidiaries 
the sbia restricts distributions by a sbic 
our sbic subsidiaries that are also rics could be prohibited by sba regulations from making the distributions necessary to qualify as a ric 
each year  in order to comply with the sba regulations and the ric distribution requirements  we must request and receive a waiver of the sba s restrictions 
while the current policy of the sba s office of sbic operations is to grant such waivers if the sbic makes certain offsetting adjustments to its paid in capital and surplus accounts  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the sba s policy or that our subsidiaries will have adequate capital to make the required adjustments 
if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver  compliance with the sba regulations may result in loss of ric status and a consequent imposition of an entity level tax 
the internal revenue code s diversification requirements may limit our ability to expand our business 
these requirements provide that to qualify as a ric  not more than of the value of our total assets may be invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other rics of any one issuer 
while our investments in ric subsidiaries are not subject to this diversification test so long as these subsidiaries qualify as rics  our investments in ccu and mb would be subject to this test  and could impact requalification as a ric 
the merger of media into ccu in exchange for stock created a diversification issue as well  as it represents of the company s ric assets 
the level of the investment will need to be monitored to ensure it remains within the diversification guidelines 
additionally the company s investment in mb  while representing only of the company s total ric assets at december   currently falls well within the guidelines of the test described above 
however  as an anticipated future growth vehicle of the company  the investment in mb will need to be monitored for continued compliance with the test 
the fair value of the collateral appreciation participation loan portfolio at december  was  which represented of mfc s total ric assets  and the owned medallion portion was  or of total assets 
we will continue to monitor the levels of these asset types in conjunction with the diversification tests  assuming we re qualify for ric status 
our past use of arthur andersen llp as our independent auditors may pose risks to us and also limit your ability to seek potential recoveries from them related to their work 
effective july   the company dismissed its independent auditors  arthur andersen llp andersen  in view of recent developments involving andersen 
as a public company  we are required to file periodic financial statements with the sec that have been audited or reviewed by an independent accountant 
as our former independent auditors  andersen provided a report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the five fiscal years in the period ended december  sec rules require us to obtain andersen s consent to the inclusion of its audit report in our public filings 
however  andersen was indicted and found guilty of federal obstruction of justice charges  and has informed the company that it is no longer able to provide such consent as a result of the departure from andersen of the former partner and manager responsible for the audit report 
under these circumstances  rule a under the securities act of  as amended  permits the company to incorporate the audit report and the audited financial statements without obtaining the consent of andersen 

table of contents the sec has recently provided regulatory relief designed to allow public companies to dispense with the requirement that they file a consent of andersen in certain circumstances 
notwithstanding this relief  the inability of andersen to provide either its consent or customary assurance services to us now and in the future could negatively affect our ability to  among other things  access the public capital markets 
any delay or inability to access the public markets as a result of this situation could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
we are primarily a holding company  and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
as a result  we rely heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness  but there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments 
furthermore  as a condition of its approval by its regulators  mb is precluded from making any dividend payments for its first three years of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment 
we are regulated by the sec  the sba  the fdic  and the utah department of financial institutions 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations that govern bdcs  rics  sbics  or banks may significantly affect our business 
laws and regulations may be changed from time to time  and the interpretations of the relevant laws and regulations also are subject to change 
any change in the laws or regulations that govern our business could have a material impact on our operations 
our use of brokered deposit sources for mb s deposit gathering activities may not be available when needed 
mb relies on the established brokered deposit market to originate deposits to fund its operations 
while mb has developed contractual relationships with a diversified group of investment brokers  and the brokered deposit market is well developed and utilized by many banking institutions  conditions could change that might affect the availability of deposits 
if the capital levels at mb fall below the well capitalized level  or if mb experiences a period of sustained operating losses  the cost of attracting deposits from the brokered deposit market could increase significantly  and the ability of mb to raise deposits from this source could be impaired 
mb s ability to manage its growth to stay within the well capitalized level  and the capital level currently required by the fdic during mb s first three years of operation  which is also considerably higher than the level required to be classified as well capitalized  is critical to mb s retaining open access to this funding source 
consumer lending is a new product line for us that carries a higher risk of loss and could be adversely affected by an economic downturn 
the acquisition of the rv marine loan portfolio  and the subsequent commencement of lending operations in this line of business  represents an entry into the new market of consumer lending for the company 
although the purchased portfolio was seasoned  and mb management has considerable experience in originating and managing consumer loans  there can be no assurances that these loans will perform at their historical levels as expected under mb s management 
by its nature  lending to consumers that have blemishes on their credit reports carries with it a higher risk of loss 
although the net interest margins should be higher to compensate the company for this increased risk  an economic downturn could result in higher loss rates and lower returns than expected  and could affect the profitability of the consumer loan portfolio 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
the company considers the management of risk essential to conducting its businesses 
accordingly  the company s risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze the company s risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 

table of contents the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by management and approved by the board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
the company records unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect management s estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
the company s investment in mtm  as wholly owned portfolio investments  were also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company used mtm s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent with long term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected net increase decrease in net assets at december   by approximately  on an annualized basis  compared to  as of december   and the impact of such an immediate change over a one year period would have been  compared to  for although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in net assets in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates
