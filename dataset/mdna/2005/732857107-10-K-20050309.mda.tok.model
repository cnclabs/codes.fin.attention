executive overview pope resources  a delaware limited partnership we or the partnership  was organized in october as a result of a spin off by pope talbot  inc p t 
pope resources is engaged in three primary businesses 
the first  and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations  is the fee timber segment 
operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to export and domestic manufacturers 
the second most significant business in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate 
real estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits  entitlements  and  in some cases  installing infrastructure for raw land development and then realizing that land s value by the selling of larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain either to home buyers or commercial property end users 
an additional activity that we expect will become a more significant component of our real estate revenue mix is the sale of rural residential lots to end users 
these lots will involve minimal development infrastructure and will range in size from to acres 
since these land projects span multiple years  the real estate segment may incur losses for multiple years until a major project is sold resulting in operating income 
our third business is that of providing timberland related services to third parties 
these services may take the form of large scale timberland management  forestry consulting  or acquisition or disposition services 
factors affecting results from each of these segments are discussed in more detail below 
as of december   we owned over  acres of timberland in western washington state plus  acres of real estate held for sale or development 
our third party services have been historically conducted in the states of washington  oregon  and california  plus the canadian provinces of british columbia and alberta 
macroeconomic factors that have a significant bearing on our business include the following housing starts in the us and to a lesser degree in japan  interest rates  and currency exchange rates particularly those between the us and canada  japan  and europe 
the first two of these macroeconomic factors reflect or influence the health of the us housing market 
the housing market  together with the repair and remodel market  consume nearly of the log volume supplied domestically 
currency exchange rates influence the competitiveness of our primary product compared to logs that might be imported from canada  europe  or the southern hemisphere 
our export logs are sold to domestic intermediaries who then export the logs 
a favorable us yen exchange rate can help these intermediaries compete in the japanese market with logs that originate from canada  europe  or the southern hemisphere thus increasing the price that we are able to realize from the sale of this export quality log volume 
as an owner and manager of timberland  we focus keenly on three product markets the markets for logs  lumber and timberland 
each of these markets has unique and distinct market factors so that they do not move up or down in lockstep with each other 
generally  the lumber market is the most volatile as it responds quickly even daily to changing demand expectations that are housing driven and changes to lumber inventories 
log markets will in turn be affected by what is happening in the lumber spot markets  but pricing shifts typically adjust monthly rather than daily 
log price volatility is also moderated because logs are used to produce products besides just lumber especially pulp 
the market for timberland tends to be even less volatile with pricing that lags both lumber and log markets 
this is a function of the longer time horizons utilized by investors in timberland where the short swing fluctuations of log or lumber prices become stabilized in acquisition modeling 
we watch the lumber market because activity there can presage log price changes 
we are in the log market constantly as we negotiate delivery prices to our customers 
the timberland market is important as we are constantly evaluating our own portfolio and its underlying value as well as the opportunities to adjust that portfolio through either the acquisition or disposition of such land 
management s major opportunity and challenge is to profitably grow our revenue base 
we have added almost  acres over the last four years to our fee timberland portfolio including  acres during our real estate challenges center around how and when to harvest a parcel of land and capture the optimum value increment through sale 
regarding our third party timberland services  we began managing  acres of timberland in january for cascade timberlands llc and are seeking to secure additional income opportunities for this segment 
our consolidated revenues in   and  on a percentage basis by segment  are as follows segment fee timber timberland management consulting real estate further segment financial information is presented in note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report

 total change in earnings  fee timber revenue and operating income fee timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from the partnership s  acres of fee timberland located in western washington and to a lesser extent from the sale of gravel and cellular communication tower leases 
we acquired nearly  acres of timberland during in three separate transactions 
the timber on two of these transactions consisted primarily of merchantable timber  with the third property also comprising a meaningful proportion of merchantable timber 
taken together  the age class characteristics of the three acquired properties resulted in an increase in harvest volume in  and will also result in an even higher expected increase in harvest volume in revenue and operating income generated by the fee timber segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended timber revenue mineral  cell tower  and other revenue total segment revenue operating income december  million million million million december  million million million million december  million million million million fiscal year compared to fee timber revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in harvest volume increased to million board feet mmbf from mmbf for the increase in harvest volume combined with a per thousand board feet mbf increase in average price realized resulted in the increase in revenue 
operating income increased million  or  to million from million in the increase in operating income is due to the increase in revenue partially offset by increase in cost of sales and operating expenses 
the partnership regularly adjusts its timberland portfolio of holdings as part of its active management through acquisitions and dispositions of smaller parcels 
during the partnership closed three separate timberlands acquisitions representing nearly  acres of timberland 
two of the three acquisitions represented acres that were virtually all harvestable immediately 
the third acquisition parcel was a blend of merchantable and younger timber 
as a result  annual harvest levels in are expected to increase to mmbf  which is approximately mmbf over our projected annual sustainable harvest of mmbf 
assuming we do not acquire any additional timberland in  the annual harvest in is expected to return to our sustainable harvest level of mmbf 
fiscal year compared to fee timber revenue decreased  or  to million in from million in harvest volumes were essentially identical between and at mmbf 
a per mbf decline in average price realized resulted in the decline in revenue  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from small timberland sales that represented  of revenue in and  of revenue in operating income decreased  or  to million from million in the decrease in operating income is due to the decline in revenue and an increase in road maintenance and silviculture costs 
export log market 
log revenue from our timberland ownership is significantly affected by export log market conditions 
sales to the export market totaled   and of log revenue for   and  respectively 
the vast majority of our export log volume is sold to japan 
indirect sales to the export market totaled mmbf  mmbf  and mmbf of softwood logs for   and  respectively 
the increase in volume sold through the export market in is representative of the strengthening export market experienced in combined with a harvest plan that included timber stands with a large component of export quality timber volume 
a falling us dollar and improved economic conditions in japan brought on an improvement in the export market for logs 
as export markets improve  volume that in a weaker market would be sold to the domestic market is diverted to the export market where log volume commands a higher price 
the decline in volume sold to the export market in relative to is indicative of the soft economic conditions in japan during the average price per mbf realized for export logs sold was   and for   and  respectively 
prices realized from export logs in increased from this improvement is indicative of the general improvement in export market conditions discussed above and an improvement in the quality of logs sold to the export market in the  acre timberland acquisition completed in january contained a large component of high quality logs that command a premium price on the export market 
export prices realized did not change from to low export prices realized in and were driven largely by weak economic conditions in japan and structural changes to the market for logs 
domestic log market 
domestic sawlog volumes were mmbf  mmbf  and mmbf in   and  respectively 
the increase in domestic volume sold in from is due to the overall increase in log volume harvested partially offset by the increase in volume sold to the export market 
average realized domestic log prices per mbf were   and in   and  respectively 
the prices realized from the domestic market in relative to is due to strong housing starts in the us combined with the improved export market driving prices higher for the domestic market 
prices realized from domestic log sales declined from to due to two separate factors 
first  lumber imports from canada had increased during as a result of the softwood lumber dispute between the us and canada 
as a result  log prices declined as domestic mills were competing with imported canadian lumber 
second  the domestic log market was saturated with logs that were redirected away from weak japanese export markets in other timber products 
pulpwood  hardwood  and other log volumes represented   and of total harvest volume for   and  respectively 
the increase in pulpwood  hardwood and other log volumes in relative to is due to harvesting more low quality stands from the hood canal tree farm in which resulted in a large component of pulp log volume 
the increase in other timber volume sold in relative to is due to the harvesting of lower quality hemlock stands on the hood canal tree farm 
logs sold as pulpwood generally command lower prices than logs sold as sawlogs in the domestic market 
to the extent log volume can be moved from pulpwood to domestic sawlog sorts  higher revenue is realized 
other log prices were   and per mbf for   and  respectively 
the increase in price realized on other timber products in as compared to results from the overall improvement in log prices forcing mills to raise prices to obtain log volume to keep mills operating 
the improvement in price realized on pulpwood in relative to was caused by a decline in local pulp log inventories 
harvest volumes and seasonality 
we harvested the following timber for each year in the three year period ended december  year softwood sawlogs pulp  hardwood  and other totals volume mmbf price mbf volume mmbf price mbf volume mmbf price mbf the partnership s  acres of timberland consist of the  acre hood canal tree farm and the  acre columbia tree farm 
the hood canal tree farm is located in the hood canal region of washington state 
most of this tree farm acreage is at a relatively low elevation where harvest activities are possible year round 
as a result of this competitive advantage  we are often able to harvest and sell a greater portion of our annual harvest in the first half of the year when the log supply in the marketplace tends to be lower 
during management decided to front load harvest toward the beginning of the year to take advantage of an improved export log market 
though not as dramatically as  harvest activities were also front loaded in as log prices had improved in the first quarter of over those experienced at the end of harvest activities in were relatively consistent from quarter to quarter 
harvest activities in may be concentrated during the months of winter and early spring 
the pacific northwest is experiencing an unusually dry winter  which is expected to result in very dry conditions during the summer months 
during dry conditions harvest activities are restricted or curtailed all together due to the risk of fire 
the percentage of annual harvest volume harvested by quarter for each year in the three year period ended december  is as follows year ended q q q q december  december  december  cost of sales fee timber cost of sales for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended depletion harvest  haul and other total cost of sales december  million million million december  million million million december  million million million depletion costs from harvest activities averaged   and  per mbf for   and respectively 
the depletion rate changes each year as harvested timber stands are removed  or depleted  and new depletion layers are added to the overall depletion pool as merchantable timber stands reach the age of years 
the depletion rate in increased from the rate in due to the addition of two new depletion pools for two timberland acquisitions made in the last half of the decrease in depletion rate from to reflects the interplay between removing harvested timber stands and adding new depletion layers 
depletion cost in will include expense recognized from one of the separate depletion pools 
these separate depletion pools were created when we purchased two separate timber tracts in that were almost entirely merchantable timber 
we expect to harvest approximately mmbf in and mmbf of this harvest is expected to come from one of these separate pools resulting in depletion cost of million 
the depletion cost on this harvest is expected to approximate the net stumpage otherwise realized on the sale of this particular timber  which will result in almost no net income impact from the harvest but will nonetheless generate operating cash flow 
when the depletion cost from this separate pool is blended with depletion costs attributable to all other harvesting  we expect the overall weighted average depletion rate in will be approximately mbf 
harvest  haul and other costs excluding costs resulting from timberland sales averaged   and per mbf for   and  respectively 
harvest costs vary based upon the physical site characteristics of acreage harvested 
harvest units that are difficult to access  or that are located on steep hillsides  are more expensive to harvest 
haul costs vary based upon the distance between the harvest site and the customer s location 
costs to harvest and haul timber have on average increased slightly in due to the increase in the cost of fuel 
this increase is not reflected in average harvest  haul and other costs in due to the mix of stands harvested in which were generally easier to access and harvest than those harvested in average harvest  haul and other costs increased modestly from to due to slightly more difficult to access timber stands harvested during costs resulting from timberland sales were zero   and  in   and  respectively 
we did not have any timberland sales in operating expenses fee timber operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
operating costs increased in relative to due to an increase in road maintenance and silviculture costs  partially resulting from the increase in harvest volume but also due to increased costs for road maintenance resulting from new road maintenance rules in washington state 
operating costs increased in relative to due to added silviculture and road maintenance costs 
washington state has enacted new water quality rules  which have resulted in changes to the rules surrounding road maintenance and construction 
as a result  culverts that do not comply with the new rules need to be replaced  which has resulted in an increase in road maintenance costs over the last couple years and is expected to continue into silviculture costs represent the cost of projects that are undertaken for the purpose of increasing the quantity or quality of our timber inventory 
examples include management of competing vegetation and work performed to improve the seed stock available for us to grow seedlings for future reforestation 
timberland management consulting revenue and operating income the timberland management consulting segment earns revenue by providing timberland management and forestry consulting services to timberland owners and managers 
an additional aspect of that segment s activities is the development of timberland property portfolios on behalf of third party clients 
management is currently marketing a timber fund to accredited investors interested in investing directly in timberland properties to diversify their portfolios 
the timberland management consulting segment has been in transition during following successful completion of our project to manage and dispose of  acres of industrial timberlands in december on january  we began managing  acres of timberland for cascade timberlands llc  which is expected to have a positive impact on earnings in revenue and operating income for the timberland management consulting segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended revenue operating income loss december  million million december  million million december  million million net of  of restructuring charges fiscal year compared to revenue decreased  or  to million in from million in operating income declined  to a loss of  in from income of  in the decrease in revenue and operating income was primarily a result of completing a timberland management and disposition project in december operations in were focused on signing up new timberland management clients 
we were successful in this endeavor and expect revenue and operating results for this segment to improve in as we began providing management services on  acres of timberland located in oregon and washington on january  fiscal year compared to revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a major client s decision to not renew its management contract with ormllc and the closure of our canadian forestry consulting offices at the end of operating income declined  or 
revenue in includes million from a major timberland management client 
ormllc successfully completed the management assignment for this client in december operating expenses timberland management consulting operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
notwithstanding that we entered without a major client for this segment  we determined to maintain our investment in people and operating infrastructure given prospects for new business 
accordingly  operating expenses remained basically flat between and operating expenses decreased million  or  in relative to as a result of reducing the offices and support infrastructure supporting the hancock timber resource group htrg contract and closure of the forestry consulting offices in canada 
investor portfolio management business ipmb ipmb operations include timberland management and portfolio development 
an example of portfolio development is orm timber fund i  lp 
if and when the fund is fully subscribed  both timberland management and asset management fees will be earned from administering the fund 
these activities are  as well as the development and marketing costs associated with the fund  part of the ipmb 
ipmb operations are currently conducted in ormllc and are subject to the following terms in the fund s limited partnership agreement 
limitation on expenditures the amendment to pope resources limited partnership agreement authorizing the ipmb strategy limits our cumulative net expenditures to  including debt guarantees 
as of december  cumulative expenditures incurred in pursuit of ipmb opportunities  including guarantees  were less than cumulative revenue generated 
therefore  cumulative net expenditures as of december  against the  limit are zero 
allocation of income the amendment to pope resources limited partnership agreement further specifies that income from the ipmb will be split using a sliding scale allocation method beginning at to the partnership s wholly owned subsidiary  orm  inc  and to pope mgp  inc  the managing general partner of the partnership 
the sliding scale allocation method will evenly divide ipmb income between orm  inc and pope mgp  inc 
once such income reaches  in any given fiscal year 
real estate revenue and operating income real estate segment revenue is derived from land sales and rental income from income producing properties 
results from real estate operations are expected to vary significantly from year to year as we make multi year investments in entitlements and infrastructure prior to selling entitled or developed land 
revenue and operating income for the real estate segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended revenue operating income loss december  million million december  million million december  million million includes  of environmental remediation charges related to port gamble includes  of environmental remediation charges related to port gamble and  of warranty charges related to port ludlow 
fiscal year compared to revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in operating income for this segment also improved from a loss of  in to operating income of million in the increase in revenue and operating income are due to an increase in land sales in relative to we had land sale revenue of million generating operating income of million in  which compares favorably with land sale revenue of  and operating income from land sales of  the majority of land sale revenue came from two transactions 
the first transaction was a million sale to kitsap county of acres that the county plans to develop into a park 
this sale has the added benefit of enhancing the value of the partnership s other development properties neighboring the planned park 
the second transaction was for million and closed in december this transaction represented acres that had a preliminary plat filed with the county thus increasing the value of the property to developers 
fiscal year compared to revenue increased  or  to million from million in the increase in revenue is due to an increase in revenue generated at the port gamble townsite offset by a decrease in revenue from land sales 
the port gamble townsite has benefited from increased management attention following the sale of port ludlow in management has identified several buildings that were not being utilized to their full potential and  after making some capital improvements  has leased the properties at higher rates than previously realized 
land sale revenue has declined following the sale of all the lots in the seabeck and grandridge plats 
cost of sales real estate cost of sales for each of the three years ended december    and were   and million  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales in is due to the increase in revenue generated from land sales 
the decrease in cost of sales in relative to is due to the decrease in cost of sales attributable to land following the sale of the last seabeck and grandridge lots in  which had a relatively high cost basis 
operating costs real estate operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in operating costs in relative to is due to the environmental remediation charge of  combined with a small increase in repairs and maintenance costs at the port gamble townsite 
the decrease in operating expense from to is due to  of environmental remediation and  of warranty charges in partially offset by an increase in operating expenses for the gig harbor property in environmental remediation costs we have an accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation charges in and around the townsite of port gamble of  and  at december  and  respectively 
port gamble is a historic town that was owned by pope talbot  inc p t for decades until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t continued to operate the townsite through and lease the millsite at port gamble until january when a settlement agreement was signed between the partnership and p t  which divided up the responsibility for paying environmental remediation charges in port gamble 
the millsite is referred to as such because it was the location for many years of an operating lumber mill through that was dismantled by the end of activity in the environmental remediation liability consists of the following balances at the beginning of the period additions to accrual environmental remediation expenditures balances at the end of the period year ended december     year ended december     year ended december      as of december  the majority of the clean up work was complete 
most of the expenditures now represent the cost of groundwater monitoring those specific sites where contaminants were excavated and removed 
this monitoring is required until the site receives four clean test results over four consecutive quarterly periods 
the remaining liability as of december  is expected to be adequate to cover remaining costs 
if monitoring activities discover additional contamination  however  costs could exceed management s current estimate 
general and administrative g a fiscal year compared to g a costs increased  or  to million from million in the modest increase in g a costs is due to an increase in the accrual for supplemental employee retirement plan serp liabilities of  combined with an increase in compensation cost 
the beneficiary of the serp is a retired ceo 
g a costs represented of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to of revenue for the comparable period in we expect g a in to increase as a result of the costs of implementing section of the sarbanes oxley act 
section requires management to assess the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december  our auditors  will then audit management s assessment and express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the partnership s internal controls over financial reporting 
management s assessment and the auditor reports will be included in the partnership s k for the year ended december  the cost of this new requirement is currently estimated to result in additional g a costs of approximately  in fiscal year compared to g a costs decreased million  or  to million from million in the decrease is due to reductions in administrative headcount following the loss of the htrg contract in december of g a costs represented of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to of revenue for the comparable period in taxes fiscal year compared to income tax expense represents the tax expense associated with the partnership s taxable subsidiaries where third party fee for service business is conducted

the partnership invested million in three separate timberland acquisitions during the first transaction was for  acres of timberland acquired from plum creek timber company  inc in january this property is being managed as part of the columbia tree farm inasmuch as these acquired acres are intermingled with that larger holding 
the second and third acquisitions totaling  acres closed during the fourth quarter of and were both opportunities to acquire in holdings on the partnership s existing hood canal tree farm and were forested with ready to harvest  merchantable timber 
these fourth quarter acquisitions were funded by a combination of cash reserves and a line of credit 
as of december  the balance on this credit facility was  the january acquisition had an impact on harvest levels and will have a similar impact on harvest levels and cash flows 
one of the two fourth quarter acquisitions was a very small parcel and the mature timber thereon has been harvested so as to essentially pay for its acquisition 
harvests of mature timber on the other fourth quarter acquisition should produce significant cash flows in such that we expect its acquisition price also to be largely recovered in the near term 
we generate operating cash flow through the sale of timber products  by providing timberland management and consulting services  and by selling land for development 
significant recurring uses of cash include the following replanting and fertilizing trees  maintaining an adequate road system on our tree farms  investing in our development properties  funding annual debt payments on timber mortgages and local improvement district debt  and funding quarterly cash distributions 
as a general rule  management expects operating cash flows will be sufficient to cover the foregoing and to build up cash reserves 
as discussed below  however  we may incur additional debt in the future to fund timberland purchases or significant capital improvements on our development properties if management determines operating cash flows or cash reserves are not sufficient to cover these expenditures 
in the fourth quarter of management entered into an agreement with bank of america  n 
a for a one year million line of credit 
operating cash flows 
the table below provides the components of operating cash flows for each of the three years   and cash received from customers and paid to suppliers and employees results from the harvest and sale of forest products from our tree farms  timberland management and consulting services provided to timberland owners  and finally  the sale and management of our development properties 
operating cash flow cash received from customers    cash paid to suppliers and employees   interest received    interest paid    income taxes paid    total    in cash provided by operations increased million to million from million in the majority of this increase was produced by the fee timber segment due to an increase in timber volume harvested from mmbf in to mmbf in combined with a per mbf  or  increase in realized prices on log volume sold in the real estate segment also contributed to improved operating cash flow with an increase in cash provided by land sales of million 
cash flow from operating activities is expected to increase in as we increase our annual harvest to mmbf from s level of mmbf 
in cash provided by operations decreased  or  to million from million in the decrease in cash provided by operations is due primarily to the loss of the htrg timberland management contract in december in addition to the loss of cash generated from this contract we made restructuring payments of  during to adjust our operating infrastructure following the loss of this portion of our operations 
offsetting these decreases in operating cash flow was a million decrease in cash paid for the environmental remediation at port gamble and an increase in cash generated by the fee timber segment as a result of the timing of harvest activities at the end of and during cash used in investing activities 
the table below represents the components of cash used in investing activities for the three years   and recurring investing activities consist primarily of tree planting  road building and silviculture activities on our tree farms and investment in our development properties to acquire the entitlements necessary to make further development of the properties possible 
in we invested million in three separate transactions to acquire  acres of timberland 
investing activities timberland acquisitions  land buildings and equipment    development properties    timber and roads    proceeds from the sale of fixed assets   cash used in investing activities   cash used in investing activities increased million from the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of  acres of timberland in the timberlands acquired in these transactions were forested with a large component of merchantable timber that enabled the partnership to increase its annual harvest in to mmbf from mmbf in these timberland acquisitions and related increased harvest activities also resulted in an increase in investments in timber and roads higher replanting and road building expenditures 
investments in development properties increased in to million from  in this increase correlates to our heightened intensity of activity on our acre property at gig harbor  washington given the expectation of land sales at this parcel beginning in the million in development property additions includes  for a land acquisition bordering the gig harbor site and  for a parcel at the port gamble townsite 
these acquisitions represent strategic opportunities to acquire acres bordering on our existing properties that management expect will add value to the partnership s holdings 
cash used in investing activities increased  or  in to million from due to an increase in investments in development properties  a decrease in proceeds from the sale of fixed assets netted against a decrease in permanent road construction temporary roads and road repair are expensed as incurred 
the increase in development property capital expenditures has been driven by an increase in activities on our development property at gig harbor 
in  we sold an office building acquired with the columbia tree farm that resulted in proceeds from sales of fixed assets of nearly million 
cash used in financing activities 
the table below represents the components of cash used in financing activities for the three years   and our financing activities primarily result from payments made on the timber mortgages  unitholder distributions  and distributions to the managing general partner  pope mgp  for its minority interest in the ipmb 
financing activities mortgage lid payments    cash distribution to unitholders    net draw on line of credit  proceeds from option excercises  minority interest distribution    cash used in financing activities   cash used in financing activities increased  in this increase is due to an unscheduled pay down of our timber mortgage of  an increase in cash payments on local improvement district lid debt  and an increase in our quarterly distributions 
the unscheduled mortgage payment was made following the sale of acres to kitsap county 
these acres were included as collateral under the timber mortgage and the partial deed release required some incremental debt repayment 
in addition  the partnership began making payments on a  lid in that represents the partnership s share of the cost of a new road at the gig harbor property that has had a positive impact on the value of that property 
in the third quarter of we increased our quarterly distribution rate from 
to 
per unit as a result of the increase in cash generated from operations in cash used in financing activities increased million  or  to million in compared to half this increase is due to an increase in required principal payments on our timber mortgages from million in to million in the increase in required annual principal payments under the mortgages was negotiated and scheduled at the time of the acquisition of the columbia tree farm in the other half of the increase is due to higher quarterly cash distributions to unitholders 
in we made two quarterly distributions totaling per unit and in we made four quarterly distributions totaling per unit 
expected future changes to cash flows operating cash flows 
as discussed above  we plan to increase the partnership s annual harvest volume from mmbf in to mmbf in as previously discussed  this increase is due to two of the timberland acquisitions in the increased harvest level will translate to higher cash flow from operations in assuming we do not acquire any additional timberland in  the annual harvest in is expected to return to our sustainable harvest level of mmbf 
investing activities 
investing activities in include a planned million co investment in orm timber fund i  lp the fund 
the fund is currently being marketed to institutional investors and high net worth individuals as a vehicle for investment in timberlands with a raised capital target of million 
the partnership has agreed to co invest of the total amount of equity capital raised by the fund 
this investment will not be made until the fund is fully subscribed and timberland acquisitions have been identified 
in addition to the fund  expenditures on our project at gig harbor are expected to total million in and capital expenditures on our bremerton property are expected to total million in gig harbor capital expenditures in are expected to include a new water tank and a new access road on the property 
capital expenditures on the bremerton property are expected to include a storm water retention facility and road and sewer extension 
financing activities 
when the fund is fully subscribed we may need to raise additional capital to make our co investment in the fund 
additionally  management is always looking for opportunities to add to our timberland portfolio where expected returns meet management s expectations 
the capital infusion required for gig harbor is expected to be only short term to bridge the time between making infrastructure investments and closing land sales such as our acre sale to costco wholesale corporation 
management anticipates using short term bank debt to bridge this capital need 
we currently have a one year  million line of credit facility in place that we will renew if necessary 
our debt to total capitalization ratio as of december   as measured by the book and market value of our equity  was and  respectively 
should a financing need arise  management is comfortable that there is room to take on some debt with the ratio at these levels  since our loan covenant which limits debt to total capitalization to is measured against the lower of these two calculations 
the hood canal tree farm secures the partnership s current timberland mortgage while the columbia tree farm is not currently used as collateral on any debt obligations 
the partnership s strong financial position and historically low interest rates makes borrowing relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain 
risks and uncertainties a number of known risks  some of which are discussed below  as well as various unknown risks and uncertainties  may cause our revenues to fall short of management s expectations 
although certain statements in this report are forward looking in nature  these known and unknown risks make it impossible for management to predict with any degree of certainty either quantitative factors such as cash flow  results of operations or financial condition  or qualitative factors such as management s plans  objectives  or responses to various events or occurrences 
readers therefore should recognize that statements other than those of historical fact are not guarantees or assurances of future performance  but are forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law 
some of our forward looking statements can be identified by the use of predictive terms such as expect  anticipate  will  might  may  plans and words of similar meaning or construction 
the following section discusses some of the known risks that may cause our actual financial results to fall materially short of management s expectations  or that may cause management to deviate from its expressed intentions or predictions 
readers should also recognize that this list is not exhaustive  and in addition to those factors listed below  a wide range of risks faced by most or all participants in the timber industry or in international trade  as well as various unexpected events or conditions  may adversely impact our business 
competition generally 
we compete against much larger companies in each of our business segments 
we compete with these companies for management and line personnel  as well as for purchases of relatively scarce capital assets such as land and standing timber and for sales of our products 
these larger competitors may have access to larger amounts of capital and significantly greater economies of scale  and they may be better able to absorb the risks of our line of business 
moreover  the timber industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years  and as that consolidation occurs  our relative market share decreases and the relative financial capacity of our competitors increases 
while management believes the partnership is at a competitive advantage over some of these companies because of our lack of vertical integration into forest products manufacturing  our advantageous tax structure  and management s attempts to diversify our asset base  we cannot assure readers that competition will not have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial condition 
fee timber competition and demand issues 
fee timber revenue is generated primarily through the sale of softwood logs to the domestic markets and export intermediaries located in western washington 
the market for these products is significantly affected by fluctuations in us and japanese economies and in relative currency exchange rates 
the market for our timber products is generally negatively affected by the rise in the use of engineered wood products that substitute for solid sawn products 
the rise in the use of engineered wood products results in less of a premium for larger diameter douglas fir logs 
many of the engineered wood products are made from lower quality logs  which over time has eroded log prices and created more of a commoditization of wood fiber 
while timber sold has realized lower prices with the rise in engineered wood products  wood fiber is expected to remain an important commodity that management expects will continue to be used extensively for building 
the proximity of lumber mills to the timberland supplying these mills is important to our profitability 
in prior years western washington experienced a trend towards consolidation of lumber mills to fewer  larger volume manufacturers 
local demand for our products has remained strong through the trend towards consolidation of lumber mills in western washington 
this trend has eased in with the actual and announced opening of several mills in the puget sound area of washington state 
if in the future consolidation leads to less local competition for wood fiber  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
canadian lumber imports declined in as british columbia s timber harvest volume declined due to hot dry weather and other production interruptions 
prior to  canadian lumber imports had increased for a few years 
lumber supply from canada can cause a weakening in log prices in the us  when volume from canada results in lower lumber prices for domestic mills which in turn can have a negative affect on log price and demand 
our ability to grow and harvest timber can be significantly impacted by legislation to restrict or stop forest practices 
restrictions to logging  planting  road building  fertilizing  managing competing vegetation  and other activities can significantly increase the cost or reduce available inventory thereby reducing future income 
timberland management consulting 
one or two clients have traditionally dominated revenue in the timberland management consulting segment 
in december this segment completed a timberland management and disposition project  which left the timberland management consulting segment without a major client for the first time since in january we began a new timberland management assignment for  acres 
that assignment is expected to represent the majority of revenue for the timberland management consulting segment in in over of timberland management consulting was generated through work for one client 
this work was performed as part of a project related to the long term management agreement that began in january real estate 
the value of our real estate investments is subject to changes in the economic and regulatory environment 
our real estate investments are long term in nature  which raises the risk of unforeseen changes in the economy or laws surrounding development activities having an adverse affect on our investments 
tax status 
the partnership is a master limited partnership mlp and is therefore not subject to income taxes 
if that changed due to a change in tax law or interpretation of current tax law such that the partnership became subject to income taxes  operating results would be adversely affected 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and contingencies our commitments at december  consist of performance bonds  operating leases  and purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
payments due by period commitment expiration period obligation or commitment total less than year years years after years total debt      million line of credit   performance bonds   operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations none other long term obligations      total contractual obligations    we have debt totaling million with the contractual maturities described in note of partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report plus a  balance on a revolving line of credit 
cash paid for interest on the revolving line of credit was  in the million revolving line of credit expires on october  the partnership has committed to invest of equity capital in orm timber fund i  lp once a timberland acquisition is closed by the fund 
targeted equity capital for this fund is million and at that level the partnership s commitment would be million 
the partnership will make this investment once the fund is fully subscribed and timberland acquisitions have been identified 
other long term obligations include the partnership s  contingent liability for environmental remediation in and around the port gamble townsite and  liability for a supplemental employment retirement plan 
we expect to spend  of these liabilities in and  thereafter 
the partnership may from time to time be a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that loss to the partnership  if any  will not have a material adverse effect to the partnership s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the partnership is not a party to off balance sheet arrangements and does not hold any variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
capital expenditures and commitments projected capital expenditures in of million are currently expected to include million for the gig harbor site and million for the bremerton site 
the partnership also expects to make half of its planned investment in the timber fund of million in these expenditures could be increased or decreased as a consequence of future economic conditions 
projected capital expenditures at the gig harbor and bremerton site are subject to permitting timetables and progress towards closing on specific land sale transactions  especially those with costco wholesale corp 
and kitsap county consolidated housing authority 
government regulation compliance with laws  regulations  and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as operating costs 
we cannot easily quantify future amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with laws  regulations  and demands  or the effects on operating costs  because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive 
accordingly  at this time we have not included herein a quantification of future capital requirements to comply with any new regulations being developed by the united states or canadian regulatory agencies 
additionally  many federal and state environmental regulations  as well as local zoning and land use ordinances  place limits upon various aspects of our operations 
these limits include restrictions on our harvest methods and volumes  remediation requirements that may increase our post harvest reclamation costs  esa limitations on our ability to harvest in certain areas  zoning and development restrictions that impact our real estate segment  and a wide range of other existing and pending statutes and regulations 
various initiatives are presented from time to time that seek further restrictions on timber and real estate development businesses  and although management currently is not aware of any material noncompliance with applicable law  we cannot assure readers that we ultimately will be successful in complying with all such regulations or that additional regulations will not ultimately have a material adverse impact upon our business 
accounting matters accounting standards not yet implemented in december  the fasb released its revised standard  sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the vesting period 
a public entity will initially measure the cost of liability based service awards based on its current fair value and the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
adoption of sfas r is required for fiscal periods beginning after june  the company is evaluating sfas r and believes it will likely result in recognition of additional non cash stock based compensation expense and accordingly would decrease net income in amounts  which likely will be considered material 
there will be no effect on cash  working capital or total stockholders equity 
the partnership is currently negotiating with several potential investors in orm timber find i  lp the fund 
the fund has a target invested capital amount of million 
upon funding this million target  the fund will seek to invest the raised capital in timberland investments 
the partnership will invest of the equity capital in the fund so that  for example  if the target of million is reached pope resources will have contributed million of that equity total 
the fund is presently expected to be consolidated into the partnership s financial statements since an indirect subsidiary of the partnership olympic resource management llc will act as manager and general partner of the fund 
however  emerging issues task force issue no 
 investors accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investors is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights when finally concluded and issued  could require that the partnership not consolidate  but rather account for the fund using the equity method of accounting 
use of either the consolidation or equity method of accounting are expected to result in comparable net income and partners capital in the consolidated financial statements of the partnership 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to management s calculation of timber depletion and liabilities related to matters such as environmental remediation  potential asset impairments  and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
in relation to liabilities  potential impairments and other estimated charges  it is management s policy to conduct ongoing reviews of significant accounting policies and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial results of the partnership 
the assumptions used are tested against available and relevant information and reviewed with subject matter experts for consistency and reliability 
during the preparation of financial results  when facts or circumstances indicate that asset impairment may exist  tests are conducted to ascertain that the net book carrying values of these assets are not in excess of fair values 
these tests use current market information  if available  or other generally accepted valuation methods  such as future cash flows 
when the use of estimates is necessary  an exact answer is unlikely  and therefore  the reporting within a range of likely outcomes is used in the preparation of the financial statements 
tests are also applied in order to be reasonably assured that liabilities are properly reflected on the records of the partnership and that the notes to the financial statements are prepared in a fashion that informs readers of possible outcomes and risks associated with the conduct of business 
depletion 
depletion represents the cost of timber harvested and is charged to operations by applying a depletion rate to volume harvested during the period 
the depletion rate is calculated on january st of each year by dividing the partnership s cost of merchantable timber by the volume of merchantable timber 
merchantable timber is defined as timber that is equal to or greater than years of age 
to calculate the depletion rate the partnership uses a combined pool when the characteristics of the acquired timber are not significantly different from the partnership s existing timberlands 
prior to the fourth quarter of  all of the partnership s timberlands were aggregated into one depletion cost pool 
the partnership acquired approximately  acres of timberland in the last quarter of that was accounted for in separate depletion pools 
these acquisitions were almost entirely merchantable timber  which made the inventory characteristics of these acquisitions sufficiently different from our existing timber pool to indicate separate depletion pools were warranted under our accounting policy 
depletion cost in will include expense recognized from one of the separate depletion pools 
we expect to harvest approximately mmbf from this pool in resulting in depletion cost of million 
the depletion cost on this harvest is expected to approximate the net stumpage realized on the sale  which will result in almost no net income impact from the harvest but will generate operating cash flow 
as a result of this additional depletion in we expect the overall weighted average depletion rate in will be approximately mbf 
inventory volumes take into account the applicable state and federal regulatory limits on timber harvests as applied to the partnership s properties  including the new forests and fish law that supplements washington state s forest practice regulations to provide for expanded riparian management zones  wildlife leave trees  and other harvest restrictions 
timber inventory volume is accounted for by the partnership s standing timber inventory system  which utilizes annual statistical sampling of the timber cruising together with adjustments made for estimated annual growth and the depletion of areas harvested 
the standing inventory system is subject to two processes each year to monitor accuracy 
the first is the annual cruise process and the second is a comparison of a volume actually extracted by harvest to b inventory in the standing inventory system at the time of the harvest 
a cruise represents a physical measurement of timber on a specific set of acres 
the cruise process is completed when the physical measurement totals are compared to the volume captured in the standing inventory system 
only productive acres with timber that is at least years old are selected as subject to a cruise 
the partnership cruised of its productive acres with year old or greater timber in   and and plans to continue to cruise of productive acres in before reducing this level to in subsequent years 
specific acres are first selected for cruising with a bias towards those acres that have gone the longest without a cruise and  second  with a bias towards those acres that have been growing the longest 
as the cruise is being performed  only those trees with a breast height diameter approximately feet from the ground of at least inches are measured for inclusion in the inventory 
a change in estimated timber inventory volume would have changed depletion expense by  environmental remediation 
the environmental remediation liability represents an estimate of payments required to remedy and monitor certain areas in and around the townsite and millsite of port gamble 
port gamble is a historic town that was owned and operated by p t  a related party  until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t continued to operate the millsite until and leased the millsite and townsite at port gamble through january  at which point p t signed an agreement with the partnership dividing the responsibility for environmental remediation of port gamble between the two parties 
the environmental remediation liability on the partnership s books is based upon an estimate of the partnership s portion of the clean up costs under this agreement with p t 
based on information provided by consultants the partnership estimated that the range of costs remaining to complete this project at december  is between  and  during the environmental liability increased  as a result of costs to complete the partnership s share exceeding the original estimate and decreased  for actual expenditures 
while the majority of the partnership s portion of the clean up efforts is complete  there remains the possibility that the remaining remediation or monitoring activities may exceed estimates  resulting in an additional environmental remediation charge 
management will continue to monitor the remaining liability against estimates to complete to determine if an adjustment to the environmental remediation liability is necessary to accurately represent management s estimate of remaining cost to complete the project 
land held for development 
land held for development represents the partnership s cost basis in land that has been identified as having greater value as development than timber property 
our real estate department works with these properties to establish entitlements with city and county officials that allow for further development 
these entitlement costs are evaluated for capitalization based upon the expected value derived from the efforts 
for example  costs incurred to change urban growth area boundaries are expensed as incurred due to the difficulty of successfully changing these boundaries but the cost of applying for a preliminary plat is generally capitalized as these efforts have a high likelihood of success and thus increase the value of the property 
those properties that are either under contract or where the partnership is planning to sell within the next months are classified as a current asset under land held for sale 
deferred tax assets 
the partnership has a united states subsidiary corporation that has  of deferred tax assets as of december  the majority of this balance relates to net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the liquidation of our subsidiary in canada 
management evaluates the likelihood of earning taxable income to absorb net operating loss carryforwards each reporting period to determine if deferred tax assets are likely to be utilized 
the partnership has concluded that deferred tax assets as december  are more likely than not to be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the partnership had million with a fixed interest rate of  million with a fixed interest rate of  and local improvement district debt of million with fixed interest rates of to 
this fixed rate debt totals million outstanding with a fair value of approximately million based on current interest rates for similar financial instruments 
a change in the interest rate on fixed rate debt will affect the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rate on variable rate debt will affect interest expense and cash flows 
a hypothetical change in prevailing interest rates would change the fair value of the partnership s fixed rate long term debt obligations by million since the partnership s currently outstanding debt is fixed rate  net income and cash flows are not affected when market interest rates change 
the partnership also has a million line of credit with a balance of  as of december  interest on this obligation is variable using either the bank s prime rate or libor plus percentage points
