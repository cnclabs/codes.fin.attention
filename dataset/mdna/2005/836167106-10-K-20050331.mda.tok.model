item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations internal investigation during october  the company  with the oversight and approval of the audit committee of our board of directors  initiated an investigation of the financial results of one of our operating subsidiaries in the information management and distribution reportable segment the operating subsidiary 
the findings of the investigation concluded that the operating subsidiary had incorrectly recognized revenue for certain customer arrangements and omitted certain operating expenses from its financial results which in turn resulted in overpayments and over accruals of contingent consideration amounts due under the earn out provisions of the acquisition agreement for the operating subsidiary which had been originally recognized as additional goodwill of the acquired business 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and have been restated from the amounts previously reported  as discussed below 
as described in our critical accounting policies  revenue is recognizable when each of the following conditions is met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and collection is reasonably assured 
we have identified certain instances where one or more of the aforementioned revenue recognition conditions as applied to certain customer contracts were not met by the operating subsidiary 
as a result  the revenue previously recognized that did not meet all the mentioned revenue recognition conditions has been reversed  resulting in a downward adjustment to certain asset accounts or the recognition of a customer liability or deferred revenue  if the customer has paid the invoices related to the reversed revenue 
notwithstanding the reversal of revenue  the direct costs associated with the reversed revenue continue to be reported in the period incurred 
in addition  we have evaluated the direct costs related to deferred revenue and have determined to continue to include the direct costs in the period incurred due to the uncertainty regarding the future recoverability of the associated costs 
the following table identifies the revenue adjustments by issue that are reflected in the restated financial statements year ended dec 
 year ended dec 
 year ended dec 
 in thousands asset accounts customer liability  net deferred revenue  net total net revenue adjustment asset accounts represents the reversal of previously recognized revenue through the downward adjustment of certain asset accounts where one or more of the aforementioned revenue recognition conditions as applied to certain customer contracts were not met by the operating subsidiary 
to the extent that the write down relates to performed services that exceeded the contractual funding limitation  a portion of the revenue may be recognized in future periods upon customer authorization 
customer liability  net the operating subsidiary in certain instances recognized revenue for services that were never performed 
the customers were invoiced for the non performed services and collection of the invoices has occurred 
a portion of the customer liability may be recognized as revenue in future periods upon successful completion of services or negotiations with the operating subsidiary s customer s 
remaining customer liability balances will be extinguished through either customer refund or applying such remaining customer liability against future provided services 
deferred revenue  net the operating subsidiary recognized revenue for performed services although the related contractually required services designed to meet customer specific acceptance provisions ie quality standards were not performed 
the customers were invoiced for the performed services and collection of the invoices has occurred 
however  by not complying with the contract  the operating subsidiary is unable to reasonably demonstrate that the performed services met the required quality standard s 
this has resulted in the deferral of revenue for performed services for which acceptance is contingent upon meeting the required quality standard s 
the operating subsidiary will recognize the revenue for performed services upon obtaining explicit acceptance from the customer s 
in the event customer acceptance is not obtained  the deferred revenue will be reclassified to a customer liability 
the customer liability will be extinguished through either customer refund or applying such remaining customer liability against future provided services 
the investigation identified certain expenses of the operating subsidiary that were not properly recorded in the operating subsidiary s consolidated statement of operations 
certain former members of the operating subsidiary s management allegedly diverted expenses to entities they controlled  but that are unrelated to the company  resulting in the omission of the related expenses from the operating subsidiary s financial results and  as a result  our previously reported financial results 
we have identified the unrecorded expenses and have recorded them in the period the expenses were incurred as an adjustment to selling  general and administrative expense 
a liability for such an amount has been recorded to other long term obligations in the restated financial statements 
the liability will be eliminated at such time as we recover any contingent consideration overpayments paid to the former owners of the operating subsidiary or at such time management determines the liability has been extinguished  as discussed below 
the revenue recognition and expense omission issues affected previously paid contingent consideration related to the acquisition of the operating subsidiary 
as a result of the structure of the acquisition agreement  the former owners of the operating subsidiary had the opportunity to earn additional purchase consideration for the twelve month periods ended february   february  and february  the earn out period s based on earnings before interest and taxes of the operating subsidiary  in excess of designated thresholds  calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for each respective period the earn out agreement 
based on the findings of the investigation  earnings before interest and taxes attributable to the operating subsidiary were overstated during the earn out period s resulting in overpayments and overaccruals under the provisions of the earn out agreement that otherwise would not have been made 
we have expensed the contingent consideration overpayments in the financial statements in the periods in which they were paid  resulting in expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts had previously been accrued as contingent consideration and an addition to goodwill 
we have reversed these accruals and related goodwill in the periods originally recorded 
we will record a gain in future periods to the extent such contingent consideration overpayments are recovered 
restating the financial statements for the revenue recognition  expense omission and contingent consideration overpayment issues results in an adjustment to the provision for income taxes and to certain other balance sheet tax accounts for the periods restated

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements is contained under item business risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion gives effect to the restatement adjustments discussed above

we acquired the seven founding companies the founding companies simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering the ipo on january   and effectively began operations at that time 
the consideration for the founding companies consisted of a combination of cash and common stock of our company 
since the ipo  we have acquired companies and divested operating units by sales or closures 
we evaluate candidates for acquisition and periodically for divestiture as a part of our strategic plan of providing customers a single solution for business process outsourcing and knowledge based processing and consulting services 
the criteria for evaluation include geographic need  additional technology  market growth potential  industry expertise  service expansion to broaden service offerings  expansion of our customer base  revenue and earnings growth potential  and expected sources and uses of capital 
on may   we announced the acquisition of keypoint consulting  llc keypoint 
keypoint is an economic consulting firm with approximately principals and staff  and a network of academic affiliates 
keypoint provides economic  financial  and forensic accounting services in matters involving complex litigation and regulation 
keypoint s clients include companies  law firms  and government and regulatory agencies 
the acquisition of keypoint significantly expands our expertise in new practice areas and helps us strategically position for additional growth in our legal consulting area 
keypoint joined our legal consulting service offering and is reported in the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment 
key point contributed million in revenue in  or approximately of total segment revenue  and was moderately accretive to earnings after consideration of related financing costs and amortization of identified intangibles 
during the first quarter of  we completed a strategic evaluation of our operations based on certain criteria  such as strategic and financial fit  and future growth prospects 
as a result  on may   we formally committed to a plan of divestiture for certain non strategic asset groups 
the asset groups to be divested include the direct mail operations  previously reported in our information management and distribution segment  and two medical records management operations that were reported in our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment 
collectively  these asset groups incurred losses  net of tax  of million for the full year ended december  during the quarter ended june   we completed the sale of one of the medical records management operations 
the divestiture of the other medical records management operation and the direct mail operations were completed during the quarter ended september  see note  discontinued operations  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  for a more detailed discussion 
during the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement with one of our customers impacted by the facts relating to the subject of our internal investigation  more fully described above in internal investigation and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the agreement  we expect to recognize  during the first quarter of  revenue of million related to deferred revenue and customer liability restatement adjustments  however  such revenue will not contribute to the company s operating cash flow 
during the first quarter of we expect to incur additional legal and related expenses of approximately million as part of the finalization of our internal investigation 
business segments we aggregate our service offerings and operations into two reportable segments i information management and distribution  and ii healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance 
service offerings are aggregated when they are similar in the following areas economic characteristics  products and services  production processes  methods for distributing or delivering products  and type or class of customers 
we evaluate segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes 
all centrally incurred corporate costs are allocated to the segments based principally on operating income of the segments measured before the inclusion of the expense related to contingent consideration overpayments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the reporting segments follow the same accounting policies used for our consolidated financial statements as described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
at january   we transferred four operating units from the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment to the information management and distribution segment and one operating unit from the information management and distribution segment to the healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment 
these transfers were completed to better align these operating units results with operating units of similar core competencies 
during the year ended december   the company realigned certain operations in order to leverage management expertise  reduce costs  maximize profitability  and better align these operations with other operating units of similar core competencies 
the realignment resulted in certain operations being transferred from the information management and distribution reportable segment to the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance reportable segment 
the company has reclassified prior period amounts to be consistent with the current segment reporting 
the identified segments are as follows information management and distribution

as discussed in note  restatement  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  revenue recognition and expense omission issues at an operating subsidiary affected previously paid contingent consideration payments related to the acquisition of the operating subsidiary 
as a result  earnings before interest and taxes attributable to the operating subsidiary were overstated during the earn out period s resulting in payments made under the provisions of the earn out agreements that otherwise would not have been made 
the earn out overpayments have been expensed in the periods paid 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  s of revenue s of revenue revenue gross profit sg a operating income income from continuing operations before tax income from continuing operations revenue our revenue possesses both project and recurring characteristics 
project revenue includes one time projects in which the customer relationship is not expected to continue after project completion 
project revenue margins are usually higher than our average margins and the workload can be highly volatile 
project revenue is typically based on time and material arrangements and predominately occurs within our healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment 
recurring revenue is characterized by customer relationships that are generally for one year and may continue for longer 
recurring revenue is typically based on transaction volumes sent to us by our customers at an agreed upon fixed rate per unit 
our customers volumes are generally not contractually or otherwise guaranteed 
recurring revenue typically possesses lower margins than project revenue but is usually more predictable 
project revenue accounted for million or of revenue in the current year compared to million or of revenue in the prior year 
our operations generated revenues of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the prior year 
during the second quarter of  we acquired keypoint consulting  llc keypoint as a part of our healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment 
keypoint contributed approximately million to the revenue increase 
revenue within our information management and distribution segment increased from million in the prior year to million in the current year 
project revenue accounted for of segment revenue in the current year compared to last year 
the increase in segment revenue was primarily the result of higher volumes from existing customers and volumes from new customer contracts in our information management service offering 
also contributing to the increase in segment revenue were higher volumes in our statement processing service offering which increased  or million  during the current year 
revenue within our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment declined from million in to million in the acquisition of keypoint contributed approximately million of revenue in the current year 
the decline was primarily the result of lower volumes in our legal consulting service offering and in our medical coding and records release of information service offerings 
volumes in our legal consulting service offering were lower due to three significant projects in production during the increased market competition was a primary driver for the decline in medical coding and release of information 
partially offsetting the declines discussed above was higher project volumes in our class action claims administration service offering  which increased approximately  or million 
gross profit gross profit decreased from million  or of revenue  in to million  or of revenue  in the current year 
factors impacting gross profit and gross margin are discussed below 
contributing to the decline in gross profit were higher facilities related expenses of approximately million related to the opening of new production facilities  mainly to support growth initiatives within our information management and distribution segment  and higher bad debt expense of approximately million as the prior year reflected unusually large collections of accounts receivable balances outstanding greater than ninety days 
as discussed above in internal investigation  certain revenue generated at an operating subsidiary in our information management and distribution segment has been reversed  resulting in a downward adjustment to certain asset accounts or the recognition of a customer liability or deferred revenue  if the customer has paid the invoices related to the reversed revenue notwithstanding the reversal of revenue  the costs associated with the adjusted revenue continues to be reported in the period incurred 
as a result of the reversed revenue  gross margin was negatively impacted in and in partially offsetting the declines in gross margin discussed above were lower personnel related costs  as a percentage of revenue 
personnel related costs decreased from in the prior year to in the current year due primarily to our productivity and technology initiatives  such as high speed scanners  offshore production and pay for performance compensation plans  and expense of million incurred in the prior year related to an unusually large medical claim 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased from million  or of revenue  in to million  or of revenue in the current year 
the increase in sg a expense is largely attributable to i the costs associated with the settlement of a significant legal matter in the information management and distribution segment during the first quarter of of approximately million  ii legal and accounting costs of million associated with the investigation of the financial results of one of our operating subsidiaries  iii an increase in deferred compensation expense related to restricted stock of approximately million and other personnel related expense of approximately million  iv higher travel and marketing costs of approximately million  v higher hardware and software maintenance costs of approximately million  and vi higher professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance activity of approximately million 
income from continuing operations before income taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from million in to million in the current year 
the decrease was largely the result of the factors impacting gross margin and sg a discussed above 
in addition  as discussed above  revenue recognition and expense omission issues at an operating subsidiary affected previously paid contingent consideration payments related to the acquisition of the operating subsidiary 
as a result  payments made under the provisions of the earn out agreements that otherwise would not have been made have been expensed in the periods paid resulting in expense of million and million in and  respectively 
finally  the current year includes a net loss of million on the disposition of property  plant and equipment compared to a gain of million in the prior year 
interest expense was lower by approximately million in the current year due the expiration of the interest rate swap on march  and a more favorable interest rate environment during the current year 
interest income in the prior year included a one time payment of million related to a million income tax receivable that was also collected during provision benefit for from income taxes we reported provision for income taxes in the amount of million during this amount included a benefit of million related to favorable resolution of certain open tax issues as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain strategic tax positions and an additional benefit of approximately million related to increased state tax credits 
collectively  the benefit from income taxes had the affect of lowering our effective tax rate to during from during year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  s of revenue s of revenue revenue gross profit sg a operating income income from continuing operations before tax income from continuing operations revenue total revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  slightly lower project revenue was the primary reason for the revenue decline 
revenue within our information management and distribution segment declined million to million 
strong revenue growth from our mortgage industry customers for data capture and repository services produced volume gains of million as we added several new mortgage applications for current and new customers 
we also experienced strong revenue growth of million  or  from our statement processing service offering 
partially offsetting these revenue gains were the following i the loss of our service contract with the city of new york s human resource administration  ii non repeating project work representing a decline of million  iii lower volumes from transportation customers representing a decline of million  and iv lower revenue from credit card customers representing a decline of million 
during the third quarter of  the city of new york s human resource administration informed us that we did not receive their renewal contract award 
the contract was transitioned to the new vendor during the second quarter of resulting in million of lower revenue for within our information management service offering 
however  the loss of this contract did not result in a goodwill impairment as the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying value 
project revenue accounted for of the information management and distribution segment s revenue in compared to in revenue within our healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  project revenue within our class action claims administration and professional economic research and litigation support service offerings collectively increased million or derived from several large matters related to large  multi national clients 
offsetting the strong revenue achievement from these service offerings was lower revenue performance from our medical coding and records release of medical information service offerings that declined million  or  during increased competition at the local market level was the primary factor driving the decline from prior year 
however  we expect to continue to leverage our market position through a centralized  low cost model more fully integrated with electronic document and data management solutions 
project revenue accounted for of the healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment s revenue in compared to in gross profit gross profit increased from million or of revenue for the year ended december  to million or of revenue for the year ended december  we began productivity initiatives during aimed at lowering the labor component of our production cost structures 
examples of these initiatives include deployment of our high speed scanning solution  development of common production control systems including optical character recognition technology  pay for performance pay strategies  and strategic offshore vendor relationships 
collectively  these initiatives resulted in lower production personnel costs of million when compared with personnel costs 
we also lowered the amount of bad debt expense incurred during our heightened focus for improved accounts receivable collections has benefited operating cash flow and had the effect of lowering bad debt expense million during significant factors offsetting the areas of gross profit improvement were higher employee medical insurance costs in the amount of million and higher worker s compensation and business insurance in the amount of million 
as discussed above in internal investigation  certain revenue generated at an operating subsidiary in our information management and distribution segment has been reversed  resulting in a downward adjustment to certain asset accounts or the recognition of a customer liability or deferred revenue  if the customer has paid the invoices related to the reversed revenue 
notwithstanding the reversal of revenue  the costs associated with the adjusted revenue continues to be reported in the period incurred 
as a result of the reversed revenue  gross margin was negatively impacted in and in selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  our sg a increased primarily from higher personnel costs related to our company wide internal revenue growth initiatives and the technology based productivity initiatives that improved gross profit within our information management and distribution operating segment 
when compared to  personnel costs increased million driving the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue 
income from continuing operations before income taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  contributors to the year over year increase were i factors impacting gross profit and sg a discussed above  ii excess contingent consideration discussed below  and iii lower interest and other expense 
as discussed above  revenue recognition and expense omission issues at an operating subsidiary affected previously paid contingent consideration payments related to the acquisition of the operating subsidiary 
as a result  payments made under the provisions of the earn out agreements that otherwise would not have been made have been expensed in the periods paid resulting in expense of million and million in and  respectively 
interest and other expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower balances on long term obligations  a lower interest rate environment  and the expiration of our interest rate hedge 
the average interest rate on borrowings decreased from in to in our interest rate on borrowings were predominantly variable in nature with the exception of the interest rate hedge which expired during march see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
therefore  interest rate risk exists for our long term obligations at december  increases in short term rates would have the effect of increasing interest expense and lowering operating results in future periods 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations revenue from our services shows no overall significant seasonal variations  however  some seasonality exists at the operating unit level 
further  service revenue can vary from period to period due to the impact of specific projects and the level of transaction volumes sent to us by our customers 
quarterly results may also vary as a result of the timing of acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital  including million of cash 
working capital at december  was million  including million of cash 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in factors contributing to the decline in operating cash flow from continuing operations consist of i lower earnings in the current year  ii slower cash collections during the current year resulting in million of lower cash provided by operating activities  iii the payment of significant legal settlements during the current year totaling million  iv higher annual incentive compensation payments compared to the prior year  v the receipt of income tax refunds of million in the prior year  and vi higher contingent consideration overpayments in the amount of million related to the operating subsidiary under investigation  as more fully described above in internal investigation and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
days sales outstanding increased four business days to business days at december  compared to business days at december  for the year ended december   investing activities from continuing operations consisted of acquisitions of property  plant and equipment of million and net acquisition related payments of million of which million relates to the acquisition of keypoint consulting llc and million represents the settlement of contingent consideration and other acquisition related payments 
partially offsetting the capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions was divestiture proceeds of million  related to the divestiture of our direct mail operations and two medical records management operations 
some future quarters will include additional settlements of contingent consideration on past acquisitions 
not all of the periods applicable for contingent consideration targets have been completed and additional amounts may be payable in future periods under the terms of the agreements based upon the achievement of specified revenue and or earnings targets 
if all contingent consideration targets under the current agreements were achieved  the maximum amount of consideration to be paid would be million  and would be paid in in accordance with the agreements  the company has the option to satisfy the entire million potential liability in common stock with final valuation determined at date of issuance 
net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  borrowings from our line of credit of million were partially offset by payments on our line of credit of million 
additionally  net proceeds from common stock issuances of million were more than offset by payments of million related to shares repurchased 
we utilize our line of credit to fund general operating requirements of the company as well as fund significant investments such as acquisitions or capital expenditures

net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december  we made payments for common stock repurchases of million 
in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
under this program  share repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market as market conditions warrant 
repurchased shares will be retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of the company 
during  we activated the share repurchase program and repurchased  shares at an average cost of per share including  shares repurchased during the three months ended december  at an average price of per share 
additionally  we made payments of million on our line of credit  net of proceeds borrowed from our line of credit of million

acquisition related payments consist of the purchase of uis in the first quarter of and certain other cash payments related to contingent consideration agreements of past acquisitions 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily related to payments of million on our line of credit  net of proceeds borrowed from our line of credit of million 
in april  we entered into a line of credit agreement with bank of america  suntrust bank  and wells fargo bank  as co agents the credit agreement 
under this agreement  we could from time to time borrow up to million through april   subject to certain financial covenants and ratios 
meeting these requirements is highly dependent upon maintaining a minimum level of operating results and the continued demand for our services  among other factors

at december   the remaining commitment under the credit agreement is million and is scheduled to mature as follows in millions maturity date commitment remaining commitment april  april  total as of december  and through march   we are in compliance with loan covenants after giving effect to the amendments and waivers discussed below  which among other things provided for an amended definition of ebitda 
as of december   the availability under the credit agreement was approximately million 
our ability to borrow is contingent on certain leverage and fixed cost coverage ratios 
these ratios were scheduled to become more restrictive beginning in the quarter ended december  with the leverage ratio declining from times to times and the fixed charge coverage ratio increasing from times to times 
however  in september  an amendment was approved that extended the fixed cost coverage ratio requirement of until january  and will increase to at all times thereafter

we entered into a waiver agreement on november  with the lenders party to the credit agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the waiver agreement  the lenders agreed  among other things  to waive any default under the credit agreement that resulted from potential non compliance with a designated fixed charge coverage ratio  and our failure to timely file our quarterly report on form q for the september  quarter 
the waiver agreement also provides that during the period that the waiver agreement is in effect  the outstanding principal amount of the loans under the credit agreement may not exceed  the waiver agreement was to expire on march   however  on march   we entered into on extension and modification of waiver to credit agreement  which extended such waiver through march  the foregoing summary of the extension and modification and waiver to credit agreement is qualified by and should be read in connection with the actual text of the extension and modification of waiver to credit agreement  which is referenced as exhibit to this annual report 
effective march   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement that allows for the exclusion of certain contingent consideration overpayments to the former owners of the operating subsidiary  as described more fully above in internal investigation and in note to the consolidated financial statements  from the definition of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
pursuant to the terms of the company s credit agreement  ebitda is used in calculating certain leverage and fixed cost coverage ratios 
by not having the march  amendment in place  the company was in a default under the credit agreement due to the company exceeding the allowable leverage ratio of times for the quarters ended june  and september  as a result of the contingent consideration overpayments  previously discussed 
as a result  the company classified the debt under such credit agreement as a current maturity included in the current liability section of its balance sheet at june and september  upon entering the march  amendment  the company cured the default under the credit agreement  as such  reclassifying debt under the credit agreement as long term obligations 
in any event  as the maturity date of the debt under the credit agreement is april   unless the maturity date of such debt is subsequently modified  such debt will be classified as a current maturity on and after april  management believes that it has sufficient liquidity from its cash flow and its revolving credit facility to meet ongoing business needs 
additionally  depending on the mix of stock and cash used in our strategic acquisition program  if any  we may need to seek further financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance we could secure such financing if and when it is needed or with terms we deem acceptable 
management fully expects to replace or refinance the credit agreement upon its maturity scheduled for april  in january  we registered on form s registration no 
 shares of common stock for issuance in connection with our acquisition program the acquisition shelf  of which  shares were available as of december   however  such registration statement may require amendment prior to use 
the following table summarizes our total contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year to years to years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations we have total commercial commitments of million for standby letters of credit as of december  we have letters of credit in the amount of million to serve as security for our self insured workmen s compensation program 
we have a million letter of credit to serve as a guarantee for performance under a contract with the new york state workers compensation board 
we have a letter of credit for million to serve as a guarantee for periodic principal and interest payments related to debt 
we expect to pay approximately million to million in interest in critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of opperations are based on the related consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that  as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes to our financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we apply a consistent methodology at the end of each quarter to determine our account balances that require judgmental analysis 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue as it becomes realized or realizable and earned according to the criteria provided by staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
revenue recognition occurs once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or otherwise determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue earnings activities possess both project and recurring customer relationships 
project revenue includes one time projects in which the customer relationship is not expected to continue after project completion 
project revenue is typically based on time and material arrangements 
revenue recognition occurs at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
project revenue represents approximately of total revenues and typically occurs within our healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment 
recurring revenue is characterized by customer relationships that are generally for one year and may continue for longer 
recurring revenue is typically based on the transaction volumes provided by our customer at an agreed upon fixed rate per unit 
our customer s volumes are typically not contractual or otherwise guaranteed 
revenue recognition occurs once work is completed and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
recurring revenue represents the remaining of total revenues and typically occurs within our information management and distribution segment 
revenue recognition policies related to offerings within the our information management and distribution segment are based upon objective criteria that do not require significant estimates or uncertainties 
for example  business process outsourcing services are recognized proportionally as services are rendered  based on specific  objective criteria under the contracts for the number of accounts or transactions processed 
accordingly  revenues recognized under these methods do not require the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change 
revenue recognition policies within our healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment are based upon objective criteria that do not require significant estimates or uncertainties 
for example  transaction volumes and time and costs under time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific  objective criteria under the contracts 
the following outlines specific revenue recognition policies related to certain offerings within this segment medical records release services revenue is recognized upon completion of the processing of the requested medical records 
revenue recognition for this service is based on an agreed upon and in some cases  a regulated rate applied to the number of records processed 
when a fee is paid to the hospital  the revenue related to that fee is reported on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  due to the fact that a the primary obligation in the arrangement is borne partially by both sourcecorp and the hospital  b sourcecorp has no discretion with respect to the supplier of the medical record  and c sourcecorp is not involved in the determination of product or service specifications 
record management services revenue is recognized as storage services are provided based on linear feet of documents stored times a monthly rate for shelf storage and based on a monthly per image rate for images stored electronically 
we recognize fees for processing  retrieval  delivery and return to storage as revenue upon completion of the service at the agreed upon rate applied to the unit count of items serviced 
additional healthcare and compliance services revenue is recognized for document and data conversion services as the services are provided based upon an agreed upon rate per patient file applied to the number of files processed 
storage and archiving fees are recognized as revenue as the services are provided based upon an agreed upon monthly rate per file stored or otherwise archived 
revenue related to coding and abstracting of medical records and staffing services is recognized as the services are provided based on an agreed upon rate applied to the billable hours worked and eligible out of pocket expenses defined by the service agreement 
the out of pocket expense component is recognized as revenue and cost of services on a gross basis in accordance with eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
revenue related to compliance reviews is based primarily on an agreed upon percentage or commission of amounts identified and recovered from the third party payers as a fee for services provided 
revenue is recognized upon successful recovery of underpayments to our clients by their managed care and commercial payers at the agreed upon percentage or commission 
class action claims administration services revenue is recognized as these services are provided based on the agreed upon rate applied to the number of hours spent providing services related to administering the legal settlements and expenses incurred 
the out of pocket expense component is recognized as revenue and cost of services on a gross basis in accordance with eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
in addition  revenue related to the design and implementation of comprehensive notification plans is based on an agreed upon percentage ie commission of the cost to place the media communication 
revenue is recognized at the time of public delivery of the notification through the various media outlets at the agreed upon percentage or commission 
professional economic research and litigation services revenue is recognized as these services are provided based on consulting hours worked at agreed upon rates at the time services are rendered and expenses are incurred 
the out of pocket expense component is recognized as revenue and cost of services on a gross basis in accordance with eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
as a part of providing services to our customers  we incur incidental expenses commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses 
these expenses include items such as airfare  hotels  and mileage and are often reimbursable by our customers 
when reimbursable  we record both revenue and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
unearned income  included in other current liabilities  represents payments from our customers in advance of services being provided 
advanced payments are deferred as unearned income when received and recognized as revenue as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established and maintained based on our estimate of accounts receivable collectibility 
management estimates collectibility by specifically analyzing accounts receivable aging and other historical factors that affect collections 
such factors include the historical trends of write offs and recovery of previously written off accounts  the financial strength of the customer and projected economic and market conditions 
the evaluation of these factors involves subjective judgments and changes in these factors may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets and intangibles impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  management continually evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable 
when events require  management performs the valuation by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets and intangibles to the carrying amount of the asset being evaluated 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of assets being evaluated exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flow based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value 
at december   no events were evident that required valuation for potential impairment 
goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement states that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
the impairment test is based on fair value rather than undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  goodwill and other intangible assets are tested at a reporting unit level rather than the individual operating unit level 
a reporting unit is either at the operating segment level or one reporting level below and could consists of several service offerings aggregated into a single reporting unit 
service offerings are aggregated when they are similar in the following areas economic characteristics  products and services  production processes  methods for distributing or delivering products  and type or class of customers 
valuation methods used in determining fair value include an analysis of the cash flows that the reporting units can be expected to generate in the future income approach and the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to similar publicly traded companies market approach 
in preparing these valuations management utilizes estimates to determine fair value of the reporting units 
these estimates include future cash flows  growth rates  capital needs  and projected earning margins among other factors 
estimates utilized in future calculations could differ from estimates used in the current period 
future years estimates that are unfavorable compared to current estimates could cause an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
due to the fact that we are primarily a services company  our business acquisitions typically result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
therefore  an impairment charge resulting from goodwill or other intangible assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial statements during the period incurred 
self insurance liabilities and reserves 
we are self insured for workmen s compensation liabilities and a significant portion of our employee medical costs 
we account for our self insurance programs based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have not been reported 
these loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
we limit our risk by carrying stop loss policies for significant claims incurred for both workmen s compensation liabilities and medical costs 
other loss contingencies 
we record liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
our loss contingencies consist primarily of estimates related to the probable outcome of current litigation

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb opinion and generally requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award over the requisite service period typically the vesting period 
the standard also requires an entity to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
the company is required to apply sfas no 
r to all awards granted  modified or settled in the first reporting period under us gaap after june  the company is also required to use either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  the company must recognize compensation cost for all awards granted after adopting the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
under the modified retrospective method  the company must restate its previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  the company is permitted to use either a straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
the standard permits and encourages early adoption 
the company has commenced an analysis of the impact of sfas r  but has not yet decided whether to adopt early  if adopted early  then at what date to do so  whether to use the modified prospective method or elect to use the modified retrospective method  and whether to elect to use straight line amortization or an accelerated method 
additionally  the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the number of options that will be unvested and outstanding on the adoption date 
accordingly  the company cannot currently quantify with precision the effect that this standard would have on its financial position or results of operations in the future  except that the company will probably recognize a greater expense for any awards that are granted in the future than if granted under the current guidance 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date this statement is issued 
retroactive application is not permitted 
management is analyzing the requirements of this new statement and believes that its adoption will not have any significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our term loans  revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds 
interest rates are fixed on the capitalized lease obligations 
a basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in approximately million of additional expense in based on our expected average balance outstanding under the credit facility during
