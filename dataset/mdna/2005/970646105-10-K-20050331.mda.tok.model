item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
as of december   the company had a total portfolio of lessees in countries 
its total lease portfolio consisted of engines and related equipment  five aircraft and three spare parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
the company actively manages its portfolio and structures its leases to maximize the residual values of its leased assets 
the company s leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet aircraft engines manufactured by cfmi  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engines 
these engines are the most widely used aircraft engines in the world  powering airbus  boeing  and mcdonnell douglas aircraft 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of its consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  the company does not recognize revenue until received 
the company also estimates and charges to income a provision for bad debts based on its experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the financial condition of the company s customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of the company s customers may adversely affect future lease revenues 
as of december  all of the company s leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  the company retains title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
the company generally depreciates engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for equipment which is unlikely to be repaired at the end of its current expected life  and is likely to be disassembled upon lease termination  the company depreciates the equipment over its estimated life to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
currently  engines having a net book value of million are depreciated using this policy 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by the company  upon sale of the equipment  a loss may be realized 
the company reviews these estimates regularly and a change in either of these estimates would cause an associated change in depreciation expense 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of the company s lease portfolio  the company recognizes the gain or loss associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
additionally  to the extent that any deposits or reserves are not included in the sale and the purchaser of the equipment assumes any liabilities associated therewith  such deposits and reserves are included in the gain on sale 
asset valuation 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of generally be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
impairment is identified by comparison of undiscounted forecast cash flows  including estimated sales proceeds  over the life of the asset with the assets book value 
if the forecast undiscounted cash flows are less than the book value the asset is written down to its fair value 
fair value is determined by reference to independent appraisals  quoted market prices eg an offer to purchase and other factors considered by management 
for further information on these and other accounting policies adopted by the company  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  was based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the company did not undertake any transaction in that would be affected by this statement 
in december  fasb issued sfas r which is a revision to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement also supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
the revised statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met  those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in statement this statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
the cumulative effect of initially applying this statement  if any  is recognized as of the required effective date 
the company has an employee stock option issuance plan described in note of the accompanying financial statements which will be affected by the implementation of this statement 
currently  under the existing statement the company does not recognize compensation cost in respect of its plans and opts to make pro forma disclosure of the impact which is described in note q to its financial statements 
in december  fasb issued a revision of interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r 
application of this interpretation is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities other than small business issuers for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the interpretation was issued to clarify the consolidation requirements of arb opinion no 
consolidated financial statements  especially with respect to variable interest entities 
as of and for the year ended december   the company did not have any interest in any variable interest entities that were required to be accounted for under this interpretation 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its growth through borrowings secured by its equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt 
cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
purchases of equipment including capitalized costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by payments made under the company s lease agreements  which comprise lease revenue and maintenance reserves  and interest expense 
while the company has experienced firmer lease rates  these have been offset by increases in interest rates such that the spread between lease rates and interest rates has remained relatively constant throughout the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while a substantial amount of the company s debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase it is unlikely the company could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in the company s earnings 
revenue and maintenance reserves are also affected by the amount of equipment off lease 
approximately  by book value  of the company s assets were on lease at december   compared to approximately at december   and the average utilization rate for the year ended december   was compared to in the prior year 
if there is any increase in off lease rates or deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reductions in interest rates  there will be a negative impact on earnings and cash flows from operations 
at december   notes payable consists of bank loans totaling million payable over periods of under year to years with interest rates varying between approximately and excluding the effect of the company s interest rate hedges 
the significant facilities are described below 
at december   the company had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   million was available under this facility 
the facility matures in may the interest rate on this facility at december  was month libor plus 
under the revolver facility  all subsidiaries except wlfc ac and willis engine funding llc wef jointly and severally guarantee payment and performance of the terms of the loan agreement 
the maximum guarantee is million plus any accrued and unpaid interest  fees or reimbursements but is limited at any given time to the sum of the principal outstanding plus accrued interest and fees 
the guaranty would be triggered by a default under the agreement 
at december   the company had a fully drawn million debt warehouse facility 
a wholly owned special purpose entity  wef  was created in for the purpose of financing jet aircraft engines 
the facility s revolving period ended march   and commenced a year amortization period during which of the net rents from the collateral are used to pay down principal  followed by a final balloon payment 
the facility s structure is designed to facilitate the issuance of public or private securitized notes 
there is no assurance that a securitization can be completed or completed on terms that are favorable or acceptable to the company 
refer to factors that may affect future results for further discussion of the risks the company faces 
the facility notes are divided into million class a notes and million class b notes 
the company provides a guaranty to the class b noteholders 
if wef defaults on its obligations  the full amount of the class b notes outstanding together with any accrued interest and fees is due and payable immediately 
the governing documents of the warehouse facility and the wef operating agreement require that the assets of wef and any associated owner trust are not available to satisfy the obligations of the company or any of its affiliates 
wef is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
at december   interest on the class a notes is a commercial paper rate plus a weighted average spread of and interest on the class b notes is month libor plus a weighted average spread of at december   the company had warehouse and revolving credit facilities totaling million compared to million at december  at december  and  respectively  million and million was available under these combined facilities 
at december   the company had an million term loan facility available to a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of the company  wlfc ac inc  for the financing of jet aircraft engines sold by the company to such subsidiary 
the facility is a five year term loan with final maturity of june  the interest rate is month libor plus 
this facility is fully drawn 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of wlfc ac under the terms of this facility 
at december   month libor was approximately and the commercial paper rate was approximately 
at december   the rates were approximately and  respectively 
approximately million of the company s debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the table below summarizes the company s contractual commitments at december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total approximately million of the above debt is subject to the company continuing to comply with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  the company can typically borrow of an engine purchase and only between to of an aircraft or spare parts purchase under these facilities  so the company must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or it will not be permitted to draw on these facilities 
the facilities are also cross defaulted 
if the company does not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  the company may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  debt is secured by engines on lease to customers and to the extent that engines are returned from lease early or are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be accelerated 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the company has commitments to purchase  during  engines and other engine related equipment totaling million 
the company s lease of its office premises in sausalito expires on december   but it has given notice that it may exercise its option to extend the lease for at least one further year 
the sublease of company premises in san diego expires in october the lease of office space in shanghai  china expires in june the company also holds a interest  accounted for under the cost method  in a joint venture in china  sichuan snecma aero engine maintenance co 
ltd 
the company has invested million to date 
the company believes its equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain the company s level of operations through a decline in the level of internally generated funds such as could result if off lease rates increase or a decrease in availability under the company s existing debt facilities would impair the company s ability to sustain its level of operations 
the company is discussing additions to its capital base with its commercial and investment banks 
if the company is not able to access additional capital  its ability to continue to grow its asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and its future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
management of interest rate exposure at december   million of the company s borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to libor or commercial paper rates 
the company s equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate that the company pays under its borrowings 
to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  with remaining terms of between and months and fixed rates of between and 
during  the company purchased a number of forward commencing caps with notional amounts totaling million  terms of years  effective dates which commenced in and rates capped at 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and was positive million  representing an asset of the company and negative million  representing a liability of the company 
the fair value of the caps at december  was zero compared to positive  at december   representing an asset of the company 
interest expense for the year ended december   was increased due to the company s interest rate hedges by approximately million compared to million in the comparable period in for the year ended december   interest expense was increased due to the company s interest rate hedges by approximately million 
the company will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
the company anticipates that it may hedge additional amounts of its floating rate debt during the next year

forward looking statements give the company s expectations about the future and are not guarantees 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and the company does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report or in other written or oral statements by the company 
the business in which the company is engaged is capital intensive 
accordingly  the company s ability to successfully execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations is dependent  in large part  on the availability of debt and equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital  or to renew its credit facilities could result in increased funding costs and would limit the company s ability to i add new equipment to its portfolio  ii fund its working capital needs  and iii finance possible future acquisitions 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company retains title to the equipment that it leases to third parties 
upon termination of a lease  the company will seek to re lease or sell the equipment 
the company also engages in the selective purchase and resale of commercial aircraft engines 
on occasion  the company purchases engines without having a firm commitment for their lease or sale 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell equipment on a timely basis  including the following i general market conditions  ii the condition of the equipment upon termination of the lease  iii the maintenance services performed during the lease term and  as applicable  the number of hours remaining until the next major maintenance is required  iv regulatory changes particularly those imposing environmental  maintenance and other requirements on the operation of aircraft engines  v changes in the supply of  or demand for  or cost of aircraft engines  and vi technological developments 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to re lease or sell equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
the failure to re lease aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms or sell aircraft equipment on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in its operating results 
such fluctuations may be due to a number of factors  including i general economic conditions  ii the timing of sales of engines  iii financial difficulties experienced by airlines  iv interest rates  v downturns in the air transportation industry  vi changes in fuel prices vii unanticipated early lease termination or a default by a lessee  viii the timing of engine acquisitions  ix engine marketing activities  x fluctuations in market prices for the company s assets  xi downward pressure on lease rates  and xii other terrorism and geo political risks 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
as a result  the company believes that comparisons to results of operations for preceding periods are not necessarily meaningful and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
as of december   approximately by value of the company s equipment available for lease was either off lease  on month to month leases or on leases expiring in at december   approximately by value of the company s equipment was similarly categorized 
the ability of the company to successfully remarket this equipment will have a significant impact on the company s future results and on its ability to draw under certain of its credit facilities 
a lessee may default in performance of its lease obligations and the company may be unable to enforce its remedies under a lease 
the company s inability to collect receivables due under a lease or to repossess aircraft equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
various airlines have experienced financial difficulties in the past  certain airlines have filed for bankruptcy and a number of such airlines have ceased operations 
in the united states where a debtor seeks protection under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code  creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights 
in the case of united states certificated airlines  section of the bankruptcy code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment 
the scope of section has been the subject of significant litigation and there is no assurance that the provisions of section will protect the company s investment in an aircraft  aircraft engines or parts in the event of a lessee s bankruptcy 
in addition  section does not apply to lessees located outside of the united states and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection 
leases of spare parts may involve additional risks 
for example  it is likely to be more difficult to recover parts in the event of a lessee default and the residual value of parts may be less ascertainable than an engine 
the company s leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms while the majority of the company s borrowings are at floating rates 
increases in interest rates could narrow  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate the company pays under its borrowings  and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
for the twelve months ended december   of the company s lease revenue in  the percentage was was generated by leases to non us customers 
such international leases may present greater risks to the company because certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the united states 
all leases require payment in us dollars 
if the lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making their lease payments 
the company is also subject to the timing and access to courts and the remedies local laws impose in order to collect its lease payments and recover its assets 
in addition  political instability abroad and changes in international policy also present risk of expropriation of the company s leased engines 
furthermore  many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage its existing or the possible future expansion of its operations  or that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations  in which event the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company may also acquire businesses that would complement or expand the company s existing businesses 
any acquisition or expansion made by the company may result in one or more of the following events i the incurrence of additional debt  ii future charges to earnings related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  iii difficulties in the assimilation of operations  services  products and personnel  iv an inability to sustain or improve historical revenue levels  v diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations  and vi potential loss of key employees 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the markets for the company s products and services are extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of sources 
these include aircraft engine and aircraft parts manufacturers  aircraft and aircraft engine lessors  aircraft and engine service and repair companies and aircraft spare parts distributors 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including greater name recognition  a broader range of engines  complementary lines of business and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
in addition  equipment manufacturers  and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the markets that the company serves  thereby significantly increasing industry competition 
there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company s leasing activities generate significant depreciation allowances that provide the company with substantial tax benefits on an ongoing basis 
in addition  the company s lessees enjoy favorable accounting and tax treatment by entering into operating leases 
the company also benefits from the extraterritorial income exclusion regulations which significantly reduce the company s effective tax rate 
as a result of recent legislation this benefit is being phased out over the next three years and the company s effective tax rate will increase 
other changes to tax laws or accounting principles that make operating lease financing less attractive or affect the company s recognition of revenue or expense would have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
as a public company  willis lease is subject to certain regulatory requirements including  but not limited to  compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of such compliance results in significant additional costs to the company both directly  through increased audit and consulting fees  and indirectly  through the time required by management to address the regulations 
however  the sec has recently delayed the implementation date of section for non accelerated filers until such costs will likely have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
in september  the company acquired a canadair challenger a aircraft for general corporate purposes and for charter to third parties 
the company expects that annual ownership costs will be approximately million with additional operating costs depending on usage 
the company has also negotiated a management contract which should generate net charter revenues of approximately million per annum depending on usage that will reduce overall cost 
however there can be no assurance that these revenues will be realized 
the company obtains a substantial portion of its engines and aircraft from airlines  overhaul facilities and other suppliers 
there is no organized market for engines and aircraft 
the company relies on its representatives  advertisements and its reputation in order to generate opportunities to purchase such equipment 
the market for bulk sales of engines and aircraft is highly competitive  in some instances involving a bidding process 
while the company has been able to purchase engines and aircraft in this manner successfully in the past  there is no assurance that engines and aircraft will be available on acceptable terms or that the company will continue to compete effectively in the purchase of such equipment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk
