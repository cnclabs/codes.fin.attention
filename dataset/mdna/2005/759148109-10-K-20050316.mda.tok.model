item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  we primarily derived our revenue from our program management services segment  which includes inpatient programs both acute rehabilitation and skilled nursing units  outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs and from healthcare management consulting 
prior to  we also derived a significant portion of our revenue from our healthcare staffing segment 
on february   we consummated the sale of the starmed staffing division to intelistaf holdings  inc and received approximately of the equity of intelistaf in return 
after the consummation date  the financial condition and results of operations of the staffing division were no longer consolidated in our financial statements and our interest in intelistaf has been accounted for under the equity method

revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payers 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with hospitals and skilled nursing facilities 
during the three year period ended december   we experienced annual declines in patient days of between and reflecting the continued trend of reduced inpatient rehabilitation lengths of stay 
under the per diem billing method used in and in all prior years all prior to the prospective payment system for rehabilitation units in hospitals our revenues would have been adversely affected by this trend  however  during we transitioned the majority of our contracts to a per discharge billing method mitigating the aforementioned negative impact 
the per discharge billing method is now our preferred method as it aligns our interests with those of our hospital clients who bill government programs using a similar approach 
material changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements to our clients for services rendered in the programs that we manage could give us or our clients the right to renegotiate existing contracts to include terms that are more or less favorable to us 
an example of a change in method includes the change in contracting methodology discussed above which changed from a per diem billing approach to a per discharge approach for a significant number of our contracts 
an example of a change in government reimbursement is the modified rule as described in detail in the reimbursement section of the business overview in part i of this form k 
we estimate that this new rule had a negative impact of approximately  on revenues in the fourth quarter of furthermore  we believe the new rule may prevent us from achieving our historical same store growth rates in the immediate future

hospital rehabilitation services 
the march  acquisition of vitalcare contributed million of revenue in this increase and an increase in average revenue per location were offset by a decline in the average number of units  excluding those added by the vitalcare acquisition  operated during the average number of outpatient units managed in fiscal year declined from fiscal year this decline was the result of closures of certain smaller  less profitable units and from greater competition from physician practices 
the average revenue per location in the outpatient business increased year over year from million to million 
overall  the average number of hospital rehabilitation services locations managed by the division increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the average revenue per unit in the inpatient business remained flat at million per location 
a increase in same store discharges was offset by lower revenues per unit at the vitalcare units acquired in and at facilities opened during the year due to typical new unit ramp up 
contract therapy 
the increase in contract therapy revenues can be attributed to both strong business development efforts and to the million of additional revenue attributable to the acquisitions of cpr therapies and cornerstone rehabilitation in the average number of contract therapy locations  including those acquired during  managed by the division during the period increased from in the twelve months ended december  to in the twelve months ended december  the average revenue per location increased year over year from  to  this increase was the result of strong growth in the division s same store revenues for the periods being compared  however  some of this growth was offset by the termination of several large  mature programs in the second quarter of and the smaller average size of the sixty cpr therapies facilities purchased in february and fifty cornerstone rehabilitation facilities purchased in december cost and expenses of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses   division selling  general and administrative   corporate selling  general and administrative   restructuring charge   loss on assets held for sale  depreciation and amortization   gain on sale of business total costs and expenses   the ratios of operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were significantly affected by the sale of our healthcare staffing division 
historically  the healthcare staffing division s operating and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of division revenues were higher than our other divisions 
as a result  with the divestiture of that division  we experienced improvements in those ratios on a year over year basis 
however  despite a million or reduction in corporate selling  general and administrative expenses  the consolidated ratio of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses to revenue deteriorated as corporate overheads were allocated over the remaining operating units 
total depreciation and amortization expense was flat year over year as lower depreciation and amortization resulting from the divestiture of the healthcare staffing division was offset by increased amortization on intangible assets relating to the acquisitions of cpr  vitalcare and cornerstone and the write off of a software license that we no longer have plans to use 
the gain on sale of business and loss on assets held for sale both pertain to the sale of the healthcare staffing division 
in  the net assets of that division were written down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
when the division was sold in  a gain was recognized representing the net impact of changes in the underlying asset and liability values and adjustments to the estimated costs to sell 
in july  we announced a comprehensive multifaceted restructuring program to return us to growth and improved profitability 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recognized a pre tax restructuring expense of million for severance  outplacement and exit costs 
in connection with the sale of our healthcare staffing division in february  we initiated a series of restructuring activities to reduce the cost of corporate overhead that had previously been absorbed by the staffing division 
these activities included the elimination of approximately positions  exiting a portion of leased office space at our corporate headquarters and the write off of certain abandoned leasehold improvements associated with the office space consolidation 
in addition  we modified the term of the stock options of certain starmed employees to allow them additional time to exercise vested options 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million

the improvement in the ratio of direct operating expenses to division revenue is primarily due to lower direct operating expenses at the vitalcare units and an increase in management only contracts versus full staffing agreements  partially offset by an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal year as a result of our normal assessment of payment risk 
division selling  general  and administrative costs increased as a percentage of revenue as savings resulting from the consolidation of inpatient and outpatient overhead activities were offset by higher general and administrative expenses associated with vitalcare operations 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues declined slightly as a result of a decline in the allocation of software amortization to the division  partially offset by an increase in amortization of certain intangible assets associated with the acquisition of vitalcare 
the net effect of revenue growth  overall cost control improvements at the divisional level  and the absorption of additional corporate overhead during the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  was a million decline in hospital rehabilitation service s operating earnings from million to million 
contract therapy 
total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses resulting from the increased number of contract therapy locations being managed by the division 
as a percentage of net revenues  the division s direct operating expenses decreased year over year 
part of this improvement was due to the moratorium put on the medicare part b caps in december in addition to the benefit from the moratorium  the division also saw reductions in wages and wage related expenses  as a percentage of revenues  through improvements in therapist productivity and reduced benefit costs 
offsetting a portion of these improvements was an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts in to mitigate some of the risk associated with a few specific accounts in our receivables portfolio 
contract therapy has continued to leverage its division selling  general and administrative costs  which decreased as a percentage of revenues from to much of the division s growth has occurred in markets where there are already existing programs  making it easier to manage more programs per manager  thereby increasing selling  general and administrative wages at a rate considerably less than the rate revenues have increased 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased year over year due to the amortization of the division s proprietary information system implemented in the second half of  and the amortization related to certain intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of cpr and cornerstone 
the net effect of the revenue growth  overall cost control improvements at the divisional level and the absorption of additional corporate overhead during the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  was a million increase in contract therapy s operating earnings from million to million 
non operating items interest income increased by million from million in to million in  primarily due to higher average invested balances and some increase in interest rates in the second half of the year 
interest expense in primarily consists of interest related to subordinated promissory notes issued in connection with the cpr  vitalcare and conerstone acquisitions  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit  letter of credit fees and amortization of deferred loan origination fees 
compared to  interest expense in increased as a result of the issuance of the subordinated promissory notes  higher amounts of letters of credit to support insurance programs and the write off of approximately million of deferred loan origination fees as a result of replacing our line of credit which  was scheduled to expire in august we had no outstanding balance against our line of credit as of december  and december  the provision for income taxes in was an expense of million compared to a benefit of million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the effective rates for both and were significantly impacted by a component of the loss on the sale of the starmed staffing division related to goodwill  which was not deductible for tax purposes 
diluted earnings per share was in compared to diluted loss per share of in this improvement was principally the result of improved contribution margins during as well as the million after tax impairment charge in related to the net assets held for sale in our former staffing division 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues consolidated operating revenues in decreased million or to million as compared to million in revenue increases in contract therapy and hospital rehabilitation services were more than offset by revenue declines in healthcare staffing 
hospital rehabilitation services revenues  consisting of hospital inpatient and outpatient programs  increased by million to million in  or from million in inpatient revenues increased million  or from million in to million in revenue per program increased  offsetting a decline in the average number of programs operated 
growth in revenue per program is a result of the average number of discharges per unit increasing year over year 
outpatient revenues remained flat year over year  reflecting an decrease in the average number of programs operated  offset by a increase in revenue per outpatient program 
growth in outpatient revenue per program is a result of termination of a number of smaller contracts with limited long term opportunity and a increase in average patient visits per location 
contract therapy revenue increased by from million in to million in despite the negative revenue impact of the medicare part b therapy caps that were in effect from september through december of the primary driver of this increase was the success in the division s sales efforts  which increased the average number of contract therapy programs managed from in to in also contributing to the revenue increase was a increase in the average revenue per location from approximately  to approximately  resulting from same store growth and the continued focus on opening larger programs 
healthcare staffing revenues decreased  or million in  from million in to million in including million inter company sales at market rates to the hospital rehabilitation services and contract therapy divisions 
supplemental staffing revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  reflecting the impact of branch consolidations in the first quarter of driven by a decline in the demand for staffing agency services 
the average number of branch locations decreased  from in to in the decrease in supplemental staffing revenues is attributable to a decrease in weeks worked as a result of the consolidation of branch locations and a decline in demand  offset by a increase in average revenue per week worked 
the increase in average revenue per week worked was a result of placing more highly credentialed staff  such as registered nurses  as compared to certified nurse assistants  as well as increased bill rates for the certified nurse assistants 
travel staffing revenues decreased by from million in to million in primarily as a result of a decrease in weeks worked 
revenue per week worked improved slightly by 
the decline in weeks worked was driven by a decrease in demand for travelers while the increase in revenue per week is a result of increases in rates within nurse and therapist placements offset by a shift in sales mix to more radiologists  which saw a decrease in revenue per week worked 
cost and expenses consolidated operating expenses in decreased by million or to million compared to million in as a percentage of sales  operating expenses excluding provision for doubtful accounts increased to in versus in  primarily reflecting the migration of the skill mix in the staffing division to more highly credentialed professionals  lower productivity in the contract therapy division due to a complex information system conversion during the third quarter of and increased labor  benefit and insurance costs in all divisions 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of operating revenues decreased from in to in due primarily to improvement in the aging categories of the staffing division s accounts receivable primarily during the first half of the year 
division selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues decreased from in to in primarily due to reductions of costs  as a percent of division operating revenues in contract therapy  the outpatient division of hospital rehabilitation services and healthcare staffing  partially offset by increases in the inpatient division of hospital rehabilitation services 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses of million in were flat year over year compared to  but increased as a percentage of operating revenues to in compared to in the increase as a percentage of operating revenues was primarily attributable to increased costs for the arrangements entered into during the second quarter of with phase consulting  inc and the former president and ceo of the company 
under the terms of the phase agreement  we paid a monthly fee of  and reimbursement of business expenses 
in addition  phase earned an incentive fee of  based on predetermined performance standards 
the consulting agreement with the former ceo continued his monthly compensation and car allowance of approximately  until june in addition  we incurred higher legal fees during to research and comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services rule 
these cost increases were offset by cost decreases resulting from tighter cost controls instituted in the second half of the year combined with the favorable impact of restructuring activities initiated during the third quarter 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from due to depreciation expense recorded on additional capital expenditures 
on july   we announced a comprehensive  multifaceted restructuring program to help return the company to growth and improved profitability 
as part of the restructuring program  we eliminated positions in an effort to reduce corporate support functions and better align corporate overhead with the operating divisions 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recognized a pretax restructuring charge of million 
included in this restructuring charge is million of severance and outplacement costs and million for exit costs related to the closing of five starmed branches 
the restructuring charge was reflected as a separate component of costs and expenses for on december   we announced that we had entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement with intelistaf pursuant to which intelistaf would acquire our healthcare staffing division in exchange for approximately of the common stock of intelistaf on a fully diluted basis 
this transaction subsequently closed on february  in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets and liabilities of the healthcare staffing operation were reported on our december  consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities held for sale and were measured at their net fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we recognized a pretax impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with the staffing division and to accrue estimated selling costs 
this impairment loss was recorded as a separate component of our costs and expenses for in the hospital rehabilitation services division  direct operating expenses excluding provision for doubtful accounts increased by  or million  primarily reflecting increased salaries and salary related expenses in both inpatient and outpatient divisions as a result of higher workers compensation  professional liability and health insurance expenses 
provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of operating revenues increased from in to for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the normal evaluation of the creditworthiness of our clients 
in the hospital rehabilitation services division  divisional selling  general  and administrative expense fell million  or  as a result of our third quarter restructuring and combination of the inpatient and outpatient divisions 
corporate general and administrative expenses allocated to the division increased million  or  to million in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of operating revenues  declined slightly year over year 
contract therapy direct operating expenses excluding provisions for doubtful accounts increased from million in to million in  which was due primarily to the increased number of contract therapy locations being managed by the division 
as a percentage of net revenues  the division s direct operating expenses increased from of net revenues in to of net revenues in contributing to this increase in direct operating expenses was higher wages paid as a result of the tightening therapist labor market  as well as utilization of higher cost contract labor 
in addition  productivity was negatively affected in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter due to problems encountered during the implementation of our proprietary information system 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of operating revenues increased from of operating revenues in to in as a result of our on going review of accounts receivable risk 
contract therapy s division selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in as the division increased revenues at a faster rate than its selling  general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses  which represent allocations of corporate office expenses based upon utilization by divisions  increased slightly as a percentage of operating revenues from to 
depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of operating revenues  remained flat at of operating revenues year over year 
in the staffing division  direct operating expenses excluding provision for doubtful accounts decreased  or million  due to the decrease in weeks worked  offset by changes within certain operating expense categories as described below 
gross profit margins in the supplemental staffing division decreased from in to in  while gross profit margins in the travel division decreased in to compared to in the decrease in gross profit margin in the supplemental staffing division is primarily the result of increases in workers compensation  professional and general liability and medical insurance claims cost 
the decrease in gross profit margin within the travel staffing division was a result of changes to bonuses paid to travelers  market pricing decreases in radiologist bill rates and increases in workers compensation and professional and general liability 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased million in compared to  primarily as a result of the normal evaluation of the creditworthiness of our clients showing improvement in accounts receivable aging 
division selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or as a result of branch consolidations in the first quarter of and decreases in administrative personnel 
this resulted in a decrease in divisional selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues from in to in corporate general and administrative expenses  which represent allocations of corporate office expenses based upon utilization by divisions  decreased for the division as a percentage of operating revenues from to 
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of operating revenues increased from in to in primarily due to similar expense on less revenue 
non operating items interest income decreased by million from million in to million in  primarily due to lower interest rates 
interest expense primarily represents commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit and letter of credit fees 
compared to  interest expense in increased very slightly as a result of higher amounts of letters of credit to support insurance programs 
we had no outstanding balance against our line of credit as of december  and december  the provision for income taxes in was a benefit of million compared to an expense of million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the effective rate for was significantly impacted by a component of the loss on net assets held for sale related to goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
diluted loss per share was in compared to diluted earnings per share of in this decline was principally the result of the million after tax impairment charge in related to the net assets held for sale of our staffing division and the significant decline in demand for staffing agency services 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of million and a current ratio  the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to working capital decreased by million to million as of december  as compared to million as of december  this decrease is primarily the result of an increase in the current portion of long term debt attributable to the acquisitions of cpr  vitalcare and cornerstone  increased accounts payable resulting primarily from computer software and hardware acquisitions near year end and increased accrued salaries and wages primarily for incentive accruals 
the number of days average net revenue in net receivables was and adjusted to exclude receivables related to the staffing division at december  and  respectively 
operating cash flows constitute our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion and debt service requirements 
we expect to meet our future working capital  capital expenditures  internal and external business expansion and debt service requirements from a combination of internal sources and outside financing 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  na bank national association  harris trust and savings bank  national city bank  comerica bank and suntrust bank  as participating banks in the lending group 
the amended and restated credit agreement is an expandable million  five year revolving credit facility that replaces our former million revolving line of credit  dated august   which was scheduled to expire in august the new revolving credit facility is expandable to million upon our notice to the lending group  subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement 
the new credit facility features reduced bank fees and interest rate spreads and significantly enhances our financial flexibility 
at december  and  we had no balance outstanding against our line of credit 
we have approximately million in letters of credit issued to insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims 
the letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the line of credit 
we also have a million promissory note issued to our workers compensation carrier as additional collateral 
the promissory note is not recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet as it only becomes payable upon an event of default as defined in the security agreement with the workers compensation carrier 
finally  as additional collateral  we have a trust agreement with our professional and general liability insurance carrier under which we have deposited million for their benefit in an escrow account 
our access to these funds is restricted and the insurance carrier may only draw on these funds in the event of a default as defined in the trust agreement 
as part of the purchases of cpr  vitalcare and cornerstone  we issued long term subordinated promissory notes to the respective selling parties 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from 
as of december   approximately million of these notes remained outstanding 
in addition  as part of our arrangement with signature healthcare foundation  we extended a million line of credit to signature 
at december   signature had drawn approximately million against this line of credit 
in connection with the development and implementation of additional programs  including developing joint venture relationships  we may incur capital expenditures for acquisitions of property  renovations  equipment and deferred costs to begin operations 
in addition  we expect to expend capital to implement our acquisition strategy 
during  we expended approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of new businesses 
these funds were all derived from cash generated from operations 
inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole 
our management contracts typically provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board enacted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement r which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees using a fair value based method and the recognition of such fair value as expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the provisions of statement r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  accordingly adoption of this standard is required for our third fiscal period in  earlier adoption is encouraged 
if we were to adopt the provisions of statement r on january   based on our current estimates  we would recognize equity compensation expense  net of tax benefits  of between to million in this estimate is based on continuing to expense amounts computed under the provisions of statement for options granted prior to the adoption of statement r and an estimate of the expense that will be recognized for new options that we expect to grant during this estimate is subject to change based on the actual grants of stock options in and the fair value of those stock options as determined on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board enacted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions statement 
statement eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of statement will have on our consolidated results and financial condition but we do not expect it to have a material impact 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments  exclusive of interest  as of december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years other operating leases    purchase obligations   long term debt    other long term liabilities   total     we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees 
under the plan  participants may defer up to of their base cash compensation 
the amounts are held in trust in designated investments and remain our property until distribution 
because distribution of funds is at the election of the participants  we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
at december   we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health  workers compensation and professional liability claims 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets  both tangible and intangible  based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss would be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
on december   we announced that we had entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement with intelistaf pursuant to which intelistaf would acquire our healthcare staffing division  in exchange for approximately of the common stock of intelistaf on a fully diluted basis 
this transaction subsequently closed on february  in accordance with the requirements of statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets and liabilities of our healthcare staffing operation were reported on our december  consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities held for sale and were measured at their net fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with the staffing division and to accrue estimated selling costs 
this impairment loss was computed in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
we engaged a third party valuation firm to assist us in determining the fair value of consideration given and received in the contemplated transaction with intelistaf 
this value  less estimated costs to sell  was compared to the carrying value of the healthcare staffing division to ascertain if any impairment existed 
because the estimated fair value less costs to sell was less than the carrying value of the staffing business  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the implied fair value of goodwill and in turn the amount of impairment 
the impairment loss was recorded as a separate component of costs and expenses in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december  as required by statement no 
 we also conducted an annual impairment assessment of goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services  contract therapy and healthcare management consulting businesses and determined that goodwill is not impaired 
the test required comparison of the estimated fair value of these businesses to our book value 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
if an impairment loss should occur in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
at december   unamortized goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services  contract therapy and healthcare management consulting businesses was million  million and million  respectively 
health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accruals 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
in analyzing the accruals  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
we account for our equity investment in intelistaf holdings  inc using the provisions of apb opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
our investment in intelistaf was initially recorded at cost and we have since adjusted the carrying amount of the investment for our share of intelistaf s losses after the date of acquisition 
in accordance with the provisions of apb  we must assess whether factors exist that may indicate a decrease in the value of our investment has occurred that is other than temporary 
during  intelistaf incurred operating losses and the healthcare staffing industry as a whole continued a cyclical downturn 
accordingly  we concluded that an assessment was warranted to determine whether an other than temporary loss of value in our investment had occurred 
we performed this assessment using several valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings  revenues and cash flows 
additionally  we reviewed qualitative and quantitative evidence  both positive and negative  to assess whether a decline in value  if any  was other than temporary 
based on this analysis  we concluded there has not been an other than temporary decline in the value of our equity investment in intelistaf and we made no adjustment to the carrying value of our investment  which is million at december  we will continue to monitor the valuation of our investment in intelistaf and will update our analysis as circumstances warrant 
we believe the assumptions used in our analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our analysis and in turn reflect a reduction in the carrying value of our investment and result in a charge to our statement of earnings 
if such a reduction in investment value should occur in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our net earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our borrowing capacity consists of a line of credit with interest rates that fluctuate based upon market indexes 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
as such  risk relating to interest rate fluctuations is considered minimal
