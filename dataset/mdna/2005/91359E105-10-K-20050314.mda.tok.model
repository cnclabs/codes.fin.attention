forward looking statements and certain risk factors the matters discussed in this report  as well as the news releases issued from time to time by us  include certain statements containing the words believes  anticipates  intends  expects and words of similar import  which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 

table of contents such factors include  among other things  the following a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent upon one operator  universal health services  inc  uhs  uhs is our advisor and our officers are all employees of uhs which may create the potential for conflicts of interest  a substantial portion of our leases are involved in the healthcare industry which continues to undergo change and is subject to possible changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement from third party payors and government reimbursement programs  including medicare and medicaid  we cannot predict whether the leases on our properties  including the leases on the properties leased to subsidiaries of uhs  which have options to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease or renewal terms at the appraised fair market value  will be renewed at their current rates at the end of the lease terms 
if the leases are not renewed  we may be required to find other operators for these facilities and or enter into leases with less favorable terms 
if the uhs facilities are purchased by the lessees at the end of the lease term  the economic return earned by us on the sale proceeds may be less favorable than the rental revenue currently earned on the facilities  our ability to finance our growth on favorable terms  liability and other claims asserted against us or operators of our facilities  the fact that we have majority ownership interests in various llcs in which we hold non controlling equity interests  a large portion of our non hospital properties consist of medical office buildings which are either directly or indirectly affected by the factors discussed herein as well as general real estate factors such as the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates  as well as an increase in the development of medical office condominiums in certain markets  the operators of our facilities  including uhs  are confronted with other issues such as industry capacity  demographic changes  existing laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with laws and governmental regulations  the ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms  an increase in uninsured and self pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectibility of patient accounts  competition by other healthcare providers  including physician owned facilities  decreasing inpatient admission trends  the loss of significant customers  technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing  or reduce the demand for healthcare  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including physicians  operators of our facilities  particularly uhs  have experienced a significant increase in property insurance expense including earthquake insurance in california and general and professional liability insurance expense and as a result  certain operators have assumed a greater portion of their liability risk and there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in claims asserted against the operators of our facilities  which are self insured  will not have a material adverse effect on their future results of operations  and  other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  in certain markets  including mcallen  texas  the site of our largest facility  competition from other healthcare providers  including physician owned facilities  has increased and additional inpatient capacity at a physician owned hospital opened in late a continuation of the increased provider competition in the markets in which our hospital facilities operate  including mcallen  texas  could have an adverse effect on the net revenues and financial results of the operators of our hospital facilities which may negatively impact the bonus rentals earned by us on these facilities and may potentially have a negative impact on the underlying value of the properties 

table of contents in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit we must comply with certain highly technical and complex internal revenue service requirements 
although we intend to remain so qualified  there may be facts and circumstances beyond our control that may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
failure to qualify as a reit may subject us to income tax liabilities  including federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
the additional income tax incurred may significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to shareholders and for debt service 
in addition  if disqualified  we might be barred from qualification as a reit for four years following disqualification 
although we believe we have been qualified as a reit since our inception  there can be no assurance that we have been so qualified or will remain qualified in the future 
management is unable to predict the effect  if any  these factors will have on our operating results or our lessees  including the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs 
given these uncertainties  prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
management of the trust disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note to the financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition revenue is recognized on the accrual basis of accounting 
our revenues consist primarily of rentals received from tenants  which are comprised of minimum rent base rentals  bonus rentals and reimbursements from tenants for their pro rata share of expenses such as common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and utilities 
the minimum rent for all hospital facilities is fixed over the initial term or renewal term of the respective leases 
minimum rent for other material leases is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term regardless of when payments are due 
bonus rents are recognized when earned based upon increases in each facility s net revenue in excess of stipulated amounts 
bonus rentals are determined and paid each quarter based upon a computation that compares the respective facility s current quarter s revenue to the corresponding quarter in the base year 
tenant reimbursements for operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred 
investments in limited liability companies llcs our consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of our controlled investments and those investments that meet the criteria of a variable interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary as a result of our level of investment in the entity 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for investments in real estate ventures and emerging issues task force issue  investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  we account for our unconsolidated investments in llcs which we do not control using the equity method of accounting 
these investments  which represent to non controlling ownership interests  are recorded initially at our cost and subsequently adjusted for our net equity in the net income  cash contributions to and distributions from the investments 
rental income recorded by the llcs relating to leases in excess of one year in length  is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rents are recognized evenly over the lease term regardless of when payments are due 
the amount of rental revenue resulting from straight line rent adjustments is dependent 
table of contents on many factors including the nature and amount of any rental concessions granted to new tenants  scheduled rent increases under existing leases  as well as the acquisitions and sales of properties that have existing in place leases with terms in excess of one year 
as a result  the straight line adjustments to rental revenue may vary from period to period 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation  as revised fin r  addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
effective march   we adopted fin r 
as a result of our related party relationship with uhs  and certain master lease  lease assurance or lease guarantee arrangements between uhs and various properties owned by three llcs in which we own a or non controlling ownership interest  these llcs are considered to be variable interest entities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are the primary beneficiary of these llc investments as a result of our level of investment in the entities 
consequently  we began consolidating the results of operations of these three llc investments 
included on our december  consolidated balance sheet are the i assets  ii liabilities  iii third party borrowings  which are non recourse to us  and  iv minority interests  of these three llc investments 
also as a consequence of fin r  beginning on april   we began consolidating the results of operations of these llc investments on our consolidated statements of income 
there was no impact on our net income as a result of the consolidation of these llcs 
the remaining llcs are not variable interest entities and therefore are not subject to the consolidation requirements of fin r 
federal income taxes no provision has been made for federal income tax purposes since we qualify as a real estate investment trust under sections to of the internal revenue code of  and intend to continue to remain so qualified 
as such  we are exempt from federal income taxes and we are required to distribute at least of our real estate investment taxable income to our shareholders 
we are subject to a federal excise tax computed on a calendar year basis 
the excise tax equals of the amount by which of our ordinary income plus of any capital gain income for the calendar year exceeds cash distributions during the calendar year  as defined 
no provision for excise tax has been reflected in the financial statements as no tax was due 
earnings and profits  which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders  will differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal tax purposes in the cost basis of assets and in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation and the recording of provision for investment losses

although the facility has not experienced significant business interruption  our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december   includes a property write down charge of million representing the estimated net book value of the damaged assets

funds from operations  is a widely recognized measure of reit performance 
although ffo is a non gaap financial measure  we believe that information regarding ffo is helpful to shareholders and potential investors 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  or that interpret the nareit definition differently than we interpret the definition 
to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income determined in accordance with gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap

year ended december  funds from operations net income plus depreciation and amortization consolidated investments unconsolidated affiliates less gain on llc s sale of real property funds from operations effects of inflation although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years  the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
operators of our hospital facilities are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses which has caused and may continue to cause an increase  in excess of the inflation rate  in salaries  wages and benefits expense 
in addition  due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets  the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly 
as a result  certain operators of our hospital facilities  including all of the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs  assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk 
we cannot predict the ability of the operators of our facilities to continue to cover future cost increases 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these trends will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations of the operators of our facilities which may affect their ability to make lease payments to us 
most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
our hospital leases require all building operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes and other costs  to be paid by the lessee 
in addition  certain of the hospital leases contain bonus rental provisions  which require the lessee to pay additional rent to us based on increases in the revenues of the facility over a base year amount 
in addition  most of our medical office building leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes over a base year amount 
these provisions may reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation 
to the extent that 
table of contents some leases do not contain such provisions  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation
