acquisitions consistent with our long term asian manufacturing strategy  in february one of the company s subsidiaries  schweitzer mauduit france sarl  acquired the outstanding stock of pt kimsari paper indonesia kimsari  a specialty paper manufacturer located in medan  sumatra  indonesia 
schweitzer mauduit france paid million for the outstanding shares of kimsari  funded through existing bank lines of credit 
kimsari was formed in and began production of cigarette paper in schweitzer mauduit s french subsidiary  papeteries de mauduit  or pdm  was involved in the design and construction of the kimsari mill in the mid s  has provided intermittent technical support and licensed kimsari to utilize the pdm trademark in the marketing of kimsari s products in indonesia 
since the acquisition  the marketing and sales of products are being coordinated with the efforts of schweitzer mauduit s french operations in the southeast asian market 
in recognition of the affiliation with pdm and the continued use of the pdm trademark  the name of kimsari was changed to pt pdm indonesia 
pt pdm indonesia was accretive to consolidated earnings in its first year as part of our company 
in november  we reached agreement to acquire the tobacco related paper manufacturing assets of a business in the philippines for million  subject to working capital adjustments 
this acquisition is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  after all applicable operating and environmental permits are transferred 
this acquisition  combined with our indonesian operation  will give us the ability to significantly expand market share in the southeast asian market 
china joint venture our discussions with the chinese state tobacco monopoly administration have progressed 
we are optimistic that a joint venture to construct and operate a paper mill to produce tobacco related papers will be approved by the appropriate chinese government agencies in market assessment during  schweitzer mauduit maintained its position as the world s leading supplier of tobacco related papers and expanded its position as the leading independent producer of reconstituted tobacco leaf used in manufacturing blended cigarettes 
worldwide cigarette production continued its long term trend of increasing about percent per year  and worldwide production of ventilated and blended cigarettes continued to grow by estimated annual rates of and percent  respectively 
the ventilated and blended segments continue to be faster growing segments of the worldwide cigarette market 
the increase in demand for these types of cigarettes is a factor in providing growth for the company s tobacco related products 
ventilated and blended cigarettes require the type of higher quality tobacco related papers and reconstituted tobacco leaf made by the company 
cigarette production in both north america and western europe declined by approximately percent in production increased in asia  eastern europe and latin america  areas where our business strategy has us well positioned to participate 
sale of lower ignition propensity cigarettes began in new york state in june  and nationwide sale in canada is possible in the fourth quarter of some news articles refer to these cigarettes as reduced fire risk cigarettes 
our company is supplying cigarette manufacturers with patent protected banded cigarette paper for this application 
growth in sales of lower ignition propensity cigarettes is a positive dynamic for the company 
the addition of new cigarette paper machines by competitors in western europe in and has resulted in excess capacity in that region which may result in a near term decline in cigarette paper sales from our french business unit 
continued weakness of the us dollar versus the euro could support future selling price increases 
financial results the company s sales totaled million  a percent improvement compared to the improvement was the result of increased sales volumes  changes in currency exchange rates  an improved mix of products sold and higher average selling prices 
compared to  total sales volumes increased percent 
sales volumes for the french businesses increased by percent and sales volumes for the brazilian business increased percent while us sales volumes decreased percent 
the indonesian business sales volumes were up percent year over year  although and january sales are not included in our financial results 
operating profit was million  a percent improvement 
operating profit was favorably affected by increased sales volumes and higher average selling prices  partially offset by increased wood pulp  labor  energy  employee benefit and nonmanufacturing expenses 
additionally  pre operating and start up costs totaling million related to rebuilt and new machines were incurred in the united states  brazil and france  as well as million of paris  france office closure expenses 
sarbanes oxley section compliance costs for the year were about million 
these various cost items  in addition to inflationary cost increases and the impact of currency exchange rate changes  caused operating profit return on net sales to decline from percent in to percent in the effective income tax rate was percent compared to percent for minority interest was higher by million due to improved earnings at ltr industries 
net income was million  a percent increase compared to diluted earnings per share were compared to in during   shares of the company s common stock were repurchased at a total cost of million 
our board of directors authorized the further repurchase of shares during the period january  through december  in an amount not to exceed million 
recent developments phillip morris supply agreement on december   we announced that we had reached an agreement with philip morris usa inc to continue our strategic supply agreement for fine papers 
the term of the agreement is from january  to december  the strategic supply agreement continues our ongoing supply of tobacco related papers to philip morris usa inc the two companies have been operating under a strategic supply agreement since january  philippines acquisition on november   we announced that an agreement had been finalized whereby one of our subsidiaries will acquire the tobacco related paper manufacturing assets of kcpi  a philippines company 
the assets to be acquired include land  buildings  production equipment and related utilities and support assets 
the purchase price will be million  subject to working capital adjustments 
this acquisition is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  after all applicable operating and environmental permits are transferred 
kcpi has engaged in the manufacturing of tobacco related paper products for the philippines cigarette industry since and currently has approximately a percent market share of the philippines cigarette paper market 
products include cigarette paper  conventional plug wrap and both base and printed tipping paper 
all of the tobacco related paper sales are currently within the filipino market 
the production equipment being acquired includes paper machines  with annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons  and related converting equipment 
net sales for the tobacco related papers business for the fiscal year ended december  were million 
the business currently employs approximately people 
the acquisition of the tobacco related paper manufacturing assets in the philippines is consistent with our long term strategy for operations in asia 
this purchase will improve our ability to address the needs of our customers in both the philippines and the southeast asian market 
we plan to upgrade the production capabilities of the manufacturing equipment and the quality of the products being produced to better support the demand for tobacco related papers in the region 
lower ignition propensity cigarettes regulations are being developed in canada that would require lower cigarette ignition propensity properties 
the proposed regulations mandate an ignition propensity standard for all cigarettes manufactured or imported into canada on or after october  the final standard and the actual implementation date are still subject to change  although we expect canada to implement the proposed requirements effective in the fourth quarter of credit agreement on january   we entered into amendment no 
to the credit agreement dated as of january   or the amendment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amendment is among schweitzer mauduit international  inc  schweitzer mauduit france sarl  a french corporation  and a group of banks led by soci t g n rale as agent for the banks 
under the amendment  we renewed our day revolving credit facility under the credit agreement  extending these facilities from january  to january  this amendment also increased the amount available to us under the day revolving credit facility in us dollars from million to million and reduced the amount available to us in euros from million to million 
indonesia tsunami although our indonesian operation  which was acquired in february  is located in medan on the island of sumatra  its operations and sales were fortunately not affected by the earthquake and tsunami that struck indonesia in late december 
industry trends consistent with recent historical trends  worldwide cigarette consumption is expected to increase at a rate of approximately one half to one percent per year 
the anticipated decline in the production of cigarettes in developed countries is expected to be more than offset by increased cigarette production in developing countries that currently represent approximately percent of worldwide cigarette production 
age demographics and expected increases in disposable income will support the increased consumption of cigarettes in developing countries 
in addition  the litigation environment is different in most foreign countries compared with the united states  having less of an impact on the pricing of cigarettes  which  in turn  affects cigarette consumption 
cigarette production in the united states is expected to continue to decline as a result of a decline in domestic cigarette consumption caused by increased cigarette prices  health concerns and public perceptions 
as well  cigarette consumption has declined in france and germany following recent tax increases on cigarette sales in those countries 
the cigarette paper market in western europe has recently become more competitive  with pressure on both sales volumes and selling prices  caused by reduced cigarette consumption in several large european markets and new cigarette paper manufacturing capacity that was added in western europe in mid in developing countries  there is a trend toward consumption of more sophisticated cigarettes  which utilize higher quality tobacco related papers  such as those we produce  and reconstituted tobacco leaf 
this trend toward more sophisticated cigarettes reflects increased governmental regulations concerning tar delivery levels and increased competition from multinational cigarette manufacturers 
based on these trends  we expect worldwide demand for our products to continue to increase  with a shift from developed countries to developing countries 
as a result  we are increasing some of our production capacity in developing countries such as brazil  indonesia and the philippines 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies 
following are critical accounting matters  which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and required management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
we discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the estimates and judgments made for each of these items and our accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements 
the accounting for these matters was based on current facts and circumstances which  in our judgment  hold potential for change which could affect our future estimates such that future financial results could differ materially from financial results based on management s current estimates 
our critical accounting policies and estimates arise in conjunction with the following income tax expense and accruals pension benefits expense and accruals litigation contingencies accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we record and maintain income tax valuation allowances as necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount which is estimated more likely than not to be realizable in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have available net operating loss carryforwards  excess foreign tax credit carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other various tax credits in the jurisdictions in which we operate  for which we have recorded deferred tax assets totaling million as of december  certain of these potential future benefits are not expected to be utilized in a manner beneficial to our financial results prior to their expiration 
as a result  as of december   we have million of valuation allowances against certain of the deferred tax assets  as follows dollars in millions total asset valuation allowance net asset net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credit carryforwards federal research  us states and canadian provincial tax credit carryforwards federal amt credit carryforwards under current tax laws governing jurisdictions in which we have net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  remaining nols in france carry forward indefinitely and nols in spain expire years subsequent to the year generated 
we expect sufficient future taxable income in france to fully utilize the french nols  which carry forward indefinitely and for which no valuation allowances have been recorded as of december  the remaining nols at december  in spain will fully expire in if not utilized against taxable income in spain 
valuation allowances related to nols in spain totaled million as of december   fully reserving the related deferred tax asset in spain  since we believe that it is reasonably likely that we will not generate taxable income in spain prior to the expiration of these nols  as sm spain only functions as the primary foreign investment holding company for us 
we receive credits in our us federal income tax return for income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions 
income from foreign sources  including dividend income paid from foreign subsidiaries  is included in taxable income of the us parent 
in some cases  the amount of credits realized in the tax return is more or less than the tax owed on the foreign source income 
when the amount of credits exceeds the amount of taxes owed on that foreign source income  foreign tax credit carryforwards are generated 
when the credits are less than the tax owed  unexpired credit carryforwards from prior years can be utilized in certain circumstances 
these circumstances are dependent upon both foreign source and domestic taxable income 
due to the recent low level of the us business unit s profitability  we have implemented certain income tax elections to accelerate taxable income or to delay deductions in order to maintain positive domestic taxable income eg our election to capitalize research costs in the year incurred for us income tax purposes and amortize over a year life  as opposed to taking the income tax deduction in the year incurred 
however  many such actions cannot be repeated in future years and certain of those elections may make it more difficult to have positive domestic taxable income in future periods 
the profitability of our us business operations must improve to provide us an opportunity to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards in the future in a manner that will be beneficial to our financial results 
however  the american jobs creation act of  enacted during october  increased the carryforward period of foreign tax credits from to years 
based on this extension of the carryforward period  together with the current and forecasted profitability of our us business operations and the requirements of the foreign source income and credit calculations  we currently believe that we will partially utilize the foreign tax credit carryforwards in an earnings beneficial manner prior to their expiration and  therefore  we have partially reserved these deferred tax assets as of december  with million of valuation allowances  reducing the net deferred tax asset to an amount that we estimate we will be able to realize 
we regularly update our estimates of domestic taxable income in order to evaluate whether the facts and circumstances have changed such that we must change our valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets 
likewise  our carryforwards of federal research credits  us state tax credits and canadian provincial tax credits require applicable taxable income in the respective tax returns in order to be utilized prior to their expirations 
we expect that we will be able to fully utilize our federal research credits  which have a year carryforward period  and canadian provincial tax credits prior to their expiration 
however  we do not currently expect sufficient future taxable income in our us state income tax returns to be able to utilize all of our state tax credits prior to their expiration  primarily in new york and new jersey  where the carryforward periods are and years  respectively  and credit utilization is limited to percent of the income tax liability 
as a result  we have million of valuation allowances reducing our deferred tax assets to amounts that we estimate we will be able to realize 
we regularly update these estimates in order to evaluate whether the facts and circumstances have changed such that we must change our valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets 
under current us tax law  federal alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards have no expiration 
we believe that profitability will improve in our us operations in future years 
since the federal amt credit carryforwards have no expiration  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the full benefit of these credits in future years  and thus we do not believe any valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets is appropriate as of december  in summary  of our valuation allowances at december   million relates to nols in spain  million relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards for purposes of us federal income taxes and million relates to us state credits 
we do not expect to generate taxable income in spain prior to expiration of nols in that jurisdiction 
the million related to foreign tax credits and the million related to state tax credits are dependent upon taxable income in the united states 
we do anticipate increased profitability in the united states in the future  but not in sufficient enough amounts to fully realize these deferred tax assets in a beneficial manner prior to the expiration of the underlying credits 
it is possible that our estimates of future profitability in the united states could change from our current estimates based on business results or actions taken by us which effect taxable income 
while we do not currently believe it is likely that a material change will occur  it is possible that changes in these factors  changes in the level of foreign source income or a change in the likelihood of foreign tax credit utilization in an earnings beneficial manner  could result in an adjustment of our valuation allowances in future periods 
due to the number of uncertain factors and the complexities of the calculations  it is not possible to reasonably estimate what future impact could occur 
while we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of estimated net deferred income tax benefits  it is possible that the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and judgments are based could change  which could result in additional income tax expense in the future to increase the associated valuation allowances 
however  we continue to evaluate possible methods to favorably utilize those assets that are reserved and  therefore  it is also possible that changes in the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and judgments are based could benefit us in the future by some of the million of deferred tax assets reserved as of december  for additional information regarding income taxes and valuation allowances  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension accounting we recognize the estimated compensation cost of employees pension benefits over their approximate period of service to us in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
our earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to pension benefits  which primarily consist of us and french pension benefits 
each year s recorded expense is an estimate based on actuarial calculations of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations for our various plans 
the calculations of pension benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts  including the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the projected rate of future compensation increases 
we evaluate these assumptions at least once each year  or as facts and circumstances dictate  and make changes as conditions warrant 
we determine these actuarial assumptions  after consultation with our actuaries  on december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year 
changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported income  which will result in changes to the recorded benefit plan assets and liabilities 
we believe that our selections for these key actuarial assumptions are reasonable estimates for our plans and experience 
our us employee pension plans accounted for approximately percent of our total pension plan assets and total accumulated benefit obligations  as of december  the table below shows the assumptions that we used and will use to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the discount rates used for our determination of projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations for our us employee pension plans fluctuate from year to year based on current market interest rates for high quality fixed income investments 
we also evaluate the expected average duration of our pension obligations in determining our discount rate 
the discount rate assumption is determined based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds moody s aa corporate bonds with maturities that are consistent with projected future plan cash flows 
a change in the discount rate assumption of percent would change our estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by evaluating historical and projected returns for benchmark equity and fixed income market indices as well as the projected investment mix of our pension assets 
actual rates of return loss earned on us pension plan assets  net of expense  for each of the last years  the period of time we have managed our pension assets were year return year return we changed our target us pension asset investment mix during and increased our expected return on plan assets to percent for we utilized a monte carlo simulation analysis on the target us pension asset investment mix to determine our expected return on plan assets for both and for  we will maintain the expected rate of return on plan assets at percent  the same as for the current asset allocation policy of our us employee pension plan targets an allocation of percent in equity securities  percent in fixed income securities and percent in other investments 
a change in the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of percent would change the estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
the rate of annual compensation increase is directly related to negotiated union contracts for our us hourly employees and wage adjustment guidelines for our us salary employees 
despite our belief that the estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results will likely differ from our estimates  and these differences could materially affect the future financial statements either favorably or unfavorably 
additionally  it is possible that assets of our plans could decline as a result of negative investment returns  which combined with increasing amounts of accumulated benefit obligations  could result in us being required to make significant cash contributions to the plans in future periods 
for additional information regarding pension plan assets  benefit obligations and accounting assumptions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation contingencies we evaluate contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  when a material loss contingency exists  we accrue an estimated loss when the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if no accrual is made for a material loss contingency because both of the above conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists materially in excess of an accrual that is made  disclosure regarding the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 
as described in detail under litigation in part i  item  legal proceedings  swm b received assessments from the taxing authorities of the state of rio de janeiro  brazil related to icms taxes  or the assessment 
as of december   the assessment totaled approximately million  of which approximately million is covered by an indemnification agreement with the former owner of the predecessor of swm b  for a net exposure of approximately million 
in  the courts granted swm b relief from having to bond the potential tax liability while we challenge the assessment 
in august and november  the court hearing the challenges in the state of rio de janeiro ruled in swm b s favor in its suits to vacate the assessment  affirming the bases of swm b s legal challenges of the assessment 
while the favorable decisions by the court with respect to the assessment provide further support for swm b s positions  these decisions were automatically appealed  as provided for under brazilian legislation for cases involving an adverse financial outcome for the government in lower courts 
in june  the st civil chamber of the court of appeals of the state of rio de janeiro granted the appeal of the lower court s decision annulling of the assessments against swm b 
the appellate court reached its decision based on a majority vote of the judge panel  with judge issuing a written dissenting opinion 
in june  swm b filed a motion and supporting brief with the appellate court for a rehearing en banc 
in august  the th civil chamber of the court of appeals of the state of rio de janeiro denied the state of rio de janeiro s appeal of the lower court s decision annulling the other assessment against swm b 
the state of rio de janeiro automatically appealed this favorable decision 
swm b continues to vigorously contest the assessment and believes the final resolution of this matter may entail judicial proceedings up to and including presentation of the matter to the supreme court of brazil and is not likely to be finally resolved for several years 
our current evaluation of the matter is that swm b is more likely than not to prevail in its challenge of the assessment under the facts and law as presently understood and no reserve has been provided for this contingent liability 
however  there is a reasonable possibility that swm b will ultimately be required to pay all or a portion of this contingent liability  which could adversely impact our future financial results or financial condition 
in february  swm b filed suit against the state of rio de janeiro to recover icms credits previously reversed in following receipt of the assessment 
after the assessment was filed against us  swm b changed its procedures and did not utilize icms tax credits through the end of production and sale of immune papers during as a result of the favorable developments during mentioned above with respect to the assessment  swm b petitioned the court for permission to offset approximately million of overpaid icms taxes against current tax liabilities 
during march  the court rejected swm b s claim  which decision swm b has appealed 
although swm b believes it has a reasonable chance of success in this case  no asset has been recorded for this potential recovery 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  this statement requires companies to calculate the fair value of stock options granted to employees  and amortize that amount over the option s vesting period as an expense through the income statement 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts for fiscal through fiscal  where we used a fair value based method under sfas to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect to begin expensing stock options in the third quarter of  which is expected to increase non cash operating expenses by approximately million  using similar assumptions and methodology as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act  or ajca  introduced a special percent tax deduction on qualified production activities 
fas clarified that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate change 
we do not expect the adoption of this new tax provision to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  or fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of the ajca introduced a limited time percent dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  or repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
although fas is effective immediately  we do not expect to be able to complete our evaluation of the repatriation provision until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
in january  the treasury department began to issue the first of a series of clarifying guidance documents related to this provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision during the second quarter of the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between and million 
while we estimate that the related potential range of additional income tax is between and million  this estimate is subject to change following technical correction legislation that we believe is forthcoming from congress

an increase of million  or percent  relating to increased sales volumes resulting from internal sales growth 
sales volumes increased by percent  excluding sales of the acquired indonesian operation 
sales volumes of the french segment  excluding indonesia  increased percent  primarily as a result of increased rtl sales associated with the new rtl production line that began operation during the fourth quarter of brazil experienced increased sales volumes of percent  attributable to increased sales of tobacco related papers 
sales volumes in the united states declined by percent due to lower north american market demand and changes in the product mix produced in the us mills 
higher average selling prices and improved product mix contributed million  or percent 
new products developed for the united states  including papers for lower ignition propensity cigarettes  allowed for sales growth due to product mix and pricing 
higher average selling prices were in part related to recovery of inflationary cost increases 
acquisition of the indonesian operation in february contributed million  or percent 
sales of tobacco related products accounted for percent of net sales for the year ended december   consistent with the prior year 
french segment net sales increased million  or percent  from to the increase in sales volumes  in large part due to increased capacity in the spay  france mill of ltr industries  provided the majority of this increase 
this project provided for a third rtl production line and supporting equipment with annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons  which increased the total annual production capacity at the spay mill to approximately  metric tons 
additional increased net sales resulted from favorable currency exchange rates  a direct result of a stronger euro versus the us dollar  and improved average selling prices 
the us segment realized increased net sales of million  or percent  compared with net sales of the us segment increased as a result of increased selling prices  due to a partial recovery of inflationary cost increases  and a more favorable mix of products

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefits 
after being in a net overfunded position in and prior years  our us and french pension plans changed to an underfunded status in as a result of the poor performance of the equities markets and lower interest rates that caused estimated future pension liabilities to increase because of the necessity to use a lower discount rate

for more information regarding our retiree healthcare and life insurance benefit obligations  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook consistent with recent historical trends  worldwide cigarette consumption is expected to increase at a rate of approximately one half to one percent per year 
the anticipated decline in the production of cigarettes in developed countries is expected to be more than offset by increased cigarette production in developing countries that currently represent approximately percent of worldwide cigarette production 
age demographics and expected increases in disposable income are expected to support the increased consumption of cigarettes in developing countries 
in addition  the litigation environment is different in most foreign countries compared with the united states  having less of an impact on the pricing of cigarettes  which  in turn  affects cigarette consumption 
cigarette production in the united states is expected to continue to decline as a result of a decline in domestic cigarette consumption caused by increased cigarette prices  health concerns and public perceptions 
as well  cigarette consumption has declined in france and germany following recent tax increases on cigarette sales in those countries 
we are experiencing weakness in our tobacco related paper sales in western europe caused by reduced cigarette consumption in several large european markets and new cigarette paper manufacturing capacity that was added in western europe in mid this is expected to result in increased cigarette paper machine downtime in france in in developing countries  there is a trend toward consumption of more sophisticated cigarettes  which utilize higher quality tobacco related papers  such as those we produce  and reconstituted tobacco leaf 
this trend toward more sophisticated cigarettes reflects increased governmental regulations concerning tar delivery levels and increased competition from multinational cigarette manufacturers 
based on these trends  we expect worldwide demand for our products to continue to increase  with a shift from developed countries to developing countries 
as a result  we are increasing some of our production capacity in developing countries such as brazil  indonesia and the philippines 
the new rtl production line added at our spay  france mill  which started up in the fourth quarter of  is expected to continue to contribute positively to sales volumes and operating profit in sales of cigarette papers for lower ignition propensity cigarettes  of which we had limited production and sales during  are expected to continue during increased sales of these products are expected in mid in support of the anticipated requirement for lower ignition propensity properties for all cigarettes manufactured or imported into canada on or after october  these papers sell for a higher price than the conventional cigarette papers they replace and are expected to have a positive impact on our financial results 
we continue to work with our customers in their development of lower ignition propensity cigarettes in anticipation of the pending canadian regulations and to also improve the performance of cigarette papers for lower ignition propensity cigarettes that are already being sold 
as additional experience is gained  cost improvements are being achieved in the production of these products 
a new cigarette paper machine began operation at our mill in brazil in january  which will support our cigarette paper manufacturing strategy announced in april increased cigarette paper volumes in brazil and improved manufacturing operations in the united states are expected to benefit our financial results in however  start up costs related to the upgraded paper machines in both the united states and brazil are expected to continue into  and could total approximately million during the first quarter 
we expect to face other cost pressures during the per ton cost of wood pulp is expected to be above the level  unfavorably impacting cost of products sold 
purchased energy costs are also expected to be unfavorable  given the current cost of oil 
increases have also been experienced in our employee benefit costs and labor rates which will continue in we typically experience a lag in our ability to offset such cost increases in our product pricing 
we also expect to begin expensing stock options in the third quarter of  which is expected to increase our non cash operating expenses by approximately million  using similar assumptions and methodology as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately to percent in we currently expect our capital spending for and to total approximately million in each year 
during november  we announced that an agreement has been finalized whereby one of our subsidiaries will acquire the tobacco related paper manufacturing assets of a company in the philippines for a purchase price of million  subject to working capital adjustments 
the transaction is subject to various governmental permitting and authorizations and is expected to close in the second quarter of this acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results in factors that may affect future results many factors outside of our control could impact future financial results 
while not an exhaustive list  the following important factors could cause our actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements we have made  or that have been made on our behalf 
international business risks in addition to our us operations  we have manufacturing facilities in france  brazil  indonesia and canada 
principally through our french  brazilian and indonesian subsidiaries  we market and sell products in over countries  many of which are third world markets which are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political and economic conditions  expropriation  import and export tariffs  regulatory controls and restrictions  monetary exchange controls  inflationary economies  changes in currency value  changes in business and income tax regulations and risks related to restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
tax and repatriation matters we are subject to various business and income tax laws in each of the countries in which we do business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
although we believe we comply with the many business and income tax requirements of each of our operations  we are exposed to the possibility of changes in enacted laws and interpretations of laws which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
also  we evaluate our overall financing plans in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and manage international movements of cash from and amongst our foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner  however  an unanticipated international movement of funds due to unexpected changes in our business or in needs of the business could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
market risk as a multinational entity  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we utilize a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including operating and financing activities and  where considered appropriate  utilizing derivative instruments 
we use derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and not for trading or speculation 
all derivative instruments we use are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties 
foreign currency risk we have subsidiaries located in france  brazil  indonesia  canada  hong kong  the philippines and spain 
together with our subsidiaries  we conduct business in over countries worldwide transacting much of our business in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on our operating profit 
since we transact business in many other countries  some of those sale and purchase transactions are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of our operations 
as a result  changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the transaction is denominated versus the local currency of our operation into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction 
this can result in more or less local currency revenue or cost related to such transaction  and thus have an effect on our operating profit 
this currency transaction risk is mitigated  in part  since some of the revenue and expense transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars  providing a degree of natural hedging 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the amount reported in other income expense  net 
once the above indicated receivables and payables from the sale and purchase transactions have been recorded  to the extent currency exchange rates change prior to settlement of the balance  a gain or loss on the non local currency denominated asset or liability balance may be experienced  in which case such gain or loss is included in other income expense  net 
we utilize forward and swap contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk when it is practical and economical to do so 
the use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instrument will offset  in whole or in part  the loss or gain on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
these instruments are entered into with well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually these contracts extend for no more than months 
we believe that the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during  and we do not expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies we use to manage such exposures in the near future 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of our functional currencies and those of our subsidiaries against the prevailing market rates of non local currencies involving our transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre tax loss of approximately million 
these hypothetical gains or losses on foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are defined as the difference between the contract rates and the hypothetical exchange rates 
while we believe the above loss resulting from the hypothetical unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be material to our results of operations  we reduce this risk by selectively hedging our exposure when it is practical and economical to do so 
in addition to currency transaction risks  we are also exposed to currency translation risk 
since the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are determined in the local currency of each foreign subsidiary  these financial results are translated into us dollars on a monthly basis in order to determine our consolidated financial results 
a weakening of the us dollar versus the local currency of the foreign subsidiary will have a favorable currency translation impact when positive financial results of that foreign subsidiary are translated to us dollars 
our foreign currency translation effects typically offset to a significant degree the foreign currency transaction impacts in our operating results 
interest rate risk we hold a combination of variable and fixed rate debt consisting of short and long term instruments 
we selectively hedge our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable rate long term debt when it is practical and economical to do so 
we utilize various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
most often we utilize variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements  typically with contractual terms no longer than months 
our strategy to manage exposure to interest rate changes did not change during  and we do not expect any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate changes or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 
various outstanding interest bearing instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in fair market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to our fixed rate debt outstanding at december   a percent change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair market value of such debt and with respect to our variable rate debt outstanding at december   a percent change in interest rates would not result in a material impact to our future annual pre tax earnings 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risks  the most significant of which relates to the price of wood pulp  which is our largest single component of cost 
the per ton cost of wood pulp is cyclical in nature and more volatile than general inflation 
we consumed   and  metric tons of wood pulp in  and  respectively 
during the period from january through december  the us list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  a representative pulp grade that we use  ranged from a low of per metric ton in march and april of to a high of per metric ton in june through august we normally maintain approximately to days of inventories to support our operations 
as a result  there is a lag in the impact of changes in the per ton list price of wood pulp on our cost of products sold 
selling prices of our paper products are influenced  in part  by the market price for wood pulp  which is determined by worldwide industry supply and demand 
generally  over time  we have been able to increase our selling prices in response to increased per ton wood pulp costs and have generally reduced our selling prices when wood pulp costs have significantly declined 
increases in prices of wood pulp could adversely impact our earnings if selling prices are not increased or if such increases do not fully compensate for or trail the increases in wood pulp prices 
we have not utilized derivative instruments to manage this risk 
with respect to our commodity price risk  a hypothetical percent change in per ton wood pulp prices would impact our future annual pre tax earnings by approximately million  assuming no compensating change in our selling prices 
we believe that  while our exposure to commodity price risk is material to our results of operations  our customers understand such risk and over time changes in the price of wood pulp are typically reflected in selling prices 
general inflation due to competitive pressures  we are not always able to pass along our cost increases through increased selling prices 
our main costs impacted by general inflation are wages and salaries  energy  chemicals  employee benefit costs  primarily medical and pension expenses  and costs of insurance 
seasonality sales of our products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the united states and brazil 
in the united states  customer shutdowns typically occur in july and december and typically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
in brazil  customer orders are typically lower in december due to a holiday season during much of january and february 
environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air  water and other emissions from our mills as well as the disposal of solid waste generated by our operations 
we believe we are operating in compliance with  or are taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while we have incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  such costs are not expected to materially affect our business or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that a material adverse effect on our financial statements will not occur at some future time as a result of environmental matters 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings environmental matters 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings 
in addition  we are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against us  management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of our customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in more than countries around the world 
two such customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities around the world  particularly in the united states  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the possible harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products  to limit smoking in public places and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in the fourth quarter of  the major us cigarette manufacturers reached agreement with all us states and several commonwealths and territories to settle health care cost recovery and other claims 
in anticipation of these settlements and as a direct result of these settlements  most of the us cigarette manufacturers increased prices of cigarettes significantly 
domestic cigarette consumption has declined  in part due to these price increases  which  in turn  decreases demand for our products 
during  the us department of justice filed a multi billion dollar civil suit against the tobacco industry 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms and for alleged violations of antitrust laws 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry  our financial liquidity or relationships with our suppliers 
also in recent years  certain governmental entities  particularly in north america  have considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked 
the state of new york enacted such a law and as of june  requires that all cigarettes sold in the state of new york have lower ignition propensity properties 
in addition to the state of new york  several other states have introduced bills in their respective legislative committees concerning cigarette fire safety standards 
also  canada is in the process of enacting legislation that would require lower cigarette ignition propensity properties for all cigarettes manufactured or imported into canada on or after october  there appears to be momentum building for lower ignition propensity products  and we currently anticipate that cigarette manufacturers are likely to use our banded and print banded cigarette papers to meet these regulatory requirements  however there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the timing and volume requirements our customers would have for such papers 
furthermore  it is not possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect the consumer tobacco products industry in general 
during  percent of our net sales were from products used by the tobacco industry in the making and packaging of cigarettes or other tobacco products 
we are unable to predict the effects that the above described legal and governmental actions might have on our results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  particularly in the foregoing discussion regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates  outlook and factors that may affect future results  constitute forward looking statements  generally identified by  but not limited to  phrases such as we expect or we anticipate  as well as by use of words of similar effect  such as appears  could  should  may and typically  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to the safe harbor created by that act 
this report contains many such forward looking statements  including statements regarding management s expectations of future selling prices for our products  our anticipated market shares  future market prices for wood pulp used by us  expected sales volumes trends  new product introductions  paper machine start up expenses  paper machine operating schedules and downtime  expected outcome of labor negotiations  anticipated energy  pension  compensation  employee benefit  insurance  depreciation  nonmanufacturing and interest costs  currency exchange rates  anticipated financial and operational results  anticipated capital spending  anticipated tax and other governmental actions  effective income tax rates  contingencies  anticipated common stock share repurchases  stockholder dividends  stock option accounting and other expected transactions 
forward looking statements are made based upon our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting our business 
there can be no assurances that such events will occur or that our results will be as estimated 
many factors outside our control also could impact the realization of such estimates 
the above mentioned important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements we have made  or that have been made on our behalf
