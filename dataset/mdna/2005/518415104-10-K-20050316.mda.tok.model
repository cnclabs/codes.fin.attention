item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lattice semiconductor corporation designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and thus enable shorter design cycle times and reduced development costs 
within this market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices plds and field programmable gate arrays fpgas each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  consumer  automotive  medical and military markets 
overview of revenue for our business in increased to approximately million as compared to approximately million in due to growth of our new products partially offset by a decline in revenues from mature products 
there was a decline in business conditions beginning in the third quarter of which has continued into the first quarter of attributable to general weakening in the communications end market 
among other things  future revenue growth is dependent on overall economic conditions for our industry and market acceptance of our new fpga products 
our gross margin in and was for the year 
lower production yields and average selling prices on our new products held margins down below the level achieved in research and development expenses increased to approximately million of revenue in compared to approximately million of revenue in research and development spending is predominantly related to the continued development of next generation fpga products 
we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million of revenue in as compared to approximately million of revenue in and increased primarily due to sales commissions and marketing expenses related to new products and increased professional fees primarily related to compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of to the extent our revenues continue to grow  we expect that there will be a less than proportionate increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
amortization of intangible assets of approximately million in will decline to approximately million in as amortization of intangible assets acquired in the vantis acquisition was completed in the june quarter 
interest and other income expense of approximately million in includes approximately million of interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents  and approximately million of gains from the sale of umc common stock and extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  partially offset by amortization of issuance costs of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  to the extent market conditions allow  we may make similar extinguishments of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  and sales of umc shares in future quarters 
we are not currently paying federal or state income taxes and do not expect to pay or accrue such taxes in we expect to continue to pay foreign income taxes at current levels

on august   we completed the stock for stock acquisition of cerdelinx technologies  inc cerdelinx for million shares of our common stock valued at per share 
this transaction was accounted for as an asset purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations for cerdelinx and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning august  in estimating the fair value of the assets acquired  management considered various factors  including an appraisal 
in process research and development ipr d costs were appraised at million and charged to operations on the acquisition date 
remaining intangible asset costs are being amortized to operations over a period averaging five years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the field programmable gate array fpga business agere fpga of agere systems inc agere for million in cash 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations for agere fpga and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning january  in estimating the fair value of the assets acquired  management considered various factors  including an appraisal 
ipr d costs were appraised at million and charged to operations on the acquisition date 
remaining intangible asset costs are being amortized to operations over years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
revenue was million in  an increase of from revenue was million in  a decrease of from revenue of million 
the composition of our revenue by product family for the years presented was as follows years ended december  fpga pld prior to the acquisition of agere fpga  we had no revenue from fpga products 
the increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily due to growth of our product sales in asia attributable to stronger business conditions offset in part by a decline in business conditions beginning in the third quarter of attributable to general weakening in the communications end market 
during  our revenue was adversely affected by the business downturn experienced by the semiconductor and programmable logic markets that began in  offset in part by a general business recovery experienced late in revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was approximately for  for  and for we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue 
our sales by geographic region were as follows in thousands years ended december  united states export sales europe asia pacific other than japan and china japan china other total revenue from export sales total revenue during  total units sold increased by while overall average selling prices declined by when compared to the increase in units sold is attributable to sales of new products while the decrease in average selling prices is attributable to lower selling prices of mature products 
average selling prices of mainstream products increased by in compared to while units sold were flat 
from a product line viewpoint  in there was a increase in fpga units sold  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices when compared to for pld products in  units sold increased while average selling prices decreased by when compared to during  total units sold and our overall average selling prices both decreased by approximately nine percent when compared to in  both units sold and average selling price were adversely impacted by the business downturn in the semiconductor and programmable logic markets that began in our ability to maintain or increase the level of our average selling price is dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of new products 
see factors affecting future results 
gross margin 
our gross margin percentage was for and  and for similar margins in compared to reflect the growth of sales of new products  that currently carry lower margins  offset by higher margins in mature products that declined in revenue in the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily attributable to a provision for an allowance for price protection and sales returns for distributors in the september quarter 
to a lesser extent  this decrease in gross margin also reflects the increased proportion of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of lower revenue levels in research and development 
research and development expense was million for compared to million for and million in research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  masks  prototype wafers  third party design automation software  assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the increases in and when compared to the prior year were primarily due to the continued development of new products  including especially engineering mask costs 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies such as nm  nm and beyond  mask costs are becoming increasingly more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in  million in  and million in the increase compared to was primarily due to the increase in sales commissions and marketing expenses related to new products and increased professional and legal fees related to initial compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in when compared to was primarily due to increased marketing expense related to new products and increased professional fees including those related to the restatement of the first  second and third quarter financial statements 
in process research and development 
ipr d consisted of those products obtained through acquisition that were not yet proven to be technologically feasible but had been developed to a point where there was value associated with them in relation to potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing date of the acquisitions 
ipr d recorded in resulted from the completion of the agere fpga and cerdelinx acquisitions described below cerdelinx the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquired ipr d from the cerdelinx acquisition recognized in the third quarter of was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there were no alternative future uses 
the acquired ipr d consisted of low power cmos transceivers and backplane interfaces with embedded high speed serdes i o 
these projects were approximately complete and were estimated to be completed in at an estimated cost of approximately million 
during  new products based on this technology were completed 
in addition  this technology along with subsequently developed technology is being integrated into other new products expected to be completed in there has been no material change in the estimated cost of these projects 
the fair value was determined by an income approach where fair value is the present value of projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over six year periods were discounted at rates ranging from to in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
the net cash flows for such projects were based on management s estimates of revenue  expenses and asset requirements 
the remaining portion of these projects has completion risk related to silicon functionality  architecture performance  packaging technology  continued availability of key technical personnel and product reliability 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitive product introduction is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
agere fpga the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquired ipr d in the agere fpga acquisition was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there was no alternative future use 
projects in the ipr d category were the orca fpga family  the next generation fpga family and the fpsc field programmable system chips 
the following is a brief description of these projects 
the orca fpga family project  increasing speed and density and enhancing yields  was approximately complete and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
this project was completed during with no material change in cost 
the next generation fpga family project  increasing speed and density while reducing die size  was approximately complete and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
this project was significantly redefined and is now expected to be completed during the future development of fpsc field programmable system chips was approximately to complete  and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
this project was completed during with no material change in cost 
the ipr d value of million was determined by an income approach where fair value is the present value of projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over year periods were discounted at rates ranging from to in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
the net cash flows for such projects were based on management s estimates of revenue  expenses and asset requirements 
any delays or failures in the completion of these projects could impact our expected return on investment and future results 
in addition  our financial condition would be adversely affected if the value of other intangible assets acquired became impaired 
the remaining project has completion risks related to silicon functionality  architecture performance  packaging technology  continued availability of key technical personnel and product reliability 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitors product introductions is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisitions  discussed above  our vantis acquisition and our acquisition of integrated intellectual property  inc ip 
amortization expense was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in amortization expense in was attributable to intangible assets from the vantis acquisition which were fully amortized during the increase in amortization for when compared with was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions  and approximately million incremental amortization of deferred stock compensation in association with the accelerated write off of accrued deferred compensation recorded in conjunction with certain assumed in the money stock options as part of a stock option exchange program completed during the first quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in when compared to is attributable to higher balances and interest rates 
the decrease in when compared to was due to lower interest rates on invested balances 
interest expense 
interest expense was insignificant in  million in  and million in substantially all interest expense resulted from the debt issued to partially fund our vantis acquisition 
the decrease in when compared to and in when compared to was due to the extinguishment of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in july see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income  net 
other income  net  was million in  million in  and million in for  other income  net  consists of a million gain on sale of umc shares and a million gain on extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due net of million amortization of convertible note issuance costs and other costs 
for  other income  net  consists of million of gain recorded on the partial extinguishment of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due  substantially offset by the million call premium associated with the extinguishment of our convertible subordinated notes see note to our consolidated financial statements 
for  the amount recorded consists primarily of a million gain in conjunction with the extinguishment of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes see note to our consolidated financial statements  and a million gain in conjunction with the sale of a portion of our umc shares see note to our consolidated financial statements 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the tax provision is related to income taxes on our foreign subsidiaries primarily engaged in selling and research and development activities 
the tax benefit in is primarily a result of releasing million of tax reserves as the related statute of limitations expired and a million refund of federal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for of million is primarily the result of a million charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of  representing a full valuation allowance for our recorded deferred tax assets see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  such as accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities  income taxes and deferred income  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor and related revenue and costs are then reflected in income 
our method of revenue recognition for deferred distributor sales is based on certain assumptions including our average collection experience compared to resale reported by the distributors 
to the extent actual results differ from these assumptions  revenue will change accordingly 
deferred income 
in determining the balance in the deferred income account  we make estimates of salable and returnable inventory at certain distributors and we make estimates similar to those used to value inventory on hand to value inventory at these distributors 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  the balances of reported deferred income  revenue and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including future price declines and forecasted demand for our products 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  the balances of reported inventory and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
long lived assets 
we account for our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets are generally being amortized over five years  and fifteen years for income tax purposes  on a straight line basis 
accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
as of december   and  we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
in determining the value of income tax liabilities  we make estimates of the results of future examinations of our income tax returns by taxing authorities 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our income tax provision will be affected accordingly 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and marketable securities  which was approximately million greater than the balance of million at december  working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to payments to fujitsu pursuant to the advance payment agreement entered into in september during we generated approximately million of cash and cash equivalents from our operations  net of a million payment to fujitsu limited discussed below  compared with million during  of which approximately million was attributable to income tax refunds 
accounts receivable declined million at december  compared to december  due to lower billings in the later portion of the fourth quarter of as compared to the similar period in combined with lower revenues in the december quarter compared to the december quarter 
inventories decreased approximately million  or  at december  compared to december  and decreased by million  or  at december  as compared to the balance at the end of the prior year primarily due to reduced starts and receipts of wafers in response to changing revenue levels 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by approximately million in december  as compared to december  primarily due to increased amounts of prepaid wafers expected to be used in the next twelve months see note to our consolidated financial statements  increases in prepaid software licenses  maintenance contracts and insurance  and additional income tax refunds receivable 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by approximately million  or  at december  as compared to december  primarily due to a decrease in refundable income taxes  offsetting an approximate million increase in the amount of prepaid wafers expected to be used in the next twelve months see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the current portion of equity securities available for sale decreased from million to million at december  as compared to december  these securities represent the portion of our investment in umc that are available for sale during see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the current portion of equity securities available for sale increased by million  or  at december  as compared to december  property and equipment  less accumulated depreciation  decreased by million at december  as compared to december  and decreased by million in as compared to the balance in the prior year due to lower expenditures for capital equipment 
net intangible assets decreased by million and million in and as compared to the balance of the prior year  respectively  which is attributable to amortization of these assets 
capital expenditures were approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended december  foundry investments  advances and other assets increased by approximately million at december  compared to december  due to a million recorded advance for wafer supply to fujitsu see note to our consolidated financial statements partially offset by a decline in our umc investment due to million of shares sold and a million market price decline 
foundry investments  advances and other assets decreased by approximately million  or  at december  as compared to the balance of the prior year 
this was primarily due to the million of our umc investment reclassified to equity securities available for sale and the million reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets related to prepaid wafers  partially offset by a million gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to changes in the market value of our umc shares 
as of december   we owned million shares of umc common stock of which million shares were restricted from sale for more than one year by the terms of our agreement with umc 
during  we sold approximately million shares of umc common stock for approximately million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 
during  we sold million of our umc shares for approximately million in cash  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
in the future  we may choose to liquidate additional umc shares 
in we entered into an advance payment production agreement with seiko epson and epson electronics america  inc eea  which was subsequently amended in and march under this agreement we advanced million to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility 
the advance is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
no interest income is recorded 
the agreement calls for wafers to be supplied by seiko epson through eea pursuant to purchase agreements with eea 
cumulatively  million of these payments have been repaid to us in the form of semiconductor wafers 
we currently estimate that approximately million of the outstanding advances are expected to be repaid with semiconductor wafers during the next twelve months and are thus reflected as part of other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are not obligated to make additional payments under this agreement 
on june   we issued million in zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  no interest will accrue or be payable related to these notes 
holders of these notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time before the close of business on the date of their maturity  unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased  if the price of our common stock issuable upon conversion of a note reaches a specified threshold  the notes are called for redemption  if we request a redemption  or make a distribution to common stockholders that is dilutive to note holders or if we become a party to a merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets or the trading price of the notes falls below certain thresholds 
the conversion price is approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
on or after july   we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously repurchased or converted at of the principal amount of the notes 
on july   holders have the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes in cash at of the principal amount of the notes 
holders also have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes at of the principal amount of the notes 
generally  a fundamental change is an occurrence resulting in substantially all of our common stock being converted into common stock which is not listed on a united states stock exchange or nasdaq 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness  and are structurally subordinated as to the revenues and assets of our subsidiaries to all debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no senior indebtedness and our subsidiaries had approximately million of debt and other liabilities outstanding 
issuance costs relative to these convertible notes are included in foundry investments  advances and other assets and aggregated approximately million and are being amortized to expense over the lives of the notes 
accumulated amortization of these issuance costs was approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
in october  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  during  we extinguished approximately million of these notes for approximately million in cash and recognized a net gain of approximately million after writing off approximately million of unamortized issuance costs 
during  we extinguished approximately million of these notes for approximately million in cash and recognized a net gain of approximately million 
in connection with this transaction  we also wrote off approximately million of unamortized issuance costs 
in the first quarter through march  we extinguished million of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  for million resulting in a gain of million which will be included in interest and other income expense for the march  quarter 
in the future we may choose to extinguish additional zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  the estimated fair value of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july   based on quoted market prices  was approximately million at december  on july   we extinguished for cash all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in  originally issued in october  plus accrued interest 
total cash paid at extinguishment approximated million  including par value of million  accrued interest of approximately million and a call premium of of the outstanding notes  or approximately million 
this call premium  plus unamortized issuance costs of approximately million as of the extinguishment date  was recorded as other expense in the quarter ended september  during  we extinguished approximately million face value of our convertible subordinated notes due in for approximately million in cash  including accrued interest 
we recognized a net gain of approximately million in connection with these transactions 
on september   we entered into an advance payment and purchase agreement the fujitsu agreement with fujitsu limited fujitsu  pursuant to which we will advance million to fujitsu in support of the development and construction of a new mm wafer fabrication facility in mie  japan 
the initial two payments of million each were made in october and january  with the remaining payments to be made in two stages upon the achievement of certain milestones 
we currently anticipate that the advance payment will be paid in full by the second quarter of our million advance will be credited against the purchase price of mm wafers from the new wafer fabrication facility 
the fujitsu agreement will continue until the full amount of the advance payment has been returned to us in the form of wafers or other repayment  subject to the right of either party to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events 
we may request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we have not used all of our wafer credits by december  the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured 
the foregoing summary description of the fujitsu agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the fujitsu agreement  which is filed as an exhibit to our form q for the quarter ended september  the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december  in thousands fiscal year operating leases inventory and related purchase obligations advance payment and purchase agreement zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  later years certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through rental expense under the operating leases was approximately million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers 
other subcontractors provide substantially all of our assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services well in advance  and we are obligated to pay for these materials and services once they are completed 
we expect to receive the material and pay the purchase obligation within four to six months subsequent to december  represents obligations to make payments upon completion of milestones presently estimated to occur by the second quarter of included in the above operating lease amounts are certain properties which are currently subleased 
a portion of this sublease income is payable to the property owner 
future minimum sublease receipts  based on agreements in place at december   net of such payments are as follows in thousands fiscal year amount in december  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to five million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
there were no repurchases of common stock in  or congress adopted the american jobs creation act of which among other things provides companies with foreign subsidiaries the opportunity to repatriate earnings of such subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate 
presently we have substantial tax loss carryforwards which could be used to offset tax liabilities arising from repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings 
we are not planning to repatriate earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and expected cash generated from operations combined with our ability to borrow additional funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including joint ventures  equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf the consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached in the march meeting is to be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  in november  the fasb staff indicated that the fasb will delay until the fasb staff position on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
management will evaluate the affect of adopting the recognition and measurement guidance when the matter is finalized 
in december  the fasb issued a statement share based payment a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the company and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the effective date of the standard is for interim or fiscal periods beginning after june  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations  as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
at this time we have not made an estimate of the impact of this statement on our future financial results 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements which provides historical information that may be useful in assessing the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
factors affecting future results we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling new products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
our future success depends on our ability to introduce new or improved silicon and software products that meet customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
we are presently in the process of releasing next generation fpga product families that are critical to our ability to address the fpga segment of the programmable logic market 
if we fail to introduce these  or other  new products in a timely manner or such products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
fujitsu limited has agreed to manufacture our next generation fpga products on its nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on a nanometer technology with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
the success of our next generation fpga products is dependent on our ability to successfully partner with fujitsu  which has not previously manufactured any of our products 
if for any reason we are unsuccessful in our efforts to partner with fujitsu in connection with these next generation fpga products  our future revenue growth would be materially adversely affected 
the introduction of new silicon and software products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the market reception of new products depends on accurate projections of long term customer demand  which by their nature are uncertain 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software product families and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  product cost  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies or alternative fabrication facilities 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use larger wafer sizes and smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundries 
because we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at the fabs of seiko epson  umc  chartered semiconductor  fujitsu or future foundries may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue levels and operating results during industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less technology driven industries 
our financial performance has periodically been negatively affected by downturns in the semiconductor industry 
factors that contribute to these industry downturns include the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  general decline in end user demand  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
historically  the semiconductor industry has experienced periodic downturns of varying degrees of severity and duration 
typically  after such downturns  semiconductor industry conditions improve  although such improvement may not be significant or sustainable 
increased demand for semiconductor industry products may not proportionately increase demand for programmable logic products in general  or our products in particular 
even if demand for our products increases  average sales prices for our products may not increase  and could decline 
whenever adverse semiconductor industry conditions or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
a downturn in the communications equipment and computing end markets could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue levels and operating results 
the majority of our revenue is derived from customers in the communications equipment and computing end markets 
any deterioration in these end markets or any reduction in technology capital spending could lead to a reduction in demand for our products 
whenever adverse economic or end market conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
we face risks related to implementation of new sarbanes oxley section controls audit requirements 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that our management assess our internal control over financial reporting annually and include a report on its assessment in our annual report 
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls and management s assessment of the design and the operating effectiveness of its internal controls 
through its assessment process  management believes there are no known material weaknesses at this time 
this is the first year we have undergone an audit of our internal controls and procedures 
we will continue to perform similar assessments and it is possible that material weaknesses will be found and reported to our shareholders in the future 
further  if we are unable to remediate any such weaknesses our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion on our internal controls 
if this were to occur  particularly in light of our restatement of quarterly financial statements  investor confidence regarding our internal controls could be harmed and our stock price could decline 
we face risks related to our recent accounting restatement 
on january   we announced that we had discovered possible accounting inaccuracies in previously reported quarterly financial statements 
an internal investigation was conducted by the audit committee of our board of directors to determine the scope and magnitude of these inaccuracies 
on march   we announced that the audit committee had completed its internal accounting investigation and  as a result  we restated our financial statements for the first  second and third quarters of to correct inappropriate accounting entries and a failure to record a change in accounting estimate related to deferred income 
on april   we filed such restated financial statements with form q a for the affected quarters 
the restatement of these financial statements has led to litigation claims and may lead to further litigation claims and or regulatory proceedings against us 
the defense of any such claims or proceedings may cause the diversion of management s attention and resources  and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims or proceedings are not resolved in our favor 
any litigation or regulatory proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses 
moreover  we may be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the financial statement inaccuracies and resulting restatement 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and reputation and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently implement our plan to improve our internal controls there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
we received notice from our independent registered public accounting firm that  in connection with the year end audit  the independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal controls and procedures relating to separation of duties and establishment of standards for review of journal entries and related file documentation 
although we have implemented various initiatives that have remedied this material weakness  we intend to make additional changes to our internal controls to address the issues that gave rise to the material weakness 
during our fiscal year end financial statement closing we identified a significant deficiency in our internal controls relating to a mechanical error in calculating a unique inventory allowance  which resulted from manual calculations performed by newly assigned employees who did not recognize that the required allowance had been calculated and recorded by existing procedures 
the error was not present in previously issued financial statements and was corrected before the current fiscal year end financial statements were issued 
additional training and review procedures have been instituted to remedy this situation 
during we intend to perform more staff training and staff cross training as well as identify ways to modify and automate our inventory compilation processes to make them less vulnerable to manual errors and implement related procedures 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully implement our revised internal controls and procedures or that our revised controls and procedures will have the desired effect 
in addition  we may be required to hire additional employees  and may experience higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses  during the implementation of these changes and thereafter 
furthermore  future assessments of our internal controls and procedures may reveal new material weaknesses or significant deficiencies 
if we are unable to implement the changes to our internal controls and procedures effectively or efficiently  or if we discover additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
moreover  we could be subject to additional regulatory oversight and our business and reputation could be harmed 
we face risks related to pending litigation 
in september and october  three putative class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the district of oregon against lattice semiconductor corporation  our chief executive officer cyrus y 
tsui  and our president stephen a 
skaggs 
these complaints were filed on behalf of a putative class of investors who purchased our stock between april  and april  they generally allege violations of federal securities laws arising out of our previously announced restatement of financial results for the first  second  and third quarters of consistent with the usual procedures for cases of this kind  these cases were amended and consolidated into a single action 
in such amended and consolidated complaint filed january  our former president and our former controller were added as defendants 
we believe that the complaints are without merit  and we intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuits 
in september and october  two shareholder derivative complaints were filed  purportedly on behalf of lattice semiconductor corporation  in the circuit court of the state of oregon for the county of washington  against all of our current directors  certain former directors  and certain executive officers 
the derivative plaintiffs make allegations substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaints  as well as allegations of breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  and unjust enrichment 
consistent with the usual procedures for cases of this kind  these cases were consolidated into a single putative shareholder derivative action 
an amended and consolidated complaint is expected to be filed by april  all of the complaints generally seek an unspecified amount of damages  as well as attorney fees and costs 
the cases are still in the preliminary stages  and it is not possible for us to quantify the extent of our potential liability  if any 
an unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition  defending any litigation may be costly and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business 
we are exposed to certain asserted and unasserted potential claims 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to potential claims made against us  we could resolve such claims under terms and conditions that would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  conditions within the end markets into which we sell our products  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  excessive inventory accumulation by our end customers  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the fabs of seiko epson  umc  chartered semiconductor  fujitsu or at other foundries  changes in manufacturing yields including delays in achieving target yields on new products  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
as a result of these factors  our past financial results are not necessarily a good predictor of our future results 
our stock price may continue to experience large fluctuations 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe and have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies 
at december   our book value per share was  compared to our stock price which has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share in the six months ended december  presently  our stock price is trading near our consolidated book value 
should our stock price drop below book value for a sustained period  it may become necessary to record an impairment charge to goodwill which would reduce our results of operations see note of our consolidated financial statements 
our wafer supply may be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers 
currently  our silicon wafers are manufactured by seiko epson in japan  umc in taiwan  and chartered semiconductor in singapore 
if any of our current or future foundry partners significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of our foundry partners were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our foundry partners foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we depend on our foundries to deliver reliable silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundries are unable for a prolonged period to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from products based on a specialized silicon wafer manufacturing process technology called e cmos 
the reliable manufacture of high performance e cmos semiconductor wafers is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in production wafers  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and us 
as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
if our assembly and test contractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we rely on contractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in assembly and packaging manufacturing  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly contractor and us 
as a result  our contractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
deterioration of conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
all of our major silicon wafer suppliers operate fabs located in asia 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent contractors located in china  japan  malaysia  the philippines  south korea and taiwan 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages  political unrest  war or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
export sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
our export sales are affected by unique risks frequently associated with foreign economies including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability  war or terrorism  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative technical solutions 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may be forced to use substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to any claims of infringement  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms  or at all  without our operating results being adversely affected 
our marketable securities  which we hold for strategic reasons  are subject to equity price risk and their value may fluctuate 
currently we hold substantial equity in umc  which we acquired as part of a strategic investment to obtain certain manufacturing rights 
the market price and valuation of these equity shares has fluctuated widely due to business  stock market or other conditions over which we have little control 
during the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax impairment loss related to this investment 
in the future  umc shares may continue to experience significant price volatility 
in and in  we sold a portion of our umc shares  but have otherwise not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques and hence substantial  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences a significant decline for an extended period of time  our operating results could be adversely affected 
changes in accounting for equity compensation will adversely affect operating results and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
we have historically used stock options as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles that require us and other companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning in the quarter ended september  to the extent that these or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we will incur increased compensation costs 
we may also change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december  our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of our portfolio would not be material 
furthermore  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our results from operations or statement of cash flows 
we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  we sell products to japanese customers denominated in yen 
we therefore are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to minimize foreign exchange risk related to yen based net assets on our consolidated balance sheet  on august   we entered into an agreement with a bank under the terms of which we can borrow up to million in japanese yen in a revolving line of credit arrangement 
outstanding borrowing is collateralized by marketable securities 
interest on outstanding borrowing is based on the japanese libor fixed rate  and averaged for the year ended december  outstanding borrowing at december  was million 
this arrangement can be terminated at anytime by either party 
we are exposed to equity price risk due to our equity investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
neither a increase nor a further decrease in equity price related to this investment would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as of december  or december  we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques 
as a result  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences further deterioration for an extended period of time  our operating results could be adversely affected
