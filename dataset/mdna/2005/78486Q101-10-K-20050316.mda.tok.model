when we refer to bancshares  we are referring only to the parent company  silicon valley bancshares 
for over years  we have been dedicated to helping entrepreneurs succeed  specifically focusing on industries where we have deep knowledge and relationships 
our focus is on the technology  life science  private equity  and premium wine industries 
we continue to diversify our products and services to support our clients throughout their life cycles  regardless of their age or size 
we offer a range of financial services that generate three distinct sources of income 
in part  our income is generated from interest rate differentials 
the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates received on interest earning assets  such as loans extended to clients and securities held in our investment portfolio  accounts for the major portion of our earnings 
our deposits are largely obtained from commercial clients within our technology  life science  private equity  and premium wine industry sectors  and  to a lesser extent  from individuals served by our private client services group 
we do not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and have no brokered deposits 
as part of negotiated credit facilities and certain other services  we frequently obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of warrants in certain client companies 
fee based services also generate income for our business 
we market our full range of financial services to all of our commercial and private equity firm clients 
in addition to commercial banking and private client services  we offer fee based merger and acquisition services  private placements  and investment and advisory services 
our ability to integrate and cross sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a strength of our business model 
in addition  we seek to obtain returns through investments in private equity and venture capital fund investments 
we manage three limited partnerships a venture capital fund that invests directly in privately held companies and two funds that invest in other venture capital funds 
critical accounting policies the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are the most critical to our audited consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our management regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
the financial impact of each estimate  to the extent significant to financial results  is discussed in the applicable sections of the management s discussion and analysis 
as of december   there have been no material changes to these policies since the last reporting period 
our senior management discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee on january  marketable equity securities our investments in marketable equity securities include by receipt of warrants for shares of publicly traded companies 
investments in shares of publicly traded companies 
equity securities in our warrant  direct equity  and venture capital fund portfolios generally become marketable when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a publicly reported market or is acquired by a publicly traded company 
unrealized gains on warrants and unrealized gains or losses on equity investment securities are recorded upon the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the underlying security  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity instruments 
unrealized gains or losses after applicable taxes  on available for sale marketable equity securities that result from initial public offerings are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
we are often contractually restricted from selling equity securities for a certain period of time subsequent to the portfolio company s initial public offering 
often equity securities held by us for sale are not registered under the securities act of the securities act 
in such cases  we often seek exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act by effecting sales of equity securities of the portfolio company in compliance with the current public information  holding period  volume limitation and manner of sale requirements of rule under the securities act 
in addition  as an inducement to the underwriter s to underwrite such an offering  security holders  including us  typically enter into an agreement with the underwriter s and or the portfolio company  pursuant to which the security holder agrees to refrain from selling the securities held by such holder for a period of time  often days  after the initial public offering 
as a result of such regulatory and contractual requirements  we are frequently restricted for some period of time in our ability to liquidate portfolio securities even after a portfolio company has completed an initial public offering 
gains or losses on these marketable equity instruments are recorded in our consolidated net income in the period the underlying securities are sold to a third party 
if we possess a warrant that can be settled with a net cash payment to us  the warrant meets the definition of a derivative instrument 
changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are recognized as securities gains or losses in our consolidated net income 
marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value  which initially is the purchase cost of the securities 
however  a decline in the fair value of any of these securities that is considered other than temporary is recorded in our consolidated net income in the period the impairment occurs 
the cost basis of the underlying security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
marketable equity securities held through our venture capital fund  silicon valley bancventures  lp  are recorded at fair value  which initially is the purchase cost of the securities 
holdings that are saleable without restriction are valued at the most recent stock exchange closing price prior to the valuation 
in addition  holdings that are subject to limitations under rule and or rule or underwriter lock ups  or in cases where bancshares and its affiliates could be considered an affiliate of the issuer are discounted to allow for possible price reduction due to restrictions on liquidity 
discounts will range dependent upon many factors  including but not limited to co investor discount s  trading volume  and price volatility 
we consider our marketable equity securities accounting policies to be critical  as the timing and amount of income  if any  from these instruments typically depend upon factors beyond our control 
these factors include the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
non marketable equity securities we invest in non marketable equity securities in several ways by receipt of warrants for shares of privately held companies 
by direct purchases of preferred or common stock in privately held companies 
by capital contributions to venture capital funds  which in turn make investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies 
through our venture capital fund  silicon valley bancventures  lp  which makes investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies 
through our funds of funds  svb strategic investors fund  lp and svb strategic investors fund ii  lp  which make investments in venture capital funds  which in turn  invest in privately held companies 
through our investments in partners for growth  lp and gold hill venture lending  lp  which provide financing to privately held companies in the form of loans and equity 
unexercised warrant securities in private companies are initially recorded at a nominal value on our consolidated balance sheets 
they are carried at this value until they become marketable or expire  except in the following circumstance gains on warrant and gains or losses on equity investment securities that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly traded company are marked to market when the acquisition occurs 
the resulting gains or losses are recognized into consolidated net income on that date  in accordance with emerging issues task force  issue no 
 nonmonetary exchange of cost method investments 
further fluctuations in the market value of these marketable equity securities are excluded from consolidated net income and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
upon the sale of these equity securities to a third party  gains and losses  which are measured from the adjusted cost basis  are recognized in our consolidated net income 
we account for non marketable equity investment securities  including warrants  other than those held by the svb strategic investors fund  lp  svb strategic investors fund ii  lp  silicon valley bancventures  lp  partners for growth  lp  and gold hill venture lending  lp  on a cost basis 
in the event of a stock based acquisition of a non publicly traded issuer by a publicly traded company  we will realize gains or losses on these securities in our consolidated net income when the transaction occurs 
a summary of our accounting policies for other non marketable equity securities is presented in the following table 
a complete description of the accounting policies follows the table

returns in excess of the cost basis are recorded as investment gains in noninterest income 
the values of the investments are reviewed at least quarterly  giving consideration to the facts and circumstances of each individual investment 
management s review of private equity investments typically includes the relevant market conditions  offering prices  operating results  financial conditions  and exit strategies

we consider our marketable and non marketable equity securities accounting policies to be critical  as the timing and amount of gain or losses  if any  from these instruments depend upon factors beyond our control 
these factors include the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
therefore  we cannot predict future gains or losses with any degree of accuracy and any gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period 
in addition  the valuation of non marketable equity securities included in our financial statements represents our best interpretation of the underlying equity securities performance at this time 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations  the estimated values of these securities may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future
