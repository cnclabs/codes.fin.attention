item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the section of this report  entitled factors that could affect our future financial performance  included in part i of this report  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business we provide authentication and grading and other services to dealers and collectors of high value collectible coins  sportscards  autographs and stamps that we believe add value to those collectibles by enhancing their marketability and  thereby  providing increased liquidity to the dealers and collectors that buy and sell these types of collectibles 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid by dealers and collectors for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we also generate revenues from the sale of advertising on our websites  the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications  and the sale of historical data and information about the collectibles authenticated and graded by us 
discontinued operations during the period from through the latter part of fiscal  we also were engaged in the business of marketing and selling collectible coins  sportscards and sports entertainment and historical memorabilia 
for the most part  those sales were made at multi venue auctions that were conducted by our collectibles sales divisions  including bowers and merena galleries and kingswood coin auctions for rare coins  superior sports auctions for vintage sportscards and sports memorabilia  odyssey publications for entertainment and historical memorabilia and lynn knight currency auctions for currency 
we also sold collectible coins  at retail  by direct sales methods 
at the authorization of our board of directors  in december  we adopted a plan to focus our financial and managerial resources  and collectibles expertise  on the operation and growth of our authentication and grading and other collectibles service businesses  and to divest our collectibles auctions and direct sales businesses 
the decision to implement this plan was based on a number of factors and considerations that included  among others  the historical operating results of the collectibles sales and auction businesses  which had proved to be disappointing as compared to the operating results of our authentication and grading businesses  a lack of synergies between the collectibles sales and auction businesses and our authentication and grading businesses  which made it difficult to achieve operational efficiencies and cost savings  and the additional capital that we believed would be required to grow our auction and retail sales businesses in comparison to the lower capital requirements of our authentication and grading businesses 
pursuant to that plan  during fiscal we sold our collectibles sales businesses 
we also terminated the licenses under which we operated our david hall rare coins division  which had been engaged in the business of selling collectible coins at retail 
however  we chose to retain and separately sell the collectibles inventories and collect the outstanding accounts receivables of those businesses 
by june  we had substantially liquidated those retained assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets and related liabilities of the collectible sales businesses have been classified as held for sale  their related operating results have been classified as discontinued operations and prior period financial statements have been restated on that same basis 
see selected consolidated financial data included in this annual report and our consolidated financial statements contained in part ii of this report 
as a result of our divestiture of our collectibles sales businesses  the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on our authentication and grading businesses  which comprise our continuing operations 
factors that can affect our financial position and operating results factors that can affect our revenues and cash flows 
the provision of authentication and grading services has provided relatively stable and predictable cash flows for us  as the fees for a significant proportion of the authentication and grading submissions we receive are prepaid 
in the years ended june   and  respectively  we generated cash of   and  respectively  from the operations of our continuing businesses 
during the year ended june  and  we generated cash of  and  from the sales of our collectibles sales businesses and the liquidation of the retained inventories and accounts receivable of those businesses 
as a result  at june   the remaining assets of those businesses  which we are in the process of liquidating  totaled  as compared to  at june  therefore  it is not expected that the company will generate any substantial cash flows from the sale of the remaining assets of the discontinued businesses in the future 
during the year ended june   five of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted for approximately of our total net revenues 
as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a lower level of activity by any of those customers  would cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could harm our profitability 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the owner of the largest of these customers encountered an unexpected and serious medical problem  which led to a decrease in revenues from that customer in the fourth quarter  compared to the third quarter of fiscal this reduction in revenues from that customer is expected to continue in fiscal in addition  the company s cash flows from investing activities can be impacted by the extent to which the company makes advances or receives repayments under the dealer financing program that was initiated in fiscal borrowings or repayments under the company s new line of credit  which will be classified as cash flows from financing activities  may offset the impact of such advances or repayment 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  of which  represented the net proceeds from our sale  in a public offering  of  shares of our common stock in the third quarter of we intend to use our cash resources to fund the growth of our authentication and grading businesses  including i the introduction of new services that we can offer our customers in our existing markets and ii the acquisition or start up of businesses that authenticate or grade other high value collectibles or other high value assets 
a description of the new services we plan to introduce and the acquisition opportunities we are exploring is contained in the section of this report entitled business our growth strategy in part i of this report 
factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins on authentication and grading submissions are primarily affected by the mix of collectibles submitted to us for grading i between coins and sportscards and ii between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand 
generally  the prices for authentication and grading of collectible coins are higher than those charged for the grading of sportscards  autographs or stamps 
in addition  our fees for authentication and grading of coins and sportscards vary depending on the turn around time requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times 
since  as a general rule  customers request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and sportscards than they do for modern submissions  the mix of submissions between vintage and modern collectibles also affects our profit margin 
impact of economic conditions on financial performance 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the high value collectibles markets 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by the financial performance of those markets  which depends to a great extent on i discretionary consumer spending and  hence  on the availability of disposable income  ii other economic conditions  including prevailing interest and inflation rates  which can affect consumer confidence and the performance of the stock market and the precious metals markets  and iii the performance and volatility of the precious metals and stock markets 
these conditions primarily affect the volume of purchases and sales of collectibles which  in turn  affects the volume of authentication and grading submissions to us  because our services facilitate commerce in collectibles 
accordingly  factors such as improving economic conditions which usually result in increases in disposable income and consumer confidence  and volatility in and declines in the prices of stocks and a weakening in the value of the us dollar  which lead investors to increase their purchases of precious metals  such as gold bullion and other coins  and other collectibles  usually result in increases in submissions of collectibles for our services 
by contrast  the volume of collectibles sales and purchases and  therefore  the volume of authentication and grading submissions  usually decline during periods characterized by recessionary economic conditions and by declines in disposable income and consumer confidence  and during periods characterized by increasing stock prices and relative stability in the stock markets 
we believe that the strengthening of the economy in the united states  together with the weakening of the us dollar  coupled with some continuing uncertainties over the longer term direction of the stock markets  and the prospect of increased inflation and higher interest rates  have contributed to an increase in the demand for gold and other precious metals and  therefore  also to the increases in our authentication and grading revenues during the years ended june  and  in each case as compared to the immediately preceding fiscal year 
the following table provides information regarding the respective numbers of coins  sportscards  autographs  stamps and currency that we graded or authenticated in the fiscal years ended june    and and their estimated values  which are the amounts at which those coins  sportscards  stamps and currency were insured by the dealers and collectors who submitted them to us for grading and authentication 
units processed coins sportscards autographs stamps currency total declared values coins sportscards autographs stamps currency total critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record certain of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of those assets  principally inventories and accounts receivable  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to realize the amounts at which our inventories are recorded  or to fully collect the accounts receivable shown  on our balance sheet 
those judgments  estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those conditions  trends and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in economic conditions or trends on which our judgments or estimates were based  or unanticipated events were to occur  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates that are affected by those changes 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets such as accounts receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events  and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were based  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record those assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events  such as occurred on september   or increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for their full effects to be measured 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which  and also regarding the amounts at which  sales are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on a number of factors  including whether customers are granted rights to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services provided to them return rights 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for possible write downs in their carrying values 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we record revenue at the time of shipment of the graded collectible to the customer 
our authentication and grading customers generally prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until their graded collectibles are shipped back to them 
at that time  we record the revenue from the authentication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend payment terms  usually of days duration  to many of the larger  more creditworthy collectibles dealers who submit collectibles to us for authentication and grading on a recurring basis 
we regularly review their accounts  estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible amounts on a quarterly basis 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due accounts  and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors to pay their accounts receivable balances 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each quarter and  based on that review  are revised to reflect changed circumstances or conditions in the quarterly period they become known 
for example  if the financial condition of certain dealers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments on their accounts  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by a charge against income that is recorded in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a warranty covering the coins  sportscards and currency we authenticate and grade 
we have recently begun offering a warranty covering the stamps that we authenticate and grade  if the dealer or collector requests that the stamp be returned to them in our tamper evident clear plastic holders 
under the warranty  if any coin  sportscard  currency or stamp that was previously graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon that resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the coin  sportscard or stamp or  at our election  to pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
however  this warranty is voided if the coin  sportscard  currency or stamp  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper evident clear plastic holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded it  or shows signs of tampering 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
to date our reserves have proved to be adequate 
however  if warranty claims were to increase in relation to historical trends and experience  we would be required to increase our warranty reserves and incur additional charges that would have the effect of reducing our income in those periods during which the warranty reserve is increased 
inventory valuation reserve 
our remaining collectibles sales inventories  which totaled approximately  at june  and our coin and other collectibles inventories used in our continuing operations  are valued at the lower of cost or market and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for declines in the estimated value of those inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions that may impact the sales values of our collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory  their valuation often involves judgments that are more subjective than the judgments involved in valuing more standardized products sold by other businesses 
if events or circumstances  such as changes in economic conditions  occur that we believe will make it more difficult  or will cause us to reduce the prices at which we will be able  to sell the collectibles  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
increases in this allowance will cause a decline in operating results  because such increases are recorded by charges against income 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  derived from our statements of operations for the respective periods indicated below fiscal years ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing expenses general administrative expenses settlement of lawsuit total operating expenses operating income interest income  net other  net income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of gain on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes net income loss net revenues 
net revenues consist primarily of fees generated from the grading and authentication of sportscards  coins and stamps and  to a much lesser extent  revenues from the sale of advertising and the publication of collectibles magazines 
net revenues are determined net of discounts and allowances 
the following tables sets forth certain information regarding the increases in net revenues and in the number of collectibles authenticated and graded in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal vs

increase decrease of net of net revenues units processed amount revenues amount revenues amounts percent number percent dollars in thousands coins sportscards other collectibles other collectibles consisted of autographs  stamps and currency in fiscal and autographs and stamps in and fiscal vs 
the number of coins  sportcards and other collectibles consisting of autographs  stamps and currency authenticated or graded in increased by  and  respectively  in  as compared to  resulting in a increase in the number of units authenticated and graded and a increase in net revenues 
also contributing to the increase in net revenues in were increases in sales of advertising and collectors club memberships totaling approximately  which includes an approximate  increase in on line advertising in  as compared to the average of the service fees earned for all collectibles was approximately the same in and however  modern coin revenues  for which the company earns a lower average service fee than for vintage coin submissions  accounted for a higher proportion of the coins authenticated and graded in  than in as a result  in  the increase in the number of coins authenticated and graded was greater than the increase in the net revenues 
fiscal vs 
the increase in net revenues in  compared to  was attributable to an overall increase of in the number of collectibles authenticated and graded  including a increase in the number of coins authenticated and graded  in as compared to the average fees paid for the grading of coins was higher in than in  due primarily to customers requesting faster turnaround times in  compared to coins accounted for of the total collectibles graded in fiscal as compared to in fiscal additionally  while the number of sportscards graded declined by in fiscal  as compared to  sportscard grading revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  because included a large bulk order for the grading of newly manufactured sportscards  for which the average selling price was lower than for the grading of sportscards submitted by dealers and collectors 
we believe that the increases in the demand for our coin grading services  both in and in  in each case as compared to the prior year  were largely attributable to two factors i an increase in purchases and sales of collectible and gold bullion coins by investors  which we believe was due in large part to a shift by investors of some of their funds from marketable securities to tangible assets  primarily in response to the decline in the value of the us dollar and uncertainties and volatility in the stock markets  and ii new marketing programs that we initiated in the second half of fiscal we believe that the increase in the number of other collectibles graded in versus was due largely to greater acceptance of and  therefore greater demand for  our grading services particularly among stamp dealers and collectors 
gross profit 
gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
cost of revenues consist primarily of labor to grade and authenticate coins  sportscards  autographs and stamps  production and printing costs  credit cards fees  warranty expense  and occupancy  security and insurance costs which directly relate to providing grading and authentication services 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin the increase in the gross profit margin in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to i increases of in coin authentication and grading revenues  on which we realize higher margins than on authentication and grading submissions of sportscards and other collectibles  ii the increases in net revenues described above  which caused the fixed elements of our costs of revenues to represent a lower percentage of total revenues than in  and iii increases  as compared to  in sales of website advertising  for which the cost of sales are minimal 
the increase in our gross profit margin in  as compared to  was due to a combination of factors  the most important of which consisted of i the increase in grading submissions of coins  on which we realize higher margins than on submissions of other collectibles for grading  and ii an overall increase in net revenues  which caused the fixed elements of our cost of revenues to represent a lower percentage of total revenues in as compared to selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of advertising and promotions costs  trade show related expenses  customer service personnel costs and third party consulting costs 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues the increase of  in selling and marketing expenses in  compared to  was primarily attributable to increases in general marketing expenses customer service personnel  advertising and trade show related costs in notwithstanding those increases  however  as a percentage of net revenues  selling and marketing expenses decreased from of net revenues in to in  indicating that we were able to increase authentication and grading revenues and sales of advertising without having to make commensurate increases in our selling and marketing expenses 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of  in  compared to  was due primarily to an increase of  in trade show related costs and other selling expenses in  compared to however  notwithstanding that increase  as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in general and administrative 
general and administrative g a expenses primarily include wages and payroll related expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  facility and security expenses  outside professional fees and service charges  travel related expenses and other general administrative expenses 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues although  as indicated in the table above  g a expenses increased by  in  as compared to  such expenses did not increase at the same rate as did net revenues  due primarily to improvements in operating efficiencies and staff reductions we were able to make as a result of the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses 
therefore  as a percentage of net revenues  g a expenses declined to in from for in dollar terms  the larger value components of the increases in g a expenses in  compared to  consisted primarily of i increases of approximately  in legal fees  including fees incurred on litigation matters  such as the real legends lawsuit discussed below  ii approximately  of costs incurred in connection with the launch of our new currency grading service during  iii consulting fees and audit costs of approximately  incurred in connection with the documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  iv new business development personnel and outside consulting costs of  incurred to develop and maintain our knowledge base in coins and to identify and analyze acquisition opportunities  and v general expenses and infrastructure costs incurred to support the increased volume of business that we conducted in  as compared with in  g a expenses decreased both in absolute dollars  by  and as a percentage of net revenues to from  as compared to the percentage decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in our net revenues in the dollar decrease in  as compared to  was the result primarily of i a reduction in administrative personnel made possible by the disposition of the collectibles sales businesses and ii a reduction in consulting fees incurred for services rendered to us in connection with securing state enterprise zone tax credits in  as compared to  which more than offset increases in g a expenses that were attributable to the increases in grading submissions in fiscal  as compared to fiscal settlement of lawsuit 
in january  without any admission of wrongdoing  we settled a legal action brought in the superior court of california for the county of san diego  by real legends  inc  a seller of sports cards plaintiff against when it was a game wiwag  a sports card dealer  and against us as a co defendant 
pursuant to the settlement terms  all of the claims asserted against the company by plaintiff were settled and plaintiff terminated the litigation  with prejudice  and we paid plaintiff  of which  was reimbursed to us by one of our insurers 
as a result  the net cost to us of the settlement in was  or of our net revenues 
goodwill impairment 
in  we recorded  as part of operating expenses  a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  related to continuing operations 
interest income  net 
interest income is generated on cash balances that we invest primarily in highly liquid money market accounts  short term bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper instruments 
interest income  net was  in   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the increase in interest income in compared to resulted primarily from increases in our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances that were attributable to i the cash generated from the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  ii the increases in income generated by our authentication and grading businesses  and iii the sale by us of  shares of our common stock in a public offering that we completed in the third quarter of  which generated net proceeds to us of  also contributing to the increase in interest income was an increase in the rates at which we earned interest on our cash and cash equivalent balances and the interest earned on the short term advances that we made to one of our customers 
the increase in interest income in as compared to was primarily attributable to interest earned on tax refunds that we received in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision made for income taxes in fiscal and and the income tax benefits recorded in fiscal were calculated on the basis of our expected federal and state effective income tax rates for those years 
contributing to the income tax benefit in fiscal were  of california enterprise zone hiring tax credits covering eligibility periods from to  for which required governmental approvals were obtained in the second quarter of fiscal income loss from discontinued operations 
as a result of our decision in fiscal to dispose of our collectibles sales businesses  in accordance with sfas the assets and related liabilities of those businesses have been classified as held for sale and their related operating results for fiscal years  and have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
therefore  in fiscal years  the loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes related to the operations of those discontinued businesses for the entire fiscal year and included a goodwill impairment charge of  in fiscal and  the income loss from discontinued operations includes i the losses from the operations of our discontinued collectibles sales businesses through the respective dates on which they were disposed of and ii the losses or gains recognized on the sales of those businesses and the disposition of those assets consisting primarily of inventories and accounts receivable that we retained 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  sfas no 
required us to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test as of the beginning of fiscal  the year of adoption of that new standard 
based on that test  it was determined that a substantial portion of our goodwill was impaired  and we recorded a non cash after tax charge of  or per diluted share  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  in fiscal quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these operating results  which reflect the reclassification of our results of operations between continuing operations and discontinued operations as a result of the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent periods 
generally  net revenues are lower during our second fiscal quarter that ends on december than in other quarterly periods  which we believe is related primarily to the holidays that take place during that quarter 
additionally  while net revenues increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  they declined by compared to the third quarter of fiscal  due primarily to the introduction of first strike see introducing new services in our existing markets in the third quarter of fiscal that provided approximately  in revenue on approximately  graded units  which activity  by its nature  occurs only in the third fiscal quarter 
although there is no assurance as to the level of future activity  we anticipate that the third quarter of fiscal will also recognize first strike revenue that  like fiscal  will not continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  although net revenues increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  that percentage increase was lower than the percentage increased in net revenues in each of the first three quarters of fiscal  as compared to the respective corresponding quarters of fiscal we believe this slowing in the growth of net revenues was largely due to two unrelated factors 
during the fourth quarter  we saw a slowing  which we believe is temporary  in the volume of gold trading  which impacts the volume of coins submitted to us for grading 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the owner of our largest customer encountered an unexpected and serious medical problem  which led to a decrease in revenues from that customer in the fourth quarter  compared with the third quarter of fiscal this reduction in revenues is expected to continue in fiscal our operating results also may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors which are outside of our control 
see business factors that could affect our future financial performance in part i of this report and factors that can affect our financial position and operating results earlier in this section of this report for a discussion of those factors

 june  selected operating data units authenticated or graded coins sportscards autographs stamps currency total liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  as compared to  at june  contributing to that increase were i net proceeds of  from our sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering that we completed in the third quarter of  ii the receipt  in the year ended june   of cash consideration that became determinable in  attributable to the sales of our collectibles sales businesses in fiscal  together with cash from collections of accounts receivables and from sales of collectibles inventories  which we chose to retain and liquidate ourselves  rather than sell to the buyers of those businesses  and iii increases in operating income that were primarily attributable to the increases in authentication and grading revenues 
historically  we have relied on internally generated funds  rather than borrowings  as our primary source of funds to support our grading operations 
we expect our authentication and grading services to provide us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows  largely because i in many instances our customers prepay for those services at the time they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading  and ii in the event of a decline in authentication and grading submissions  we believe we would be able to reduce our variable operating costs to offset  at least partially  the impact on our cash flows of such a decline 
during the year ended june   operating activities of our continuing operations provided net cash of  which represented an increase of  from the  of net cash generated in fiscal  that resulted primarily from an increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal  investing activities used net cash of  during the year ended june   primarily to fund net short term advances to two of our established customers of  and capital expenditures of  substantially offset by  in cash received from the sales of our discontinued businesses  and in the year ended june   financing activities provided net cash of million  primarily from the sale of the shares in our public offering during the third quarter ended march  and  to a much lesser extent  exercises of employee stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
currently  we have the following outstanding obligations under operating leases  net of sublease income for years ending june in fiscal we organized collectors finance corporation cfc  as a wholly owned subsidiary  to engage in the business of making short term loans primarily to coin dealers 
all such loans are required to be collateralized by the delivery to us of collectibles coins for authentication and grading that have a fair market value of at least the amount of the loans 
the loans are required to be repaid to us when those collectibles are returned to the dealers 
to provide a source of funding for those short term loans  in june cfc obtained a revolving bank line of credit pursuant to a loan and security agreement that permits cfc to borrow  at any one time  up to the lesser of i  or ii an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount of those of its loan receivables that meet the bank s eligibility criteria 
borrowings under that credit line  which has a term of two years  are secured by the loan receivables due cfc and a guarantee by the company 
other than i the obligation to repay any future borrowings under cfc s revolving credit line  which we expect will be paid with the proceeds of repayments of the loans made by cfc to its borrowers or the sale of the items collateralizing those loans  and ii the cash requirements of our on going operations  including the payment of rent obligations under operating leases  which we expect to be able to fund with internally generated funds  we do not have any material outstanding obligations 
we plan to use our cash resources  including the net proceeds from the sale of our shares in the public offering completed during the third quarter of  to i expand existing and implement new marketing programs  ii introduce new services for our customers in our existing markets  iii acquire or start up other high value collectibles or high value asset authentication and grading businesses  and iv fund working capital requirements  and for other general corporate purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
due to the cash and cash equivalent balances that we maintain  we are exposed to risk of changes in short term interest rates 
at june   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  primarily invested in a bank certificates of deposit  a money market fund and high grade commercial paper 
reductions in short term interest rates could result in reductions in the amount of that income 
however  the impact on our operating results of such changes is not expected to be material 
the company has no activities that would expose it to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risks
