item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general our primary business operations involve the origination and holding for investment and servicing of mortgage loans 
our profitability in any year is most affected by the principal amount of loans originated  the type of loans originated and the payoff and pay down of outstanding mortgage loans during such year 
these factors determine  to a significant extent  the interest income and fee income earned during such year 
we cannot project the principal amount or type of loans which will be originated in any year or those loan applications submitted to us which will be approved by our loan committee or board of trustees  as the case may be 
due to the short term nature of our loan portfolio and our no prepayment penalty policy  we cannot project the rate of payoffs or paydowns against our loan portfolio in any year 
as noted in the discussion below  both the fiscal year and the fiscal year reflect an increase in interest and fee income compared to the preceding fiscal year 
the primary reason for these increases is the significant increase in loan originations 
we cannot project nor have we ascertained any trends in our business other than that our loan originations have been more national in scope and our loan applications and loan originations have been for larger principal amounts 
both of these factors we attribute to the increase in our marketing activities 
vs 
interest and fees on loans increased to  for the year ended september   as compared to  for the year ended september   an increase of  or 
during the current fiscal year  we experienced an increase in the volume of loan originations that caused the average balance of loans outstanding to increase to  in the current fiscal year from  in the prior fiscal year 
this resulted in an increase in interest income of  increases in the prime rate of interest have caused the interest rate earned on our portfolio to increase from to  resulting in a  increase in interest income 
we recognized an increase of  in fee income in  which is consistent with the increased loan volume and an acceleration of amortization from the prepayment of loans 
we also realized an increase in interest income of  resulting from the collection of interest in excess of the stated rate on a loan that went into default the previous fiscal year but was paid in full in the current fiscal year 
offsetting these increases was a decline in interest income of  due to the receipt  in the prior year  of interest in excess of the stated rate on four loans that went into default during the prior year and subsequently returned to performing status 
operating income from real estate properties declined by  or  to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  this decline is due to the write off of  of straight line rent related to a retail tenant that filed for bankruptcy in october  offset by rental income derived from a multi family property that was acquired in foreclosure during the current fiscal year 
other income  primarily investment income  increased by  or from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was partially the result of a increase in the dividend paid on the epr shares from per share to per share 
during the fiscal year ended september   we also recognized  of income from the payoff of a loan  a portion of which was written off in a prior year 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase of  or  is due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds outstanding to fund increased loan originations  which increased by million  from million in the prior fiscal year to million in the current fiscal year 
this caused an increase in interest expense of  an increase in the average rate paid on borrowings from to caused  of the increase in interest expense 
the average interest rate includes the amortization of deferred borrowing costs and a 
fee  based on the value of the assets in the margin account  to maintain the margin account 
the advisor s fee paid to reit management corp  which is calculated pursuant to the advisory agreement  and is based on invested assets  increased  or  in the fiscal year ended september  to  from  in the fiscal year ended september  the increase is a result of a larger outstanding balance of invested assets  primarily loans  in the current fiscal year  thereby causing an increase in the fee 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase of  or  was the result of several factors 
payroll and payroll related expenses increased by  as a result of staff additions  increased commissions paid to loan originators and restricted stock amortization 
accounting expenses increased by  a result of sarbanes oxley compliance activities 
these increases were offset by a  decline in legal expenses that resulted from a decline in foreclosure related activities and the expensing in the prior year of legal costs associated with the organization of a de novo bank that we did not pursue 
the remaining increase in expense of  was due to higher operating expenses in several categories  none of which was significant 
other taxes decreased by  or  to  for the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease is the result of a decline of  in federal and state income taxes 
in the prior fiscal year we were liable for federal and state income taxes on earnings that were not distributed to shareholders 
this was offset by a  increase in the current fiscal year federal excise tax recorded 
the federal excise tax is based on taxable income during the current fiscal year not distributed 
operating expenses relating to real estate declined by  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  in the prior fiscal year  we incurred legal and other professional expenses of  in connection with a litigation related to a property that was sold in this litigation was resolved in june in the current year  we also refinanced the mortgage on an existing leasehold interest resulting in a reduction of interest expense of  offsetting these declines was an increase in operating expenses  primarily related to a property located in charlotte  north carolina that was acquired in foreclosure in the current fiscal year 
amortization and depreciation increased to  for the year ended september  from  in the year ended september   an increase of  or 
the increase relates to the charlotte  north carolina property 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase resulted from the sale of three cooperative units at one of our joint ventures  offset by a decline in rental income related to a property located in dover  delaware  where  upon a lease renewal  a major tenant reduced the amount of space it occupies 
gain on sale of available for sale securities declined  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  in the current fiscal year  we sold  shares of epr and other miscellaneous securities which resulted in net proceeds of  and had a cost basis of  in the prior fiscal year  we sold  shares of epr and  shares of atlantic liberty which resulted in net proceeds of  and had a cost basis of  for the fiscal year ended september   gain on sale of real estate assets  which is included in discontinued operations  increased to  from  in the fiscal year ended september  in the current fiscal year  the gain resulted from the sale of a shopping center located in wyoming 
in the prior fiscal year  the gain was the result of the sale of one condominium and four cooperative apartment units 
vs 
interest and fees on loans increased to  for the year ended september   as compared to  for the year ended september   an increase of  or 
during the fiscal year we experienced an increase in the volume of loan originations that caused the average balance of loans outstanding to increase to  in the fiscal year from  this resulted in an increase in interest income of  also contributing to an increase in interest income was the receipt of  of interest in excess of the stated rate on four loans that went into default during the year but have since been returned to performing 
offsetting these increases was a decline in the interest rate earned on the portfolio 
the average rate earned on the loan portfolio declined basis points from in the prior fiscal year to in the current fiscal year 
this resulted in a  decline in interest income 
also  in the prior fiscal year  we recognized  of interest income on the payoff of a loan that was previously recorded as non performing 
we recognized an increase of  in fee income in  which is consistent with the increased loan volume experienced during the period 
however this increase was offset by the collection of  in fees in the prior fiscal year that were due upon the payoff of two loans 
other income  primarily investment income  declined  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  during the first half of the current fiscal year and the last half of the prior fiscal year  we sold shares of epr and various other securities which resulted in a decline of  of dividend income 
offsetting this decline was an increase  from to  in the dividend paid on our remaining shares of epr which accounted for an increase of  the remaining  decline in investment income was the result of the sale of miscellaneous securities and reduction in the amount of funds available for investment 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase of  or  is due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds outstanding  which increased  from  in the prior fiscal year to  in the current fiscal year

payroll and payroll related expenses increased  as a result of staff additions  increased commissions paid to loan originators and restricted stock amortization 
there was also a  increase in expenses allocated to us  primarily legal and accounting expenses  pursuant to a shared services agreement among us and related entities 
legal expenses also increased  a result of three foreclosure actions that were pending and legal fees incurred in connection with the organization of a de novo bank 
we decided not to pursue the banking activity 
the remaining increase in expense of  was due to higher operating expenses in several categories  none of which was significant 
other taxes decreased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease is the result of a  reduction in the amount of excise tax recorded 
during the current year we increased the dividend paid to shareholders 
by paying to our shareholders more of our earnings within the prescribed time frame  we reduced the excise tax payment 
the excise tax is based on taxable income that has been generated but not yet distributed 
this was offset by the payment of  in federal income taxes in the current fiscal year on earnings that were not distributed to shareholders 
the remaining decline of  is due to a reduction in the amount of state franchise taxes paid in the current fiscal year

liquidity and capital resources we are primarily engaged in originating and holding for investment senior and junior commercial mortgage loans secured by real property in the united states 
from time to time  we also participate as both an equity investor in  and as a mortgage lender to  joint ventures which acquire income producing real property 
our focus is to originate loans secured by real property  which generally have high yields and are short term or bridge loans  with an average duration ranging from six months to three years 
repayments of real estate loans in the amount of million are due during the twelve months ending september   including million due on demand 
the availability of mortgage financing secured by real property and the market for buying and selling real estate is cyclical 
since these are the principal sources for the generation of funds by our borrowers to repay our outstanding real estate loans  we cannot project the portion of loans maturing during the next twelve months which will be paid or the portion of loans which will be extended for a fixed term or on a month to month basis 
we have two separate credit facilities with a group of banks consisting of north fork bank  valley national bank  merchants bank division and signature bank to finance our real estate mortgage lending 
under the credit facilities  north fork bank  valley national bank  merchants bank division and signature bank make available to us up to an aggregate of million on a revolving basis  of which million matures  under one facility  on february  with two one year extensions available to us  and million matures  under the other facility  on february  the maximum amount which can be outstanding under the credit facilities is the lesser of of the first mortgages pledged to the lending banks as collateral or million 
at september   million was available to be drawn based on the lending formula under our credit facilities and million was outstanding 
we also have the ability to borrow under our margin lines of credit maintained with national brokerage firms  secured by the common shares we own in epr and other investment securities 
under the terms of the margin lines of credit  we may borrow up to an amount equal to of the market value of the shares we own 
at september   million was available under the margin lines of credit  of which million was outstanding 
if the value of the epr shares our principal securities investment were to decline  the available funds under the margin lines of credit might decline and we could be required to repay a portion or all of the margin loans 
during the twelve months ended september   we generated cash of million from operating activities  million from collections from real estate loans and million from the sale of participations in loans originated by us 
these funds  in addition to cash on hand and funds borrowed under our revolving credit facilities and our margin lines of credit  were used primarily to fund real estate loan originations of million  and to pay cash distributions to shareholders in the amount of million 
we will satisfy our liquidity needs in the year ending september  from cash and cash investments on hand  the credit facilities with north fork bank  valley national bank  merchants bank division and signature bank  the availability in our margin lines of credit  interest and principal payments received on outstanding real estate loans  and net cash flow generated from the operation and sale of real estate assets 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth as of september  our known contractual obligations payment due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations      capital lease obligations operating lease obligation      purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on company balance sheet under gaap total      outlook the real estate business is cyclical and to a large extent depends  among other factors upon  national and local business and economic conditions  government economic policies and the level and volatility of interest rates 
a difficult or declining real estate market in the new york metropolitan area  in the state of florida  or in other parts of the country and a recessionary economy could potentially have the following adverse effects on our business i an increase in loan defaults which will result in decreased interest and fees on our outstanding real estate loans  ii an increase in loan loss reserves  iii an increase in expenses incurred in foreclosures and restructurings  iv a decrease in loan originations  v a decrease in rental income from properties owned by us or joint ventures in which we are a venture participant  and vi an increase in operating expenses related to real estate properties 
a declining real estate market however could also provide us with opportunities since  in a declining market  other lenders  particularly institutional lenders  become more conservative in their lending activities 
if such a lending environment should occur  the amount of potential business for us could increase 
since almost all of our loan portfolio provides for stated minimum or fixed interest rates  an increase or decrease in interest rates should not have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code since our organization 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently to our shareholders at least of our adjusted ordinary taxable income 
it is the current intention of our management to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the code and applicable regulations to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income  ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the code and applicable regulations thereunder 
for tax purposes  we report on a calendar year basis as distinguished from financial reporting purposes for which we are on a september th fiscal year 
we distributed substantially all of our taxable income for calendar by october we estimate taxable income for calendar will be million  of which approximately million is expected to represent capital gain income 
to comply with the time frames prescribed by the code and the applicable regulations thereunder  at least of the calendar ordinary taxable income is required to be declared by september  and  assuming we continue to pay the quarterly dividends on or about the st day of each calendar quarter january st  april st  july st and october st  distributed by october  it is our intention to pay to our shareholders within the time periods prescribed by the code substantially all of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on sale of available for sale securities 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to understand our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments and estimates by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include the following allowance for possible losses we review our mortgage portfolio  real estate assets underlying our mortgage portfolio and owned by us and the real estate assets owned by joint ventures in which we are an equity participant on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of the real estate assets underlying our loans or any impairment in the value of any of such real estate assets  in order to determine if there is a need for a provision for an allowance for possible losses against our real estate loans or an impairment allowance against real estate assets 
in reviewing the value of the collateral underlying our loan portfolio  our real estate assets  and the real estate assets owned by joint ventures in which we are an equity participant  we seek to arrive at the fair value of the underlying collateral or such real estate on an individual basis by taking into account numerous factors  including  market evaluations of the underlying collateral or the real estate  estimated operating cash flow from the property during a projected holding period and an estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
each of these factors entails significant judgments and estimates 
real estate assets held for use and real estate assets owned by joint ventures are evaluated for indicators of impairment using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
if that analysis suggests that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property will be insufficient to recover our investment  an impairment provision will be calculated based upon the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its fair value 
real estate assets which are held for sale are valued at the lower of the recorded cost or estimated fair value  less the cost to sell 
we do not obtain any independent appraisals of either the real property underlying our loans or the real estate assets which are held by us and by the joint ventures in which we are an equity participant  but we rely on our own in house analysis and valuations 
any valuation allowances taken with respect to our loan portfolio or real estate assets will reduce our net income  assets and shareholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation allowance  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
no additional valuation allowance was recorded against our mortgage portfolio in the fiscal year ended september  and no valuation adjustment was recorded in fiscal against any real estate assets 
revenue recognition we recognize interest income and rental income on an accrual basis  unless we make a judgment that impairment of a loan or of real estate owned renders doubtful collection of interest or rent in accordance with the applicable loan documents or lease 
in making a judgment as to the collectibility of interest or rent  we consider  among other factors  the status of the loan or property  the borrower s or tenant s financial condition  payment history and anticipated events in the future 
income recognition is suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management  a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and continued performance is demonstrated 
accordingly  management must make a significant judgment as to whether to treat a loan or real estate owned as impaired 
if we make a decision to treat a problem loan or real estate asset as not impaired and therefore continue to recognize the interest and rent as income on an accrual basis  we could overstate income by recognizing income that will not be collected and the uncollectible amount will ultimately have to be written off 
the period in which the uncollectible amount is written off could adversely affect taxable income for a specific year and our ability to pay cash distributions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary component of market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income  and to a lesser extent our interest expense  are subject to changes in interest rates 
we seek to minimize these risks by originating loans that are indexed to the prime rate  with a stated minimum interest rate  and borrowing  when necessary  from our available revolving bank credit lines which are also indexed to the prime rate 
at september   approximately of our portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans tied primarily to the prime rate 
changes in the prime interest rate would affect our net interest income accordingly 
when determining interest rate sensitivity  we assume that any change in interest rates is immediate and that the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remain constant over the period being measured 
we assessed the market risk for our variable rate mortgage receivables and variable rate debt and believe that a one percent increase in interest rates would cause an increase of income before taxes of million and a one percent decline in interest rates would cause an increase of income before taxes of approximately  in addition  we originate loans with short maturities and maintain a strong capital position 
as of september   a majority of our loan portfolio was secured primarily by properties located in the new york metropolitan area  including new jersey and connecticut  and in florida  and it is therefore subject to risks associated with the economies of these localities
