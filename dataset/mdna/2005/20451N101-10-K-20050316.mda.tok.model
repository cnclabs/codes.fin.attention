chemical customers accounted for approximately of our gross sales of salt 
principal customers are producers of intermediate chemical products used in pulp bleaching  water treatment and a variety of other industrial uses 
our customers do not have a captive source of brine 
distribution into the chemical market is made primarily through multi year supply agreements  which are negotiated privately 
price  service  product quality and security of supply are the major competitive market factors

in north america  other large  nationally recognized companies compete against our highway deicing and chemical salt products 
in addition  there are several smaller regional producers of highway deicing salt 
there are several importers of salt into north america but these mostly impact the eastern seaboard where we have a minimal position 
in the united kingdom  there are two other companies that produce highway deicing salt  one in northern england and the other in northern ireland 
there are no significant imports of highway deicing salt into the united kingdom 
general trade salt products products and sales the general trade business accounted for approximately of our gross sales of salt 
we are the third largest producer of general trade salt in north america 
this product line includes commercial and consumer applications  such as table salt  water conditioning  consumer ice control  food processing  agricultural applications  as well as a variety of industrial applications 
we believe that we are the largest private label producer of water conditioning and salt based agricultural products in north america and sell more than private labels of table salt to major retailers 
our sifto brand is well recognized in the canadian market 

table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k in the united kingdom we operate the largest evaporated salt plant in the united kingdom at weston point 
we are one of the uk s market leaders in branded evaporated salt for water conditioning 
we also produce salt for the food  chemical  animal feeds and textile markets 
we have maintained a significant presence in the general trade business over recent years due to our strong focus on i the midwestern region of the united states  ii all of canada and the united kingdom  iii our distribution network to the grocery trade  and iv our relationships with large distributors of water conditioning salt 
the general trade market is driven by strong customer relationships 
sales in the general trade salt product line occur through retail channels  such as grocery stores  building supply  hardware and automotive stores and feed suppliers 
distribution in the general trade salt product line is channeled through a direct sales force located in various parts of our service territories who sell products to distributors  dealers and end users 
we also maintain a network of brokers who sell table salt  consumer deicing and water conditioning products 
these brokers service wholesalers  grocery chains and retailers  as well as the food service industry

specialty potash segment sop is primarily used as a specialty fertilizer  providing essential potassium to high value  chloride sensitive crops  such as vegetables  fruits  tea  potatoes  grapes  nuts  tobacco and turf grass 
we are the market leader in north america for sop and market sop products both domestically and overseas 
we offer several grades of sop  which are designed to better serve the special needs of our customers 
in  the specialty potash segment accounted for approximately of our sales after shipping and handling costs 
potash industry overview the annual worldwide consumption of all potash fertilizers approaches million tons 
muriate of potash  or potassium chloride  is the most common source of potassium and accounts for over of all potash consumed in fertilizer production 
sop represents about of potash consumption 
the remainder is supplied in the forms of potassium magnesium sulfate  nitrate of potassium and  to a lesser extent  potassium thiosulfate and monopotassium phosphate 
all of these products contain varying concentrations of potassium expressed as potassium oxide ko and different combinations of co nutrients 
muriate of potash is the least expensive form of potash fertilizer based on the concentration of ko it is the preferred potassium source for most crops 
however  sop containing approximately ko is utilized by growers for many high value crops  especially where the requirements are for fertilizers with low chloride content 
the use of sop has been scientifically proven to improve the yield and quality of certain crops 
examples of crops where sop is utilized to increase yield and quality include tobacco  tea  potatoes  citrus fruits  grapes  almonds  some vegetables and on turfgrass  including turf for golf courses 
approximately of our annual sop sales volumes in were made to domestic customers  which include retail fertilizer dealers and distributors of professional turf care products 
these dealers and distributors combine or blend sop with other fertilizers and minerals to produce fertilizer blends tailored to individual requirements 
operations and facilities all of our sop production is located on the great salt lake west of ogden  utah 
it is the largest sop production facility in north america 
the evaporation facility utilizes solar energy and operates over  acres of evaporation ponds to manufacture sop and magnesium chloride from the brines of the great salt lake 
the property utilized in our operation is both owned and leased under annually renewing leases 
this facility has the capacity to annually produce approximately  tons of sop  approximately  tons of magnesium chloride and over million tons of salt 
these recoverable minerals exist in vast quantities in the great salt lake 
we estimate the recoverable minerals exceed years of reserves at current production rates and capacities 
our rights to extract these minerals are contractually limited 
we believe we will continue to be able to extend these agreements  as we have in the past  at commercially reasonable terms  without incurring substantial costs or incurring material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions

form k thereby allowing us to extract additional quantities of minerals necessary to significantly extend the economic life of the reserves 
the potassium bearing salts are mechanically harvested and refined to high purity sop in an integrated production facility that has been in operation since we believe that our property and operating equipment are maintained in good working condition 
the ogden facility was unable to produce sop from through the beginning of due to flooding 
following the flood  dikes were raised to a height three feet over the historic peak flood level 
also  the state of utah constructed and implemented the west desert pumping project  which could be utilized to lower the level of the great salt lake by up to inches per year thus reducing the risk of flooding 
although we believe that the subsequent dike improvements and the west desert pumping project have reduced the likelihood of future pond flooding  we maintain both property damage and business interruption insurance policies for this risk 
products and sales our domestic sales of sop are concentrated in the western states of california  oregon  washington  idaho and the central tobacco belt area where the crops and soil conditions favor sop 
we generally export sop through major trading companies 
international sop sales volumes in were of our annual sop sales 
beginning in late  we organized and employed an experienced global sales group to focus on the specialty aspects and benefits of sop as a source of potassium nutrients 
we believe our sales growth over the past few years has been positively influenced by reestablishing this specialty marketing focus 
the table below shows our shipments of sop to the following regions thousands of tons year ended december  tons tons tons us export a total a export sales include product sold to foreign customers at us ports 
competition approximately of the world sop capacity is located in europe  in the united states and the remaining in various other countries 
the world consumption of sop totals about million tons 
our major competition for sop sales in north america include imports from germany  chile  canada and belgium 
in addition  there is also some functional competition between sop  muriate of potash and nitrate of potash 
for exports into asia  the pacific rim countries and latin america  we compete with various local and european producers 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret protection  employee and third party non disclosure agreements  license arrangements and domain name registrations to protect our intellectual property

permits or licenses are obtained as needed in the normal course of business based on our mine plans and state  provincial and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing 
based on our historical permitting experience  we expect to be able to continue to obtain necessary mining permits to support historical rates of production 
our mineral leases have varying terms 
some will expire after a set term of years  while others continue indefinitely 
many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific amount per ton of mineral extracted or as a percentage of revenue

form k the following map shows the locations of our principal salt and sop production facilities map of north america and united kingdom environmental  health and safety matters we produce and distribute crop and animal nutrients  salt and deicing products 
these activities subject us to an evolving set of international  federal  state  provincial and local environmental  health and safety ehs laws that regulate  or propose to regulate i product content  ii use of products by both us and our customers  iii conduct of mining and production operations  including safety procedures followed by employees  iv management and handling of raw materials  v air and water quality impacts from our facilities  vi disposal  storage and management of hazardous and solid wastes  vii remediation of contamination at our facilities and third party sites  and viii post mining land reclamation 
for new regulatory programs  it is difficult for us to ascertain future compliance obligations or estimate future costs until implementing regulations have been finalized and definitive regulatory interpretations have been adopted 
we intend to respond to these regulatory requirements at the appropriate time by implementing necessary modifications to our facilities and or operating procedures 
we have expended  and anticipate that we will continue to expend  substantial financial and managerial resources to comply with ehs standards 
we estimate that our ehs capital expenditures will total approximately million  primarily related to air quality devices and highway deicing salt storage pads 
we expect that our estimated expenditures in for reclamation activities will be approximately million 
it is possible that greater than anticipated ehs capital expenditures or reclamation expenditures will be required in or in the future 
we maintain accounting accruals for certain contingent environmental liabilities and believe these accruals comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we record accruals for environmental investigatory and non capital remediation costs when litigation has commenced or a claim or assessment has been asserted or is imminent  the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the financial impact of such outcome is reasonably estimable 
based on current information  it is the opinion of management that our contingent liabilities arising from ehs matters  taking into account established accruals  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   we had recorded environmental accruals of million 
product requirements and impacts international  federal  state and provincial standards i require registration of many of our products before such products can be sold  ii impose labeling requirements on those products  and iii require producers to manufacture the products to formulations set forth on the labels

the us environmental protection agency  or the epa  the state of california and the fertilizer institute have each completed independent assessments of potential risks posed by crop nutrient materials 
these assessments concluded that  based on the available data  crop nutrient materials generally do not pose harm to human health 
it is unclear whether any further evaluations may result in additional standards or regulatory requirements for the producing industries  including us  or for our customers 
at this stage  it is the opinion of management that the potential impact of these standards on the market for our products or on the expenditures that may be necessary to meet new requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the canadian government released a priority substances list assessment report for road salt 
this report found that road salts are entering the environment under conditions that may have a harmful effect or constitute a danger to the environment 
based on this report  the minister of environment has proposed designating road salt as a toxic substance pursuant to the canadian environmental protection act 
canada s federal cabinet  which has ultimate responsibility  has not yet taken final action with respect to this proposal and is not subject to any deadline to do so 
this proposal was subject to a public comment  during which individuals and the municipalities which comprise most of our customers expressed a variety of views  including noting the utility and cost efficiency of salt as compared to other potential measures to reduce ice related road hazards 
at this point  environment canada has indicated that  whether or not road salts are declared toxic  their preferred course of action is the establishment of voluntary guidelines for users as opposed to any form of regulation 
environment canada has been developing these guidelines based on consultation with a broad based stakeholders group  which includes the salt industry 
on april   environment canada published a code of practice to serve as these guidelines 
the code of practice requires large road salt users to develop salt management plans 
we do not believe that this will have a material direct effect on us  but the new salt management plans may lead our customers in canada to require less road salt 
given the importance of road salt for traffic safety and the current lack of any practical substitute  we deem it unlikely that any guidelines or regulations would result in a complete ban on the use of road salt 
as noted in the december report  the use of road salt and other deicing agents is an important component of strategies to keep roadways open and safe during the winter and minimize traffic crashes  injuries and mortality under icy and snowy conditions 
the report further stated that mitigation measures must be based on optimization of winter road maintenance practices so as not to jeopardize road safety  while minimizing the potential for harm to the environment 
environment canada recently confirmed the high importance of road safety in its proposed regulation of road salt 
in its september  press release in connection with the proposed code of practice  it indicated that the proposed code will provide those who use road salts with a way to reduce harm to the environment without jeopardizing road safety 
since the dissemination of the december report  we have endeavored to work more closely with the national government as well as provinces and municipalities to better manage the use  storage and release of our road salts 
as a result  we believe it has become less likely that road salts will be designated as a toxic substance 
we cannot predict whether the proposal to designate road salt as a toxic substance will be finalized or the promulgation of any other future regulation 
standardized guidelines for the use and storage of road salt or any alternate deicing products may cause us to suffer reduced sales and incur substantial costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  while we are not aware of any similar governmental proposals for such designation of road salt in either the united states or the united kingdom  we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not arise 
operating requirements and impacts we hold numerous environmental  mining and other permits or approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities 
our operations are subject to permits for extraction of salt and brine  discharges of process materials to air and surface water  and injection of brine and wastewater to subsurface wells 
some of our proposed activities may require waste storage permits 
a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval  or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 
in addition  changes to environmental and mining regulations or permit requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 
expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 
pursuant to the mine safety and health act  new interim regulatory standards for diesel particulate matter became effective in and final standards are expected to become effective in in response to litigation regarding its final rule on diesel particulate matter  the mine safety and health administration has initiated a new rule regarding certain provisions of the final standards 
we are currently in compliance with the interim standards that are in effect between and however  material expenditures may be required to achieve compliance with the final standards at the cote blanche facility in louisiana

form k remedial activities remediation at our facilities many of our formerly owned and current facilities have been in operation for a number of years 
operations have historically involved the use and handling of regulated chemical substances  salt and by products or process tailings by us and predecessor operators which have resulted in soil  surface water and groundwater contamination 
at many of these facilities  spills or other releases of regulated substances have occurred previously and potentially could occur in the future  possibly requiring us to undertake or fund cleanup efforts under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  or state and provincial or united kingdom laws governing cleanup or disposal of hazardous substances 
in some instances  we have agreed  pursuant to consent orders or agreements with the appropriate governmental agencies  to undertake investigations  which currently are in progress  to determine whether remedial action may be required to address such contamination 
at other locations  we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform required remedial activities that will address identified site conditions 
at still other locations  we have undertaken voluntary remediation  and have removed formerly used underground storage tanks 
taking into account established reserves  expenditures for these known conditions currently are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to be material 
however  material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at these or at other current or former sites 
in addition  in connection with the recapitalization  mosaic has agreed to indemnify us against liabilities for certain known and unknown conditions at existing and former sites 
the wisconsin department of agriculture  trade and consumer protection datcp reportedly has information indicating that agricultural chemicals are present in the groundwater in the vicinity of the kenosha  wisconsin plant 
datcp has directed us to conduct an investigation into the possible presence of agricultural chemicals in soil and groundwater at the kenosha plant 
we are working with datcp to develop and implement a plan to investigate soils and groundwater at the kenosha site 
depending on the results of the investigation  remedial efforts may be necessary 
although little is currently known about the possible source of such contamination  or who should be responsible for it  we expect datcp will again look to us to undertake those efforts 
if required  we intend to conduct all phases of the investigation and any required remediation work under the wisconsin agricultural chemical cleanup program  which will provide for reimbursement of some of the costs 
none of the identified contaminants have been used in association with compass minerals site operations 
we expect to seek participation by  or cost reimbursement from  other parties responsible for the presence of any agricultural chemicals found in soils at this site 
remediation at third party facilities along with impacting the sites at which we have operated  various third parties have alleged that our historic operations have resulted in contamination to neighboring off site areas or nearby third party facilities 
cercla imposes liability  without regard to fault or to the legality of a party s conduct  on certain categories of persons who are considered to have contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment 
under cercla  or its various state analogues  one party may potentially be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties 
we have entered into de minimis settlement agreements with the epa with respect to several cercla sites  pursuant to which we have made one time cash payments and received statutory protection from future claims arising from those sites 
in some cases  however  such settlements have included reopeners  which could result in additional liability at such sites in the event of newly discovered contamination or other circumstances 
at other sites for which we have received notice of potential cercla liability  we have provided information to the epa that we believe demonstrates that we are not liable  and the epa has not asserted claims against us with respect to such sites 
in some instances  we have agreed  pursuant to orders from or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies or agreements with private parties  to undertake or fund investigations  some of which currently are in progress  to determine whether remedial action  under cercla or otherwise  may be required to address contamination 
at other locations  we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform required remedial activities that will address identified site conditions 
at the present time  we are not aware of any additional sites for which we expect to receive a notice from the epa or any other party of potential cercla liability 
however  based on past operations  there is a potential that we may receive notices in the future for sites of which we are currently unaware or that our liability at currently known sites may increase 
taking into account established accruals  expenditures for our known environmental liabilities and site conditions currently are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to be material or have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

our highway deicing product line is seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter as a result of weather conditions and other factors 
over the last four years  our north american highway deicing product line has generated over of its annual sales  net of shipping and handling costs  during the months of december through march when the need for highway deicing is at its peak 
we need to stockpile sufficient highway deicing salt in the last three fiscal quarters to meet estimated demand for the winter season 
weather conditions that impact our highway deicing product line include temperature  levels of precipitation  number of snow days and duration and timing of snow fall in our relevant geographic markets 
lower than expected sales by us during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock 
our sop operating results are dependent in part upon conditions in the agriculture markets 
the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors  the most important of which for us markets are weather patterns and field conditions particularly during periods of traditionally high crop nutrients consumption and quantities of crop nutrients imported to and exported from north america 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  including approximately million under our senior credit facilities  million under our revolving credit facility  million of compass minerals group s senior subordinated notes  million of our senior discount notes  million of our senior subordinated discount notes  and a stockholders deficit of million 
this level of leverage could have important consequences  including the following it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy  it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes  and it may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition if we are unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing  as needed 
in addition  our indentures and our senior credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants discussed below that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 
see restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and certain indebtedness of compass minerals group may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
we are a holding company with no operations of our own and depend on our subsidiaries for cash 
although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries  none of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us for payment on our indebtedness or to pay dividends on our capital stock 
accordingly  our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and distribute dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries 
the terms of our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes of compass minerals group significantly restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us 
furthermore  our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our senior credit facilities and other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends or the making of loans by our subsidiaries to us 
the terms of our senior credit facilities also restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends to us in order to fund cash interest on our senior discount notes and senior subordinated discount notes if we do not maintain an adjusted senior indebtedness leverage ratio of or less as of december  or if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under our senior credit facilities 
as of december   our adjusted senior indebtedness leverage ratio was

in addition  our senior credit facilities require us to maintain financial ratios 
these financial ratios include an interest coverage ratio and a consolidated indebtedness leverage ratio 
although we have historically been able to maintain these financial ratios  we may not be able to maintain these ratios in the future 
covenants in our senior credit facilities may also impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to enter into acquisitions or joint ventures or engage in other favorable business activities 
if we default under our senior credit facilities under certain circumstances  the lenders could require immediate payment of the entire principal amount 
these circumstances include a change of control  default under agreements governing our other indebtedness  material judgments in excess of  or breach of representations and warranties 
any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under our other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the lenders under our senior credit facilities require immediate repayment  we will not be able to repay them and also repay our other indebtedness in full 
our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business  including economic loss and a negative impact on earnings 
since we manufacture and sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our sales outside the united states  as a percentage of our total sales  were for the year ended december  accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  exchange controls  tariffs  other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  differing labor regulations  requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  restrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries  make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions  restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may adversely affect our results of operations 
because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars  if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 
in addition  our debt service requirements are primarily in us dollars even though a significant percentage of our cash flow is generated in canadian dollars and pounds sterling 
significant changes in the value of canadian dollars and pounds sterling relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on us dollar denominated debt 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enter into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
given the volatility of exchange rates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and or translation risks

our operations are dependent on natural gas and significant interruption in the supply or increase in the price of natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
energy costs  including primarily natural gas and electricity  represented approximately of the costs of our north american salt production in natural gas is a primary fuel source used in the evaporated salt production process 
our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a policy of hedging natural gas prices through the use of swap agreements 
we have not entered into any long term contracts for the purchase of natural gas 
our contractual arrangements for the supply of natural gas do not specify quantities and are automatically renewed annually unless either party elects not to do so 
we do not have arrangements in place with back up suppliers 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or covered through our hedging arrangements  or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas to our production facilities  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
competition in our markets could limit our ability to attract and retain customers  force us to continuously make capital investments and put pressure on the prices we can charge for our products 
we encounter competition in all areas of our business 
competition in our product lines is based on a number of considerations  including product performance  transportation costs in salt distribution  brand reputation  quality of client service and support  and price 
additionally  customers for our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency 
our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully 
to remain competitive  we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
environmental laws and regulation may subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs in the future 
we are subject to numerous environmental  health and safety laws and regulations in the united states  canada and europe  including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation and remediation of hazardous substance releases  and discharges to air and water 
for example cercla  imposes liability  without regard to fault or to the legality of a party s conduct  on certain categories of persons known as potentially responsible parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment 
although we are not currently incurring material liabilities pursuant to cercla  we may in the future incur material liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws  with regard to our current or former facilities  adjacent or nearby third party facilities  or off site disposal locations 
under cercla  or its various state analogues  one party may  under some circumstances  be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties 
liability under these laws involves inherent uncertainties 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws are subject to civil  and in some cases  criminal sanctions 
we have received notices from governmental agencies that we may be a potentially responsible party at certain sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws 
we have entered into de minimis settlement agreements with the united states with respect to certain cercla sites  pursuant to which we have made one time cash payments and received statutory protection from future claims arising from those sites 
at other sites for which we have received notice of potential cercla liability  we have provided information to the epa  that we believe demonstrates that we are not liable and the epa has not asserted claims against us with respect to such sites 
in some instances  we have agreed  pursuant to consent orders or agreements with the appropriate governmental agencies  to undertake investigations  which currently are in progress  to determine whether remedial action may be required to address such contamination 
at other locations  we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform remedial activities that will address identified site conditions 
at the present time  we are not aware of any additional sites for which we expect to receive a notice from the epa of potential cercla liability 
however  based on past operations there is a 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k potential that we may receive such notices in the future for sites of which we are currently unaware 
taking into account established reserves  expenditures for our known environmental liabilities and site conditions currently are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to be material 
however  material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at these or at other current or former sites 
we have also developed alternative mine uses 
for example  we entered into a joint venture with a subsidiary of violia environnement that is in the waste management industry 
the joint venture has a permit to allow for the storage of certain stable types of hazardous waste in our salt mine in the united kingdom 
we believe that the mine is stable and should provide a secure storage location 
however  we recognize that any temporary or permanent storage of hazardous waste may involve risks to the environment 
although we believe that we have taken these risks into account as much as possible in our planning process  it is possible that material expenditures could be required in the future to further reduce this risk  or to remediate any future contamination 
continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments for environmental controls at ongoing operations  which will be charged against income from future operations 
present and future environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations may require substantial capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

the canadian government s proposal to designate road salt as a toxic substance could have a material adverse effect on our business  including reduced sales and the incurrence of substantial costs and expenditures 
in december  the canadian government released a priority substances list assessment report for road salt 
this report found that road salts are entering the environment under conditions that may have a harmful effect or constitute a danger to the environment 
based on this report  the minister of environment has proposed designating road salt as a toxic substance pursuant to the canadian environmental protection act 
canada s federal cabinet  which has ultimate responsibility  has not yet taken final action with respect to this proposal and is not subject to any deadline to do so 
this proposal was subject to a public comment  during which individuals and the municipalities which comprise most of our customers expressed a variety of views  including noting the utility and cost efficiency of salt as compared to other potential measures to reduce ice related road hazards 
at this point  environment canada has indicated that  whether or not road salts are declared toxic  their preferred course of action is the establishment of voluntary guidelines for users as opposed to any form of regulation 
environment canada has been developing these guidelines based on consultation with a broad based stakeholders group  which includes the salt industry 
on april   environment canada published a code of practice to serve as these guidelines 
the code of practice requires large road salt users to develop salt management plans 
we do not believe that this will have a material direct effect on us  but the new salt management plans may lead our customers in canada to require less road salt 
given the importance of road salt for traffic safety and the current lack of any practical substitute  we deem it unlikely that any guidelines or regulations would result in a complete ban on the use of road salt 
as noted in the december report  the use of road salt and other deicing agents is an important component of strategies to keep roadways open and safe during the winter and minimize traffic crashes  injuries and mortality under icy and snowy conditions 
the report further stated that mitigation measures must be based on optimization of winter road maintenance practices so as not to jeopardize road safety  while minimizing the potential for harm to the environment 
environment canada recently confirmed the high importance of road safety in its proposed regulation of road salt 
in its september  press release in connection with the proposed code of practice  it indicated that the proposed code will provide those who use road salts with a way to reduce harm to the environment without jeopardizing road safety 
since the dissemination of the december report  we have endeavored to work more closely with the national government as well as provinces and municipalities to better manage the use  storage and release of our road salts 
as a result  we believe it has become less likely that road salts will be designated as a toxic substance 
we cannot predict whether the proposal to designate road salt as a toxic substance will be finalized or the promulgation of any other future regulation 
standardized guidelines for the use and storage of road salt or any alternate deicing products may cause us to suffer reduced sales and incur substantial costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  while we are not aware of any similar governmental proposals for such designation of road salt in either the united states or the united kingdom  we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not arise 
our operations are dependent on our rights to mine our property and having received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities 
we hold numerous governmental  environmental  mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities 
a decision by a governmental agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval  or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue

expansion of our existing operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 
we currently do not have any material pending permits or approvals 
in addition  we have become aware of an aboriginal land claim filed by the chippewas of nawash and the chippewas of saugeen the chippewas in the ontario superior court against the attorney general of canada and her majesty the queen in right of ontario 
the chippewas claim that large part of the land under lake huron was never conveyed by treaty and therefore belongs to the chippewas

protection of proprietary technology our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 
we cannot assure you that any of our applications for protection of our intellectual property rights will be approved or that others will not infringe or challenge our intellectual property rights 
the patents we currently have in place expire between and we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology 
to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
many of our important brand names are registered as trademarks in the united states and foreign countries 
these registrations can be renewed if the trademark remains in use 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  we may lose the competitive advantage provided by our intellectual property 
as a result  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  we may experience significant increases in the cost of labor or a disruption in our operations 
as of december   we had  employees  of which are employed in the united states  in canada and in the united kingdom 
approximately of our us workforce of our global workforce is represented by labor unions 
of our nine material collective bargaining agreements  one will expire in  five will expire in and three will expire in additionally  approximately of our workforce is employed in europe where trade union membership is common 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are good  as a result of general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  political and other factors beyond our control  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations 
we rely on independent distributors and the loss of a substantial number of these distributors may reduce our profits and sales 
in addition to our own direct sales force  we depend on the services of independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers 
in  of our sales  net of shipping and handling costs  were generated through these independent distributors 
many of these independent distributors are not bound to us by exclusive distribution contracts and may offer products of  and services to  businesses that compete with ours 
in addition  the majority of the distribution contracts we have with these independent distributors are cancelable by the distributor after providing us with notice  which on average is six months prior to termination 
the loss of a substantial number of these distributors or the decision by many of these distributors to offer competitors products to our customers could materially reduce our sales and profits 
if we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses  our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected 
our business strategy includes supplementing internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of small complementary businesses 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms  identify suitable businesses to acquire or successfully integrate acquired businesses in the future 
we compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other small complementary businesses 
this competition and regulatory considerations may result in fewer acquisition opportunities 
if we cannot complete acquisitions  our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
our business is dependent upon highly skilled personnel  and the loss of key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our development and results of operations 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managers and other personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business 
the loss of the services of key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our development and results of operations

our product lines include salt for highway deicing  consumer deicing  water conditioning  consumer and industrial food preparation  agriculture and industrial applications 
in addition  compass is north america s leading producer of sulfate of potash  which is used in the production of specialty fertilizers for high value crops and turf 
salt is indispensable and enormously versatile with more than  uses 
in addition  there is an absence of cost effective alternatives 
as a result  our cash flows are not materially impacted by economic cycles 
we are among the lowest cost salt producers in our markets because our salt deposits are high grade and among the most extensive in the world  and because we use effective mining techniques and efficient production processes 
our sop plant is the largest in north america and one of only two all natural solar sop plants in the western hemisphere 
our north american salt mines and sop production facility are near either water or rail transport systems  which minimizes our shipping and handling costs 
for the year ended december   we sold approximately million tons of salt  sulfate of potash and other minerals  generating sales of million and net income of million

management s discussion on critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventory allowances we record allowances for unrecoverable  unusable or slow moving finished goods and raw materials and supplies inventory 
we adjust the value of certain inventory to the estimated market value to the extent that management s assumptions of future demand  market or functional conditions indicate the cost basis is either in excess of market or the inventory will not be utilized or sold in future operations 
if actual demand or conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
mineral interests as of december   we maintained million of net mineral properties as a part of property  plant and equipment 
mineral interests include probable mineral reserves 
we lease mineral reserves at several of our extraction facilities 
these leases have varying terms and many provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific amount per ton of mineral extracted or as a percentage of revenue 
mineral interests in north america  approximately  net of amortization as of december   are amortized on a units of production method based on internal and third party estimates of recoverable reserves 
mineral interests in the uk are approximately  net of amortization as of december   and are amortized on a straight line basis 
our rights to extract minerals are contractually limited by time or lease boundaries 
if we are not able to continue to extend lease agreements  as we have in the past  at commercially reasonable terms  without incurring substantial costs or incurring material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions  the assigned lives may be less than that projected by management  or if the actual size  quality or recoverability of the minerals is less than that projected by management  then the rate of amortization could be increased or the value of the reserves could be reduced by a material amount 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we are required to assess the likelihood that we will ultimately be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider sources of taxable income including the reversal of existing temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for the assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the origination of future temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that a valuation allowance was required for a portion of our deferred tax assets that resulted from our us net operating loss nol 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k carryforwards 
as of december  we had million of deferred tax assets resulting from our prior year us nol carryforwards 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax assets relating to nols that it does not believe will  more likely than not  be realized 
at december   the valuation allowance was million 
the million reduction of the valuation allowance in was primarily due to the timing of future taxable income  exclusive of reversals of taxable temporary differences 
in the future  if the company determines  based on existence of sufficient evidence  that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made 
the actual amount of the deferred tax assets realized could ultimately be materially different from those recorded  as impacted by changes in income tax laws and actual operating results that differ from historical and forecasted amounts 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance to the extent the sources of taxable income are not sufficient to recover some of the deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
taxes on foreign earnings our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our results for the year ended december  do not reflect the impact of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
we have not completed the process of reevaluating our position with respect to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings to take into account the possible election of the repatriation provisions contained in the jobs act 
future foreign earnings remittance amounts may be completed based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 
at this time  we are unable to quantify the amount of future foreign earnings remittances  if any 
pension plans we make actuarial assumptions in conjunction with our actuaries as our advisors that we believe are reasonable 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases  and are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans 
if actual conditions or results vary from those projected by management  adjustments may be required in future periods to meet minimum pension funding  thereby increasing pension expense and our pension liability 
note to our audited consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding pension assumptions used by us 
we have two defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees in the united states and the united kingdom 
the size of the us plan is not significant as compared to the uk plan  taken as a whole 
the uk plan was closed to new participants in our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations 
cash contributions to the plans totaled and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  environmental accruals  financial instruments and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under re examination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
although no specific conclusions reached to date by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  future outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence

american jobs creation act of we maintain undistributed foreign earnings outside of the united states in canada and the united kingdom 
most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but  under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
we have not provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  since these foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  the jobs act  provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the us pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
we have not precisely quantified the amount of our foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary deduction but estimate this amount to be approximately million 
for us  the one year period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is the twelve month period ending february  we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate any foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and  if so  the amount that we will repatriate 
the range of reasonably possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation  which would be eligible for the temporary deduction  is zero to approximately million 
we are awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the jobs act prior to completing our analysis of applying the provisions of the act 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k to our particular situation and making a determination as to the amount we may repatriate  if any 
if our analysis determines that repatriation would be favorable and an appropriate domestic reinvestment plan can be established that is applicable to our business model  we would likely repatriate amounts in the mid to upper end of our range 
we expect to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  during use of the funds will be governed by a domestic reinvestment plan  as required by the jobs act 
repatriation of any amount eligible for the temporary deduction could result in additional us federal income tax expense during or as part of our evaluation process we will determine the potential income tax effects of any repatriation 
we have not determined the reasonable range of potential income tax effects at this time and expect an analysis to be completed during repatriation also could substantially increase liquidity in the us  although use of the additional liquidity would be restricted by the domestic reinvestment plan 
there would be a corresponding reduction in liquidity at our foreign subsidiaries 
some foreign subsidiaries could be required to borrow in order to repatriate their earnings to the us we expect our foreign cash flows would be sufficient to repay any foreign debt and replenish foreign cash balances over time 
should we decide not to repatriate foreign earnings under the jobs act  we would meet us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowing  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
sensitivity analysis related to ebitda in connection with the ipo  the secondary equity offerings and the recapitalization  we have incurred significant non recurring other charges that impact our results of operations 
as a result  our results of operations and cash flows are not indicative of what they would have been had we not incurred these non recurring charges

we believe that these non gaap measures can assist investors in understanding our cost structure  cash flows and financial position 
in addition  the financial covenants and ratios in our senior credit facilities and our indentures  such as restrictions on payments and indebtedness and ratios relating to leverage  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage  are also tied to measures that are calculated by adjusting ebitda as described below 
we believe it is necessary to adjust ebitda to enable investors to see how we view our business given the significant other charges that have historically affected our results of operations 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda are calculated under gaap and neither should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
while ebitda and adjusted ebitda and similar variations thereof are frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
the following is a summary of our other charges incurred for each of our last three fiscal years for the year ended december  in connection with two secondary offerings that occurred in july and november  we incurred and expensed certain non recurring costs totaling million 
in addition  apollo elected to terminate the amended management consulting agreement in november resulting in a final payment of million for all services rendered under the agreement 
for the year ended december  in connection with the ipo  we incurred and expensed certain non recurring costs totaling million that consisted of costs directly related to the ipo completed in december of for the year ended december  following the recapitalization  we incurred and expensed certain non recurring costs totaling million that consisted of transition costs required to establish us as an self sustaining entity 
the costs were directly related to the transition from an entity controlled by mosaic and consisted primarily of one time compensation costs  costs to develop stand alone tax and inventory strategies and costs associated with determining the post closing purchase price adjustment 
the adjustments to ebitda set forth in the table below include adjustments relating to the expenses and charges described above  which we believe are not likely to recur 
although these adjustments are not permitted as adjustments in preparing financial statements in accordance with regulation s x  management believes that the presentation of ebitda  as so adjusted  provides useful information in analyzing the effects of other charges  including those resulting from the ipo

we incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enter into either a purchase or sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant local currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our historical consolidated financial statements 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in us dollars  with pounds sterling and canadian dollars also being significant 
we generated of our sales in foreign currencies  and we incurred of our total operating expenses in foreign currencies 
the net depreciation of the pound sterling and canadian dollar against the us dollar and other world currencies during had a negative impact on our sales and adjusted ebitda  as reported in us dollars in our consolidated financial statements while the weakening us dollar against these currencies in and had a positive impact on our sales and adjusted ebitda

seasonality we experience a substantial amount of seasonality in salt sales 
the result of this seasonality is that sales and operating income are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower during the second and third quarters of each year

following industry practice in north america  we stockpile sufficient quantities of deicing salt in the second  third and fourth quarters to meet the estimated requirements for the winter season

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business is subject to various types of market risks that include  but are not limited to  interest rate risk  foreign currency translation risk and commodity pricing risk 
in the future  management may take actions that would mitigate our exposure to these types of risks including forward purchase contracts and financial instruments 
however  there can be no assurance that our hedging operations will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with these risks 
we will not enter into any financial instrument arrangements for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of december   we had million of debt outstanding under the term loan credit facility and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
both the term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility are subject to variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming no change in the term loan credit facility borrowings at december   and an average level of borrowings from our revolving credit facility at variable rates  and assuming a one hundred basis point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense for the year ended december  would have increased by approximately million 
actual changes will vary from hypothetical changes 
foreign currency risk we conduct our business primarily in the united kingdom and north america and export some products to europe and southeast asia 
our operations may  therefore  be subject to volatility because of currency fluctuations  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in these countries 
sales and expenses are frequently denominated in local currencies and results of operations may be affected adversely as currency fluctuations affect our product prices and operating costs or those of our competitors 
we may engage in hedging operations  including forward foreign exchange contracts  to reduce the exposure of our cash flows to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we will not engage in hedging for speculative investment reasons 
our historical results do not reflect any foreign exchange hedging activity 
there can be no assurance that our hedging operations will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating currencies 
see item  business risk factors economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business  including economic loss and a negative impact on earnings 
considering our currency expenses  a hypothetical unfavorable change in the exchange rates compared to the us dollar would have an estimated million impact on earnings for the year ended december  actual changes in market prices or rates will differ from hypothetical changes 
commodity pricing risk commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities we have reviewed various options to mitigate the impact of fluctuating natural gas prices 
during and  we instituted a hedging policy to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
the notional volumes hedged are based on a combination of factors including estimated natural gas usage  current market prices and historical market prices 
pursuant to our policy  we enter into contractual gas price swaps related to the purchase price of our natural gas requirements up to months in advance of the physical purchase of the natural gas and hedge up to approximately of our expected natural gas usage 
we have determined that these financial instruments qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  as amended 
the notional amount of natural gas swap derivative contracts outstanding at december  that expire in one year or less and expire greater than one year total million and million  respectively 
excluding gas hedged with derivative instruments  a hypothetical adverse change in our natural gas prices during the year ended december  would have had an estimated million impact on earnings 
actual results will vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates
