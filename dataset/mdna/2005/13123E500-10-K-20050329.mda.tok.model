these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements concerning the following our ability to compete effectively with our competitors  levels of future revenues  expected gross margins  future operating expenses  the impact of quarterly fluctuations of revenue and operating results  our expectations regarding third party service providers and strategic partners  future acquisitions  levels of capital expenditures  staffing and expense levels  the adequacy of our capital resources to fund operations and growth  our expectations regarding our executive hiring goals  and our expectations with respect to the impact of changes in our accounting for share based compensation 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause industry trends or our actual results  level of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  level of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements 
for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties  see the factors that could affect future results sections of this annual report on form k 
overview of results we are a leading provider of enterprise incentive management eim software systems to global companies across multiple industries 
large enterprises use eim systems to model  administer  analyze and report on incentive compensation  or pay for performance plans  which compensate employees and business partners for the achievement of targeted quantitative and qualitative objectives  such as sales quotas  product development milestones and customer satisfaction 
we sell our eim products both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our strategic partners pursuant to perpetual software licenses  and offer professional services  including configuration  integration and training  generally on a time and materials basis 
we also generate maintenance and support revenues associated with our product licenses  which are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
in  our total revenues decreased to million from million in this decline was the result of a reduction in license revenues  partially offset by a increase in maintenance and service revenues in compared to the adverse change in license revenues was driven by a variety of factors  including a lengthening of sales cycles  general weakness in our market and a trend toward smaller average transaction values 
as a result of this substantial decline in higher margin license revenues  as well as a million impairment charge described below  our overall gross margin declined to in  compared to in the prior year 
operating expenses increased  to million in compared to million in operating expenses in the first half of were million compared to million in the second half of the higher expenses in the first half of the year were the result of continued growth in our operations based on our expectation that license revenues would continue to increase from levels and a million impairment charge described below 
as a result of the decline in license revenues in the first half of the year  we undertook a restructuring action early in the third quarter that reduced our workforce by approximately and made additional reductions in discretionary spending 
the restructuring action resulted in a million charge in the third quarter of as a result of these actions we were able to substantially reduce our cost structure in the second half of compared to the first half of in june  in an effort to refocus our efforts on our core business and reduce expenses in light of the substantial decline in our license revenues  we discontinued our trueperformance product line  and recorded a million impairment charge against cost of revenues  representing the carrying value of the source code license we purchased in december for million 
we also recorded a million charge for impairment of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of an assembled workforce of approximately software developers we acquired in april for million to continue the development of the trueperformance product 

table of contents as a result of the significant reduction in license revenues  higher operating expenses and the trueperformance related charges discussed above  we incurred a net loss in of million  compared with net income of  in our future operating performance  including our ability to increase license revenues and return to profitability  is subject a number of risks and uncertainties 
in particular  the market for eim products is currently small  newly emerging  difficult to measure and did not achieve the growth we anticipated in increased sales of our products will depend on our ability to convince potential customers of the value we believe our products can deliver as compared to their legacy systems for managing incentive compensation 
if we are unable to convince potential customers of the value proposition of our products  and if our market does not improve  we may be unable to return to profitability or to levels of sales achieved in in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in factors that could affect future results 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  our use of estimates and the related disclosures with our audit committee 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily by licensing software and providing maintenance and professional services to our customers 
our software arrangements typically include i an end user license fee paid in exchange for the use of our products in perpetuity  generally based on a specified number of payees  and ii a maintenance arrangement that provides for technical support and product updates  generally over a period of twelve months 
if we are selected to provide integration and configuration services  then the software arrangement will also include professional services  generally priced on a time and materials basis 
depending upon the elements in the arrangement and the terms of the related agreement  we recognize license revenues under either the residual or the contract accounting method 
residual method 
license fees are recognized upon delivery when licenses are either sold separately from integration and configuration services  or together with integration and configuration services  provided that i the criteria described below have been met  ii payment of the license fees is not dependent upon performance of the integration and configuration services  and iii the services are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize these license revenues using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  revenues are recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered 
table of contents elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
each license arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each undelivered element 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for a certain class of transactions  the fair value of the maintenance portion of our arrangements is based on stated renewal rates rather than stand alone sales 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred until evidence of fair value can be established  or until the items for which evidence of fair value cannot be established are delivered 
if the only undelivered element is maintenance  then the entire amount of revenue is recognized over the maintenance delivery period 
contract accounting method 
for arrangements where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  such as where the payment of the license fees is dependent upon performance of the services  both the license and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we generally use the percentage of completion method because we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates relative to contract costs and the extent of progress toward completion 
however  if we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates  we use the completed contract method 
if total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated loss on the arrangement 
for all of our software arrangements  we will not recognize revenue until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we evaluate each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
we consider delivery to have occurred when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the recognition of revenue until cash collection 
a customer typically prepays maintenance for the first twelve months  and the related revenues are deferred and recognized over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
professional services revenues primarily consist of integration and configuration services related to the installation of our products and training revenues 
our implementation services do not involve customization to  or development of  the underlying software code 
substantially all of our professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis 
to the extent we enter into a fixed fee services contract  a loss will be recognized any time the total estimated project cost exceeds project revenues 

table of contents certain arrangements result in the payment of customer referral fees to third parties that resell our software products 
in these arrangements  license revenues are recorded  net of such referral fees  at the time the software license has been delivered to a third party reseller and an end user customer has been identified 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which is netted against accounts receivable on our balance sheets  totaled approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required and such provision may be material 
we generally guarantee that our services will be performed in accordance with the criteria agreed upon in the statement of work 
should these services not be performed in accordance with the agreed upon criteria  we would provide remediation services until such time as the criteria are met 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgments and make estimates of sales return reserves related to potential future requirements to provide remediation services in connection with current period service revenues 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues if for any period actual returns differ from management s judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balance  which is netted against our accounts receivable on our balance sheets  was approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  impairment of purchased technology and intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
in  as a result of a decline in financial performance  we assessed whether the purchased technology and other intangible assets acquired from cezanne software were impaired 
we compared the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
based on this assessment  we determined the asset group had no value and recorded an impairment charge of million as a cost of revenues and million as an operating expense 
the million impairment related to unamortized capitalized software costs 
the million impairment consisted of a million impairment to an assembled workforce intangible asset and an approximately  impairment of a favorable lease asset 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance  market conditions  and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
stock based compensation we have adopted sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  but in accordance with sfas  we have elected not to apply fair value based accounting for our employee stock option plans 
instead  we measure compensation expense for our employee stock option plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we record deferred stock based compensation to the extent the fair value of our common stock for financial accounting purposes exceeds the exercise price of stock options 
table of contents granted to employees on the date of grant  and amortize these amounts to expense using the accelerated method over the vesting schedule of the options  which is generally four years 
for options granted after our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock is the closing price on the date of grant 
for options which were granted prior to our initial public offering  the deemed fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors 
the board of directors determined the deemed fair value of our common stock by considering a number of factors  including  but not limited to  our operating performance  significant events in our history  issuances of our convertible preferred stock  trends in the broad market for technology stocks and the expected valuation to be obtained in an initial public offering 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of the stock options  materially different amounts of stock compensation expenses could have been reported 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  million and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on deferred stock based compensation recorded as of december   we expect to amortize million in the first half of fiscal for the second half of fiscal  we are still evaluating the impact of fasb statement no 
r  effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june   and we expect our stock based compensation expense will significantly increase 
please see our recent accounting pronouncements for additional discussion of fasb statement no 
r 
as required by sfas  as modified by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 we provide pro forma disclosure of the effect of using the fair value based method of measuring stock based compensation expense 
for purposes of the pro forma disclosure  we estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees using the black scholes option valuation model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and our expected stock price volatility 
therefore  the estimated fair value of our employee stock options could vary significantly as a result of changes in the assumptions used 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on from k 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  and while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the 
table of contents income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for us beginning in the quarter ending september  upon the adoption of fasb no 
r  we can elect to recognize stock based compensation related to employees equity awards in our consolidated statements of operations using fair value based method on a modified prospective basis and disclose the pro forma effect on net income or loss assuming the use of fair value based method in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the adoption 
since we currently account for equity awards granted to our employees using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 we expect the adoption of fasb no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue  cost of revenues and gross margin the table below sets forth the changes in revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit from fiscal to fiscal in thousands  except percentage data percentage of dollar year ended percentage year ended percentage year to year change december  of total december  of total increase year over revenue revenue decrease year revenue licenses maintenance and services total revenue percentage of related revenue percentag of related revenue e cost of revenues licenses maintenance and services impairment of purchase technology gross profit revenue license revenues 
license revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in average license value  fewer large dollar transactions being completed and a generally more challenging selling environment with longer selling cycles 
the average license revenue per transaction in fiscal was million compared to million per transaction in fiscal in fiscal  four customers accounted for transactions with million or more of license revenue compared to transactions in fiscal we attribute the decline in average license value and the decline in the number of large dollar transactions to a general weakness in our market 
in  we expect our license revenues to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter since we generally complete a relatively small number of transactions in a quarter and the prices on those software license sales can vary widely 
maintenance and service revenues 
maintenance and service revenues increased in fiscal due to growth of recurring maintenance revenues  an expansion of our professional services organization  increased utilization of our consultants and a higher average billing rate for our services as compared to fiscal our consultants are responsible for implementation  upgrades and other consulting services 
we do not intend to 
table of contents significantly expand our professional services organization in  but rather will increase our use of system integration partners for the implementation of our software products 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues decreased in fiscal primarily due to the lower level of license revenues in compared to additionally  in we recorded  of amortization expense from purchased technology related to our trueperformance product 
as a percentage of license revenue  cost of license revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the mix between fixed royalty fees compared to variable royalty fees in third party royalty costs in fiscal resulting from the lower average license value in fiscal we do not anticipate any changes to our third party technology agreements in accordingly  we expect to keep license gross margins at or above for cost of maintenance and service revenues 
cost of maintenance and service revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to million of higher personnel costs associated with a increase in headcount 
as a percentage of maintenance and service revenues  cost of maintenance and service revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to our higher average billing rates and an increase in the overall utilization of our services organization 
in the future  we expect to keep maintenance and service gross margins between and 
impairment of purchased technology 
we discontinued our trueperformance product in july based on our assessment of estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we determined the asset had no value 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our unamortized capitalized software costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in our gross margin is attributable primarily to the shift in revenue mix to lower margin maintenance and service revenues which represented of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of total revenues in fiscal in the future  we expect our gross margins to fluctuate depending on the mix of license versus maintenance and service revenues recorded 
operating expenses the table below sets forth the changes in operating expenses from fiscal to fiscal in thousands  except percentage data percentage of dollar year ended percentage year ended percentage year to year change december  of total december  of total increase year over revenue revenue decrease year operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative impairment of intangible asset restructuring expenses stock based compensation total operating expenses operating expenses 
operating expenses increased  to million in compared to million in operating expenses in the first half of were million compared to million in the second half of the higher expenses in the first half of the year were the result of continued growth in our operations based on our expectation that license revenues would continue to increase 
table of contents from levels and a million impairment charge 
as a result of the decline in license revenues in the first half of the year  we undertook a restructuring action early in the third quarter that reduced our workforce by approximately and made additional reductions in discretionary spending 
as a result of these actions we were able to substantially reduce our cost structure in the second half of compared to the first half of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal due primarily to a million decline in commission expense as a result of lower license revenue 
this decline was partially offset by a million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel of approximately employees 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of due to severance costs associated with the departure of our senior vice president  operations  recruiting costs for a new vice president of sales  and our annual sales conference 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses in included million of personnel costs and amortization expense related to our trueperformance development team in italy  which was shut down in the third quarter of  and a million increase of personnel costs associated with an increase in headcount of approximately employees to our united states research and development team 
the remainder of the fluctuation in research and development expenses between fiscal and fiscal resulted from other individually insignificant items 
we expect our research and development expenses to decrease in fiscal due to the termination of the trueperformance development team offset by a slight increase of united states headcount 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs associated with an increase in headcount of approximately employees and an million increase in professional fees associated with being a public company 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in primarily due to external audit and professional fees to document and test our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
impairment of intangible assets 
in connection with our decision to discontinue the trueperformance product  we recorded an impairment charge consisting of million related to the write off of the purchased assembled workforce and approximately  of a favorable lease in fiscal restructuring expenses 
during  we undertook a restructuring plan which included discontinuing our trueperformance product line and eliminating positions or of our workforce  including our trueperformance development team in italy 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in fiscal  most of which related to employee termination costs 
all restructuring costs were paid in stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense increased from fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in stock based compensation in fiscal was primarily related to a charge of million resulting from the modification of stock options associated with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer 
in the first half of  we expect stock based compensation to be approximately million  which includes a  charge in the first quarter of for the modification of stock options associated with the resignation of our senior vice president  operations 
in addition  beginning in the quarter ending september  we will be required to comply with the new accounting standard  fasb statement no 
r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement at the time of the grant based on their fair values 
we are in the process of assessing the impact this revised standard will have on our financial results 
we currently expect that the impact will be material

payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt  including current maturities operating leases total contractual cash obligations in  we had access to a revolving line of credit that permitted borrowings of up to million 
we did not make any borrowings under this line of credit 
the line of credit expires in march and will not be renewed 
the line of credit and outstanding loans require us to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements  with the exception of operating lease commitments that have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
other obligations include one letter of credit outstanding at december   totaling approximately  related to our san jose office 
we believe our existing cash balances and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated short and long term cash requirements as well as the contractual obligations listed above 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancement to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
factors that could affect future results we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this annual report on form k and in our other public filings 
we have a history of losses  and we cannot assure you that we will achieve and sustain profitability 
we incurred net losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and had net income of approximately  in fiscal while we have taken steps to reduce our expense levels to better track with our revenues we expect to incur a loss in fiscal and cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve and sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we cannot increase our quarterly license revenues  our future results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
we have recently experienced changes in our senior management team and the loss of other key personnel or any inability of these personnel to perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business 
we have recently engaged an executive search firm for purposes of hiring a permanent chief executive officer and are also in the process of hiring a new vice president of sales 
in june  reed d 
taussig  who had served as our president and chief executive officer since  resigned from callidus and its board of directors and david b 
pratt  who joined our board of directors in may  was appointed interim president and chief executive officer 
in september  daniel j 
welch  senior vice president of emea and general 
table of contents manager of trueperformance left the company and in february  christopher w 
cabrera  senior vice president  operations  also resigned 
in addition  other recent changes included promoting richard furino to vice president  client services in april our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to hire an effective chief executive officer and vice president of sales  to assimilate these changes in our leadership team and to retain the services of our executive officers  and other key employees 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executives or key employees  if we fail to successfully hire an effective chief executive officer and vice president of sales and assimilate these changes in our management team or if one or more of our executives or key employees decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could harm our business and could affect our ability to successfully implement our business plan 
our quarterly revenues and operating results can be difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially  which may harm our results of operations 
our revenues  particularly our license revenues  are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  in fiscal  our license revenues were substantially lower than expected due to delays in purchasing by our customers and failures to close transactions resulting in a net loss for the year 
factors that may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate include the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles and changes in their budgets for software and related purchases  competitive conditions in our industry  including new products  product announcements and special pricing offered by our competitors  our ability to hire  train and retain appropriate sales and professional services staff  customers concerns regarding sarbanes oxley section compliance and implementing large  enterprise wide deployments of our products  varying size  timing and contractual terms of orders for our products  which may delay the recognition of revenues  sales cycles strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  our ability to timely complete our service obligations related to product sales  general weakening of the economy resulting in a decrease in the overall demand for computer software and services  the utilization rate of our professional services personnel and the degree to which we use third party consulting services  changes in our pricing policies  timing of product development and new product initiatives  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to higher margin product license revenues as opposed to substantially lower margin service revenues 
in addition  we make assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenues in budgeting our future operating costs and capital expenditures 
specifically  our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of such transactions 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate our sales forecasts and then evaluate the forecasts to identify trends in our business 
although we have reduced our expenses for future quarters to better align our 
table of contents costs with expected revenues  our costs are relatively fixed in the short term and a substantial portion of our license revenue contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter 
as a result  failure to complete one or more license transactions at the end of a quarter would cause our quarterly results of operations to be worse than anticipated  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly license revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of transactions involving sales of our products to new customers  and any delay or failure in closing one or more of these transactions could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we are unable to substantially increase our license revenues  we many be unable to achieve and sustain profitability 
our quarterly license revenues are dependent upon a relatively small number of transactions involving sales of our products to new customers  and to date recurring license revenues from existing customers have not comprised a substantial part of our revenues 
as such  variations in the rate and timing of conversion of our sales prospects into revenues could result in our failure to meet revenue objectives in future periods  as has been the case in fiscal in addition  based upon the terms of our customer contracts  we recognize the bulk of our license revenues for a given sale either at the time we enter into the agreement and deliver the product  or over the period in which we perform any services that are essential to the functionality of the product 
unexpected changes in the size of transactions or other contractual terms late in the negotiation process or changes in the mix of contracts we enter into could therefore materially and adversely affect our license revenues in a quarter 
delays or reductions in the amount of customers purchases would adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 
our stock price is likely to remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed in this risk factors section of this annual report on form k and others such as our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  changes in our management team  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  terrorist acts  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  results of operations  projections  new technologies  acquisitions  commercial relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments 
for example  following our preliminary announcement of anticipated quarterly revenues and operating results in march  and the resignation of our chief executive officer and our announcement regarding operating results for the quarter ended june   our stock price declined dramatically 
any further adverse announcement about our business or adverse developments in our market  or the economy generally could cause our stock price to decline further 

table of contents our products have long sales cycles  which make it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results 
the sales cycles for our products have historically been between six and twelve months for the majority of our sales  and in some cases have taken longer 
in addition  we have recently been experiencing lengthening of our selling cycles 
it is therefore difficult to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will occur and to plan our expenditures accordingly 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and its purchase of our products and services is relatively long due to several factors  including the complex nature of our products  the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products  the requirement that a potential customer invest significant resources in connection with the purchase and implementation of our products  budget cycles of our potential customers that affect the timing of purchases  customer requirements for competitive evaluation and internal approval before purchasing our products  potential delays of purchases due to announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors  and the lengthy approval processes of our potential customers  many of which are large organizations 
the delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter would reduce our revenues in that quarter  as well as any subsequent quarters over which revenues for the sale would likely be recognized 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large orders  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenues 
if we continue to experience delays on one or more large orders  as we have in fiscal  our operating results will continue to be adversely affected 
if we are unable to increase sales of new product licenses  our maintenance and service revenues will be materially and adversely affected 
while we experienced a sharp decline in license revenues in fiscal  our maintenance and service revenues were largely in line with our expectations 
a substantial portion of our maintenance and services revenues are derived from providing professional integration and configuration services associated with product licenses sold in prior periods 
as such  if we are unable to increase sales of our product licenses  our services revenue will decline as well 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations  including sarbanes oxley act of  requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
our maintenance and service revenues produce substantially lower gross margins than our license revenues  and decreases in license revenues relative to service revenues have harmed  and may continue to harm  our overall gross margins 
our maintenance and service revenues  which include fees for consulting  implementation  maintenance and training  were  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our maintenance and service revenues have substantially lower gross margins than our license revenues 
the decrease in the percentage of total revenues represented by license revenues in fiscal as compared to 
table of contents fiscal adversely affected our overall gross margins and contributed to a net loss for the year 
failure to increase our higher margin license revenues in the future would again adversely affect our gross margin and operating results 
maintenance and service revenues as a percentage of total revenues have varied significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in licensing revenues  economic changes  change in the average selling prices for our products and services  our customers acceptance of our products and our sales force execution 
in addition  the volume and profitability of services can depend in large part upon competitive pricing pressure on the rates that we can charge for our professional services  the complexity of the customers information technology environment  the resources directed by customers to their implementation projects  and the extent to which outside consulting organizations provide services directly to customers 
we expect maintenance and services revenue to continue to make up a substantial majority of our overall revenues for the foreseeable future and any erosion of our margins for our maintenance and service revenues would adversely affect our operating results 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations  including sarbanes oxley act of  requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
managing large scale deployments of our products requires substantial technical implementation and support by us or third party service providers 
failure to meet these requirements could cause a decline or delay in recognition of our revenues and an increase in our expenses 
our customers may require large  enterprise wide deployments of our products  which require a substantial degree of technical implementation and support 
it may be difficult for us to manage the timeliness of these deployments and the allocation of personnel and resources by us or our customers 
failure to successfully manage this process could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing customers  face potential customer disputes or limit the number of new customers that purchase our products  which could adversely affect our revenues and increase our technical support and litigation costs 
our software license customers have the option to receive implementation  maintenance  training and consulting services from our internal professional services organization or from outside consulting organizations 
in the future  we may be required to increase our use of third party service providers to help meet our implementation and service obligations 
if we require a greater number of third party service providers than we currently have available  we will be required to negotiate additional arrangements  which may result in lower gross margins for maintenance or service revenues 
if a customer selects a third party implementation service provider and such implementation services are not provided successfully and in a timely manner  our customers may experience increased costs and errors  which may result in customer dissatisfaction and costly remediation and litigation  any of which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and enhance our existing products 
failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products to the market may adversely affect our operating results 
the enterprise application software market is characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware and software development  evolving standards in computer hardware  software technology and communications infrastructure  changing customer needs  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
to keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance  we must enhance and improve existing products and we must also continue to introduce new products and services 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results 
further  any new products we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
for example  we introduced our trueperformance product in the first quarter of and discontinued this product in june due to an effort to focus our efforts on our core business and reduce expenses in light of the substantial declines in our license revenues 
in connection with the discontinuation of the trueperformance product line  we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately million in the third quarter of if we are unable to successfully develop new products or enhance and improve our existing products or if we fail to position and or price our products to meet market demand  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
a substantial majority of our revenues are derived from truecomp and related products and services and a decline in sales of these products and services could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from truecomp and related products and services  and revenues from these products and services are expected to continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
because we generally sell licenses to our products on a perpetual basis and deliver new versions and enhancements to customers who purchase maintenance contracts  our future license revenues are substantially dependent on sales to new customers 
in addition  substantially all of our trueinformation product sales have historically been made in connection with truecomp sales 
as a result of these factors  we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for truecomp 
accordingly  if demand for truecomp and related products and services declines significantly  our business and operating results will  as was in the case in  be adversely affected 
errors in our products could affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products 
our products are complex and  accordingly  they may contain errors  or bugs  that could be detected at any point in their product life cycle 
errors in our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products in the future 
customers relying on our products to calculate and pay incentive compensation may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products in general 
the costs incurred in correcting any product errors may be substantial and would adversely affect our operating margins 
while we plan to continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services organization to identify and correct bugs  errors in our products may be found in the future 

table of contents because our customers depend on our software for their critical business functions  any interruptions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  product liability suits against us  lost sales revenues  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  and increased service and warranty costs 
while our software license agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages for errors in our software  such limitations and disclaimers may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from such claims 
if we do not compete effectively with companies selling eim software  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense competition from a number of software companies 
we compete principally with vendors of eim software  enterprise resource planning software  and customer relationship management software 
our competitors may announce new products  services or enhancements that better meet the needs of customers or changing industry standards 
increased competition may cause price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our enterprise resource planning competitors and other potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  service and other resources than we have 
many of these companies also have a larger installed base of users  longer operating histories or greater name recognition than we have 
some of our competitors products may also be more effective than our products at performing particular eim system functions or may be more customized for particular customer needs in a given market 
even if our competitors provide products with more limited eim system functionality than our products  these products may incorporate other capabilities  such as recording and accounting for transactions  customer orders or inventory management data 
a product that performs these functions  as well as some of the functions of our software solutions  may be appealing to some customers because it would reduce the number of different types of software used to run their business 
further  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to changes in customer requirements 
our products must be integrated with software provided by a number of our existing or potential competitors 
these competitors could alter their products in ways that inhibit integration with our products  or they could deny or delay access by us to advance software releases  which would restrict our ability to adapt our products to facilitate integration with these new releases and could result in lost sales opportunities 
if we are required to change our pricing models to compete successfully  our margins and operating results will be adversely affected 
the intensely competitive market in which we do business may require us to reduce our prices 
if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services in an effort gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products  we may be required to lower prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully 
any such changes would be likely to reduce our margins and could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our competitors may bundle software products that compete with ours for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations 
these practices could  over time  limit the prices that we can charge for our products 
if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending  then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices would adversely affect our margins and operating results 

table of contents potential customers that outsource their technology projects offshore may come to expect lower rates for professional services than we are able to provide profitably  which could impair our ability to win customers and achieve profitability 
many of our potential customers have begun to outsource technology projects offshore to take advantage of lower labor costs  and we believe that this trend will continue 
due to the lower labor costs in some countries  these customers may demand lower hourly rates for the professional services we provide  which may erode our margins for our maintenance and service revenues or result in lost business 
we will not be able to achieve or sustain sales growth if we do not retain qualified sales personnel 
we depend on our direct sales force for most of our sales and have made significant expenditures in past periods to expand our sales force 
despite our efforts to expand our sales force  however  we have also experienced sales force attrition 
for example  our head of sales  resigned effective february  while it is our goal to hire and retain qualified replacements  we face intense competition for sales personnel in the software industry  and cannot be sure that we will be successful in hiring a new vice president of sales or retaining key sales individuals in accordance with our plans 
if we fail to successfully maintain a strong sales force  our future sales will be adversely affected 
we may lose sales opportunities and our business may be harmed if we do not successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships to implement and sell our products 
we have relationships with third party consulting firms  systems integrators and software vendors 
these third parties may provide us with customer referrals  cooperate with us in marketing our products and provide our customers with systems implementation services or overall program management 
however  we do not have formal agreements governing our ongoing relationship with certain of these third party providers and the agreements we do have generally do not include obligations with respect to generating sales opportunities or cooperating on future business 
should any of these third parties go out of business or choose not to work with us  we may be forced to increase the development of those capabilities internally  incurring significant expense and adversely affecting our operating margins 
any of our third party providers may offer products of other companies  including products that compete with our products 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties or they choose not to work with us 
acquisitions and investments present many risks  and we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 
we may in the future acquire or make investments in other complementary companies  products  services and technologies 
such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks  including as was the case with our acquisition of an assembled workforce and source code license from cezanne software  we may find that the acquired business or assets do not further our business strategy  or that we overpaid for the business or assets  or that economic conditions change  all of which may generate a future impairment charge  we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business  we may have difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines  there may be customer confusion where our products overlap with those of the acquired business  we may have product liability associated with the sale of the acquired business products  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations  
table of contents we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties  and we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality  technology and legal contingencies 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time 
from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as out of pocket expenses 
the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial condition and operating results 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate such acquisitions 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  including options or other rights  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs such as of acquired in process research and development costs and restructuring charges 
they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests  which could result in future impairment charges 
for instance  in december  we purchased a non exclusive license to copy  create  modify  and enhance the source code for our trueperformance product  and in may  we acquired a part of the development team of cezanne software in order to continue the development of the trueperformance product 
however  given our lower revenue projections and our plan to lower expenses  we made the decision to discontinue the trueperformance product in june of and recorded a total impairment of intangible assets charge of million as well as restructuring charges of approximately million 
for our business to succeed  we need to attract  train and retain qualified employees and manage our employee base effectively 
failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends on our ability to hire  train and retain qualified employees and to manage our employee base effectively 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters is located  and the high cost of living increases our recruiting and compensation costs 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring  training or retaining qualified personnel 
if we are unable to do so  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and additional lawsuits may be filed 
in july  a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current directors and officers  by or on behalf of persons claiming to be our shareholders and persons claiming to have purchased or otherwise acquired our securities during the period from november  through june  in addition  in each of july and october derivative lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our current directors and officers 
in february  the parties stipulated to a stay of the state derivative case in favor of the federal derivative case 
in february  the company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint 
the court has scheduled a hearing on the company s motion for may  additional lawsuits may be filed against us in the future 
we currently have director and officer insurance to cover claims that may arise in connection with these lawsuits and we believe that the claims are without merit 
however  in the event of an adverse result in one of these cases  the company s insurance may not be sufficient to satisfy a damage award and thus such an adverse result could have a material negative financial impact on the company 
regardless of the outcome of any of these actions  however  it is likely that such actions will cause a diversion of our management s time and attention 

table of contents if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced revenues and incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed programs may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
to the extent that we engage in international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will increase 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants and with the customers and corporations with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or one that results in a significant damage award 
from time to time  we receive claims that our products or business infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of third parties 
our competitors or other third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights 
we believe that software developers will be increasingly subject to claims of infringement as the functionality of products in our market overlaps 
a claim may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties 
if we were subject to a claim of infringement  regardless of the merit of the claim or our defenses  the claim could require costly litigation to resolve  absorb significant management time  cause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements  require us to discontinue the sale of our products  require us to indemnify our customers or third party systems integrators  or require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products 
we may also be required to indemnify our customers and third party systems integrators for third party products that are incorporated into our products and that infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
although many of these third parties are obligated to indemnify us if their products infringe the rights of others  this indemnification may not be adequate 
in addition  from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products 
we use a limited amount of open source software in our products and may use more open source software in the future 
as a result  we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software 
any of this litigation could be costly for us to defend  have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products 

table of contents we depend on technology of third parties licensed to us for our rules engine and the analytics and web viewer functionality for our products and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses or errors in such software could result in increased costs or delayed sales of our products 
we license technology from several software providers for our rules engine  analytics and web viewer 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
some of the products we license from third parties could be difficult to replace  and implementing new software with our products could require six months or more of design and engineering work 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in the license of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is developed or identified  licensed and integrated 
in addition  our products depend upon the successful operation of third party products in conjunction with our products  and therefore any undetected errors in these products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions and or injure our reputation 
our use of additional or alternative third party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties  which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation 
our revenues might be harmed by resistance to adoption of our software by information technology departments 
some potential customers may have already made a substantial investment in other third party or internally developed software designed to model  administer  analyze and report on pay for performance programs 
these companies may be reluctant to abandon these investments in favor of our software 
in addition  information technology departments of potential customers may resist purchasing our software solutions for a variety of other reasons  particularly the potential displacement of their historical role in creating and running software and concerns that packaged software products are not sufficiently customizable for their enterprises 
if the market for our products does not grow for any of these reasons  our revenues may be harmed 
mergers of or other strategic transactions by our competitors could weaken our competitive position or reduce our revenues 
if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors  the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future systems integrators  third party compensation consulting firms or other parties with whom we have relationships  thereby limiting our ability to promote our products and limiting the number of consultants available to implement our software 
disruptions in our business caused by these events could reduce our revenues 
we may expand our international operations but do not have substantial experience in international markets  and may not achieve the expected results 
we may in the future expand our international operations 
any international expansion would require substantial financial resources and a significant amount of attention from our management 
international operations involve a variety of risks  particularly unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  taxes  trade laws and tariffs  differing ability to protect our intellectual property rights  differing labor regulations  greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  
table of contents greater difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing foreign operations  and fluctuating exchange rates 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our products and services abroad 
if we invest substantial time and resources in order to grow our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
natural disasters or other incidents may disrupt our business 
our business communications  infrastructure and facilities are vulnerable to damage from human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss and other utility failures  fire  earthquake  flood  sabotage  vandalism and similar events 
although the source code for our software products is held by escrow agents outside of the san francisco bay area  our internal use software and back up are both located in the san francisco bay area 
if a natural or man made disaster were to hit this area  we may lose all of our internal use software data 
despite precautions  a natural disaster or other incident could result in interruptions in our service or significant damage to our infrastructure 
in addition  failure of any of our telecommunications providers could result in interruptions in our services and disruption of our business operations 
any of the foregoing could impact our provision of services and fulfillment of product orders  and our ability to process product orders and invoices and otherwise timely conduct our business operations 
our current officers  directors and entities affiliated with us may be able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
our current officers  directors and entities affiliated with us together beneficially owned a significant portion of the outstanding shares of common stock as of december  as a result  if some of these persons or entities act together  they have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors  amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination 
this may delay or prevent an acquisition or cause the market price of our stock to decline 
some of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours 
provisions in our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms  which means that replacing a majority of our directors would require at least two annual meetings 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting  and would not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which would require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
in addition  we are a party to a stockholder rights agreement  which effectively prohibits person from acquiring more than subject to certain exceptions of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
furthermore  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
all of these factors make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer that it did not believe was in our strategic interests 
if an acquirer is discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these or other measures  you could lose the opportunity to sell your shares at a favorable price 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  high quality corporate debt obligations or united states government obligations 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices  with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  that typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately seven months and all investment securities had maturities of less than twenty four months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity total total year more than principal fair or less year amount value available for sales securities weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
we had a revolving line of credit that expired in march for borrowings up to million and outstanding term loans with variable interest rates based on the lender s prime rate and prime rate plus  respectively 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to these debt instruments 
due to our outstanding debt balance of million as of december   we do not believe that any change in the prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our united kingdom  german and australian operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from our international operations 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we expect to continue to do a majority of our business in united states dollars 
we have not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe our foreign currency exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk
