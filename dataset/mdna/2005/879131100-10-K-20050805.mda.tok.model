item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the operating performance and financial condition of tektronix 
a discussion of our business  including our strategy  products and competition is included in part i of this form k 
tektronix develops  manufactures  markets and services test  measurement and monitoring solutions to a wide variety of customers in many industries  including computing  communications  semiconductors  education  government  military aerospace  research  automotive and consumer electronics 
unless otherwise indicated by the context  the terms tektronix  we  us or our refer to tektronix as the parent company and its majority owned subsidiaries 
we enable our customers to design  manufacture  deploy  monitor and service next generation global communications networks  computing  pervasive and advanced technologies 
revenue is derived principally through the development  manufacturing  marketing and selling of a broad range of products including oscilloscopes  logic analyzers  signal sources  spectrum analyzers  communication test equipment  including network management and diagnostics  and video test equipment  and related components  support services and accessories 
we maintain operations in four major geographies the americas  including the united states and 
table of contents other americas  which includes mexico  canada and south america  europe  which includes europe  russia  the middle east and africa  the pacific  which includes china  india  korea  and singapore  and japan 
tektronix results of operations and financial condition may be affected by a variety of factors 
in our opinion  the most significant of these factors include the economic strength of the technology markets into which we sell our products  our ability to develop compelling technology solutions and deliver these to the marketplace in a timely manner  and the actions of competitors 
the markets that we serve are very diverse and include a cross section of the technology industries 
accordingly  our business is cyclical and tends to correlate to the overall performance of the technology sector 
during the latter part of fiscal year  we began to experience the stabilization of certain markets that had been depressed in the previous year 
fiscal year saw a more broad based recovery in the technology sector from the downturn of preceding years 
during fiscal year  growth rates moderated as compared with the prior year  which management has partially attributed to pent up demand in fiscal year resulting from customers deferring purchasing activity during the downturn years of to during fiscal years and  we engaged in a variety of efforts to reduce our cost structure to better align with the lower sales levels 
the related business realignment costs continued to be incurred into fiscal year and to a lesser extent into fiscal year as many of the actions identified took considerable time to execute 
in addition to incurring costs to realign our cost structure during fiscal years and  we also incurred costs to restructure the operations of the japan subsidiary acquired through redemption of sony tektronix corporation and also recognized certain costs and credits directly associated with the integration of this subsidiary 
business realignment costs incurred during fiscal year largely related to previously planned actions in europe 
we face significant competition in many of the markets in which we sell our products 
tektronix competes on many factors including product performance  technology  product availability and price 
to compete effectively  we must deliver compelling products to the market in a timely manner 
accordingly  we make significant investments into the research and development of new products and the sales channels necessary to deliver products to the market 
even during periods where economic conditions have reduced our revenues  such as those experienced in fiscal years and  we continued to invest significantly in the development of new products and sales channels 
a discussion of our products and competitors is included in item business of this form k 
a component of our strategy includes focusing investments in certain product categories to expand our existing market positions 
expansion in these certain product categories may come through internal growth or from acquisitions 
on september   tektronix acquired inet technologies  inc inet  a company that engaged primarily in network monitoring 
the acquisition of inet has further expanded our network management and diagnostics product offerings 
the acquisition of inet is described below in this management s discussion and analysis 
for a discussion of risk factors affecting tektronix  see the risks and uncertainties section below 
acquisitions inet technologies  inc during the second quarter of fiscal year  tektronix acquired inet technologies  inc inet  a leading global provider of communications software solutions that enable network operators to more strategically and profitably operate their businesses 
inet s products address next generation mobile and fixed networks  including mobile data and voice over packet also referred to as voice over internet protocol or voip technologies  and traditional networks 
inet s unified assurance solutions enable network operators to simultaneously manage their voice and data services at the network  service  and customer layers by capturing  correlating  and analyzing network wide traffic in real time 
inet s diagnostic products assist equipment manufacturers and network operators to quickly and cost effectively design  deploy  and maintain current and next generation networks and network elements 
inet had approximately employees worldwide and had 
table of contents sales of million for the year ended december  through this acquisition tektronix significantly enhances its position in the overall network management and diagnostic market and will accelerate the delivery of products and solutions for network operators and equipment manufacturers seeking to implement next generation technologies such as general packet radio service gprs  universal mobile telecommunications systems umts and voip 
tektronix acquired all of inet s outstanding common stock for per share consisting of per share in cash and per share in tektronix common stock 
prior to the close of the transaction on september   inet had million shares of common stock outstanding 
the final exchange ratio used to determine the number of shares of tektronix common stock issued was  which resulted in the issuance of million shares of tektronix common stock in the transaction 
the million shares were valued at per share  based on the day period ended september   because that was the earliest date that the final exchange ratio could be determined 
the fair values of the stock options and restricted share rights assumed were determined by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the cash consideration of million  the value of tektronix common stock of million  and the fair values of stock options and restricted share rights assumed are included in the purchase price that was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
analysis supporting the purchase price allocation includes a valuation of assets and liabilities as of the closing date  including a third party valuation of intangible items and a detailed review of the opening balance sheet to determine other significant adjustments required to recognize assets and liabilities at fair value 
the purchase price allocation is subject to further changes  including resolution of tax contingencies associated with ongoing tax audits for pre acquisition periods 
the purchase price and resulting allocation to the underlying assets acquired  net of deferred income taxes  were as follows as of may  the following table presents the total purchase price in thousands cash paid stock issued stock options assumed restricted share rights assumed transaction costs unearned stock based compensation liabilities assumed total purchase price the following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired  net of deferred income taxes  based on their fair values in thousands cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories tax benefit from transaction costs other current assets property  plant  and equipment intangible assets goodwill other long term assets in process research and development deferred income taxes total assets acquired  net of deferred income taxes

this write off was included in acquisition related costs credits and amortization  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of ipr d was based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of ipr d included a risk adjusted discount rate of  revenue and expense projections  development life cycle and future entry of products to the market 
as of the acquisition date  there were eight research and development projects in process that were approximately complete 
the total estimated cost to complete these projects was approximately million at the acquisition date 
as of may   the total estimated remaining cost for these substantially complete projects was not significant

sony tektronix redemption prior to september   tektronix and sony corporation sony were equal owners of sony tektronix corporation sony tektronix  a joint venture originally established to distribute tektronix products in japan 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we acquired from sony its interest in sony tektronix through redemption of sony s shares by sony tektronix for billion yen  or approximately million at september  this transaction closed on september   at which time we obtained ownership of sony tektronix 
subsequent to the close of this transaction  this subsidiary is referred to as tektronix japan within this management s discussion and analysis 
this transaction is a long term strategic investment that is providing tektronix with stronger access to the japanese market and the ability to leverage the engineering resources in japan 
prior to the redemption  we accounted for our investment in sony tektronix under the equity method 
prior to the close of this transaction  the sony tektronix entity entered into an agreement to borrow up to billion yen  or approximately million at an interest rate of above the tokyo inter bank offering rate tibor 
sony tektronix used million of this credit facility to fund a portion of the redemption of shares from sony and the remainder was available for operating capital for tektronix japan 
the transaction was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting see note  and accordingly  beginning on the date of acquisition  the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of tektronix japan were consolidated in tektronix financial statements 
pro forma summary results of operations of tektronix after intercompany eliminations of the newly created japan subsidiary as though the redemption had been completed at the beginning of fiscal year were as follows in thousands  except per share amounts net sales net earnings from continuing operations earnings per share continuing operations basic and diluted 
table of contents the pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the redemption been consummated as of that time  nor is it intended to be a projection of future results 
during fiscal year  we incurred million in costs specifically associated with integrating the operations of this subsidiary  which were largely due to voluntary retention bonuses that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as discussed below 
these costs are included in acquisition related costs credits and amortization  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal year  we incurred million in costs specifically associated with integrating the operations of this subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we offered voluntary retention bonuses to certain employees in gotemba  japan as an incentive to remain with tektronix through august while we complete our plan to transition manufacturing operations to other locations 
accordingly  we recognized a liability for retention bonuses for employees of approximately million ratably through august during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recognized an expense of million for the retention bonuses which are included in acquisition related costs credits and amortization  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal year  subsequent to the close of the acquisition  we incurred million in transition costs associated with integrating the operations of this subsidiary 
these costs are included in acquisition related costs credits and amortization  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
we also incurred severance costs of million during fiscal year in japan which are discussed further in the business realignment costs section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal year  we restructured the japan pension plans see note and recorded a net gain from the restructuring of million 
also in fiscal year  we sold property located in shinagawa  japan  which resulted in a net gain of million  and we recognized an impairment loss of million on assets held for sale located in gotemba  japan 
these net gains and losses are included in acquisition related costs credits and amortization  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
after the sale of the property in shinagawa  japan described above  we repaid billion yen or approximately million of the outstanding principal on the tibor debt facility in fiscal year this facility was terminated on may  business realignment costs business realignment costs represent actions to realign our cost structure in response to significant events and primarily include restructuring actions and impairment of assets resulting from reduced business levels 
business realignment actions taken during fiscal years  and were intended to reduce our worldwide cost structure across all major functions in response to the dramatic economic decline  which severely impacted markets into which we sell our products 
major operations impacted include manufacturing  engineering  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
in addition to severance  we incurred other costs associated with restructuring our organization  which primarily represented facilities contracts and other exit costs associated with aligning the cost structure to appropriate levels 
actions taken have or are expected to result in reduced operating costs in periods following the period in which the costs were incurred  primarily through reductions in labor costs 
we believe that the restructuring actions implemented in fiscal years  and have resulted in the cost savings anticipated for those actions 
costs incurred during fiscal year primarily related to restructuring actions we planned in prior years which were executed in fiscal year many of the restructuring actions planned take significant time to execute  particularly if they are being conducted in countries outside the united states 
business realignment costs of million during fiscal year were primarily for severance and related costs for residual activity in europe 
for fiscal year  business realignment costs of million included severance and related costs of million for employees  million for contractual obligations  and million for accelerated depreciation of assets  offset by a million credit from net accumulated currency translation gains 
expected future annual salary cost savings from actions taken in fiscal year to reduce employee headcount is not significant 
at may   remaining liabilities of million for 
table of contents employee severance and related benefits for actions taken in fiscal years  and were maintained for employees 
the remaining million liability is for continuing payments on contractual obligations  some of which span several years 
business realignment costs of million in fiscal year included million of severance related costs for employees mostly located in europe and the united states and adjustments to estimates in prior years  million for accumulated currency translation losses  net  related to the substantial closure of subsidiaries in brazil  australia  denmark and a surplus facility in china  million for contractual obligations for leased facilities in europe and the united states  and million for accelerated depreciation and write down of assets in europe and the united states 
annual salary cost savings from actions taken in fiscal year to reduce employee headcount were estimated to be million 
business realignment costs of million in fiscal year were for employee severance  impairment of an intangible asset  a facility lease obligation and closure of other facilities 
we incurred million of severance and related costs for the termination of employees resulting from actions to align our cost structure with the reduced sales levels resulting from economic conditions discussed above  actions taken to align the cost structure of tektronix japan and adjustments to estimates in prior years 
these severance costs included million for employees of tektronix japan and million for pension curtailment and settlement losses for the employees terminated in japan 
an impairment charge of million was recognized to write down an intangible asset for acquired bluetooth technology 
the closure of certain foreign and domestic operations resulted in credits totaling million for accumulated translation gains and million primarily for other asset write downs and contractual obligations 
we reversed million for a facility lease obligation due to the sale of our optical transmission test product line in the second quarter of fiscal year we accrued million during fiscal year associated with the exiting of facilities previously utilized for optical transmission test 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information and tabular disclosure of business realignment costs 
critical accounting estimates we have identified the critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to our portrayal of the financial condition and operating results and require difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses include revenue recognition  contingencies  intangible asset valuation  pension plan assumptions and the assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the majority of our products are sold in this manner 
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped under fob shipping point shipping terms 
upon shipment  we also provide for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and sales returns 
when other significant obligations or acceptance terms remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled or acceptance by the customer has occurred 
contracts for our network monitoring solution products  which were acquired in the inet acquisition  often involve multiple deliverables 
revenues from inet products were million in fiscal year we determine the fair value of each of the contract deliverables using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
vsoe for each element of the contract is based on the price for which we sell the element on a stand alone basis 
in addition to hardware and software products  elements of the contracts include product support services  such as the correction of software problems  hardware replacement  telephone access to our technical personnel and the right to receive unspecified product updates  upgrades and enhancements  when and if they become available 
revenues from these services  including post contract support included in initial licensing fees  are recognized ratably over the service periods 
post contract support included in the initial licensing fee is allocated from the total contract amount based on the fair value of these services determined using vsoe 

table of contents if we determine that we do not have vsoe on an undelivered element of an arrangement  we will not recognize revenue until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
this occurrence could materially impact our financial results because of the significant dollar amount of many of our contracts and the significant portion of total revenues that a single contract may represent in any particular period 
revenue earned from service is recognized ratably over the contractual service periods or as the services are performed 
shipping and handling costs are recorded as cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
amounts billed or collected in advance of the period in which the related product or service qualifies for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies we are subject to claims and litigation concerning intellectual property  environmental and employment issues  and settlement of contingencies related to prior dispositions of assets 
accruals have been established based upon our best estimate of the ultimate outcome of these matters 
we review the status of any claims  litigation and other contingencies on a regular basis  and adjustments are made as additional information becomes available 
as of may   million of contingencies were recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  which included million of contingencies relating to the sale of the color printing and imaging division cpid described below  million for environmental exposures and million for other contingent liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that our estimates of contingencies could change in the near term and that such changes could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the sale of cpid on january   we deferred the recognition of million of gain on the sale and recorded contingencies of million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  our policy is to defer recognition of a gain where we believe contingencies exist which may result in that gain being recognized prior to realization 
we analyze the amount of deferred gain in relation to outstanding contingencies and recognize additional gain when objective evidence indicates that such contingencies are believed to be resolved 
the million of contingencies represented the deferral of a portion of the gain on sale that we believed was not realizable due to certain contingencies contained in the final sale agreement 
of the original million of contingencies  million has been utilized to settle claims and million was recognized in subsequent periods  including million in the third quarter of fiscal year as of may  and may   the balance of the contingencies related to the cpid disposition was million and million  respectively 
the remaining portion may take several years to resolve 
we continue to monitor the status of the cpid related contingencies based on information received 
included in contingent liabilities was million specifically associated with the closure and cleanup of a licensed hazardous waste management facility at our beaverton  oregon  campus 
the initial liability was established in  and we base ongoing estimates on currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations 
costs for tank removal and cleanup were incurred in fiscal year costs currently being incurred primarily relate to ongoing monitoring and testing of the site 
our best estimate of the range of remaining reasonably possible cost associated with this environmental cleanup  testing and monitoring could be as high as million 
we believe that the recorded liability represents the low end of a reasonable range of estimated liability associated with these environmental issues 
these costs are expected to be incurred over 
table of contents the next several years 
if events or circumstances arise that are unforeseen to us as of the balance sheet date  actual costs could differ materially from the recorded liability 
a preliminary risk investigation and feasibility study are expected to be completed in the second half of fiscal year which may have a significant impact on our estimate 
the remaining million of contingency accruals included amounts primarily related to intellectual property and employment issues  as well as contingencies related to dispositions of assets other than cpid 
if events or circumstances arise that we did not foresee as of the balance sheet date  actual costs could differ materially from the above described estimates of contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but we amortize other acquisition related intangibles with definite useful lives 
during fiscal year the inet acquisition increased goodwill by million 
as of may   the balance of goodwill  net was million  which was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal year and identified no impairment 
the impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for the reporting units as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if we fail to deliver new products for these reporting units  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
as of may   we had million of non goodwill intangible assets recorded in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets  which includes intangible assets from the acquisition of inet  acquired patent intangibles and licenses for certain technology 
for intangible assets with definite useful lives that are not software related  we amortize the cost over the estimated useful lives and assess any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  we may incur charges to impair these assets 
the impairment would be based on the estimated discounted cash flow associated with each asset 
impairment could result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  we fail to deliver new products related to these technology assets  the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
for software related intangible assets with definite useful lives  we amortize the cost over the estimated economic life of the software product and assess impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized cost of the software related intangible asset is compared to its net realizable value 
the net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from the software product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product  including the costs of performing maintenance and customer support 
the excess of the unamortized cost over the net realizable value would then be recognized as an impairment loss 
amortization expense for intangible assets that are software related developed technology is recorded as cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations
