item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents purchasing we purchase most of the food products and packaging supplies used in our carl s jr 
restaurant system and warehouse and distribute such items to both company operated and franchised carl s jr 
restaurants 
although not required to do so  our carl s jr 
franchisees in california and some adjacent states purchase most of their food  packaging and supplies from us 
we have elected not to outsource our carl s jr 
distribution activities because we believe our mature procurement process allows us to effectively manage our food costs  provide adequate quantities of food and supplies at competitive prices  generate revenue from carl s jr 
franchisees by adding a nominal mark up to cover direct costs and provide better overall service to our restaurants in california 
we seek competitive bids from suppliers on many of our products  approve suppliers of those products and require them to adhere to our established product specifications 
we currently purchase substantially all of the food  packaging and supplies sold or used in our hardee s restaurants from mbm corporation mbm see risk factors we depend on our suppliers to deliver quality products to us timely on page mbm currently distributes products to company operated restaurants and to many of the franchised hardee s restaurants 
pursuant to the terms of our distribution agreements  we are obligated to purchase substantially all of our specified product requirements from mbm through the middle of july the prices and delivery fees we pay for mbm products are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which may include increases or decreases resulting from changes in mbm s cost structure 
we purchase most of the food  packaging and supplies used in our la salsa restaurants from mccabe s quality foods mccabe s 
we have distribution agreements with both mccabe s  which services restaurants in california  nevada and arizona  and sysco  which distributes to a small number of our outer market franchise restaurants 
the agreements with sysco and mccabe s expire in fiscal and  respectively 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations long term obligations  for information about our unconditional purchase obligations 
competition and markets the restaurant business is intensely competitive and affected by changes in a geographic area  changes in the public s eating habits and preferences  local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits  population trends and local traffic patterns 
key elements of competition in the industry are the price  quality and value of food products offered  quality and speed of service  advertising effectiveness  brand name identification  restaurant locations and attractiveness of facilities 
we primarily compete with major restaurant chains  some of whom dominate the qsr industry  and also compete with a variety of other take out foodservice companies and fast food restaurants 
our competitors also include a variety of mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  health and nutrition oriented restaurants  delicatessens and prepared food restaurants  as well as supermarkets and convenience stores 
in selling franchises  we compete with many other restaurant franchisors  some of whom have substantially greater financial resources and higher franchise auvs 
trademarks and service marks we own numerous trademarks and service marks  and have registered many of those marks with the united states patent and trademark office  including carl s jr  the happy star logo  hardee s  la salsa fresh mexican grill and proprietary names for a number of the carl s jr 
and hardee s menu items 
we believe our trademarks and service marks have value and play an important role in our marketing efforts 
government regulation each company operated and franchised restaurant must comply with regulations adopted by federal agencies and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health  sanitation  safety  fire and other departments 
in addition  these restaurants must comply with federal and state environmental 
table of contents regulations  but those regulations have not had a material effect on the restaurants operations 
stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors can delay and sometimes prevent development of new restaurants and remodeling of existing restaurants in particular locations 
we are also subject to federal laws and a substantial number of state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
such laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises and may include substantive standards regarding the relationship between franchisor and franchisee  including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or otherwise alter franchise arrangements 
we believe we are operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our franchise operations 
we  and our franchisees  must comply with the fair labor standards act and various federal and state laws governing employment matters  such as minimum wages  overtime pay practices  child labor laws and other working conditions and citizenship requirements 
many of our employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs 
federal and state laws may also require us to provide new or increased levels of employee benefits to our employees  many of whom are not currently eligible for such benefits 
the company monitors its facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act ada in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  the company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that such expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these laws govern discharges to air and water from our restaurants  as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws may impose liability for damages from and the costs of cleaning up sites of spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous materials 
we may be responsible for environmental conditions relating to our restaurants and the land on which our restaurants are located  regardless of whether we lease or own the restaurants or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant 
we cannot provide assurance that all such environmental conditions have been identified by us 
these conditions include the presence of asbestos containing materials  leaking underground storage tanks and on site spills 
further  certain properties formerly had landfills  historic industrial use  gasoline stations and or dry cleaning businesses located on or near the premises 
corrective action  as required by the regulatory agencies  has been undertaken at some of the sites  although the majority of these sites are being remediated by former landowners or tenants 
the enforcement of our rights against third parties for environmental conditions  such as off site sources of contamination  may result in additional transaction costs for us 
seasonality we operate on a retail accounting calendar 
our fiscal year has four week accounting periods and ends the last monday in january 
the first quarter of our fiscal year has four periods  or weeks 
all other quarters have three periods  or weeks 
fiscal  which ended on january   includes weeks which included one five week accounting period in our fourth fiscal quarter  whereas fiscal and each include weeks 
our restaurant sales and  therefore  our profitability  are subject to seasonal fluctuations and are traditionally higher during the spring and summer months because of factors such as increased travel and better weather conditions  which affect the public s dining habits 

table of contents government contracts no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 
research and development we operate research and development facilities in california and missouri 
while research and development activities are important to our business  these expenditures are not material 
employees we employ approximately  persons  primarily in company operated restaurants and in our corporate offices and distribution facilities 
only those employees working at the la salsa restaurant located in the luxor hotel in las vegas  nevada are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage attributable to labor disputes 
past attempts to unionize our distribution center employees have been rejected by employee votes 
we believe our employee relations are good 
working capital practices information about our liquidity is contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   and in part ii  item  pages through  and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended january   and in part ii  item  page of this form k 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements matters discussed in this form k contain forward looking statements relating to future plans and developments  financial goals  and operating performance that are based on our current beliefs and assumptions 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described include  but are not limited to  whether or not restaurants will be closed and the number of restaurant closures  consumers concerns or adverse publicity regarding our products  the effectiveness of operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts particularly at the hardee s brand  changes in economic conditions or prevailing interest rates  changes in the price or availability of commodities  availability and cost of energy  workers compensation and general liability premiums and claims experience  changes in our suppliers ability to provide quality and timely products  delays in opening new restaurants or completing remodels  severe weather conditions  the operational and financial success of our franchisees  our franchisees willingness to participate in our strategy  the availability of financing for us and our franchisees  unfavorable outcomes in litigation  changes in accounting policies and practices  effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting  new legislation or government regulation including environmental laws  the availability of suitable locations and terms for the sites designed for development  and other factors as discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law or the rules of the new york stock exchange 
risk factors we are engaged in a business strategy that includes the turnaround of our hardee s operations 
the success of a business strategy  by its very nature  involves a significant number of risks  many of which are discussed below our success depends on our ability to judge the impact of competitive products and pricing 
successful operation of our restaurants requires the ability to identify the effects of product and pricing trends 
if we are unable to evaluate the impact of product or pricing trends effectively  we may fail to 
table of contents implement strategies allowing us to capitalize on those trends  which may result in decreased sales or increased costs 
our success depends on our ability to compete with our competitors 
the foodservice industry is intensely competitive with respect to the quality and value of food products offered  concept service  price  dining experience and location 
we compete with major restaurant chains  some of which dominate the qsr segment 
our competitors also include a variety of mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  health and nutrition oriented restaurants  delicatessens and prepared food restaurants  as well as supermarkets and convenience stores 
many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition  as well as greater financial  marketing  operating and other resources than we have  which may give them competitive advantages 
our competitors could also make changes to pricing or other marketing strategies which may impact us detrimentally 
as our competitors expand operations  we expect competition to intensify 
such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we may be unable to remain competitive or grow because we are a leveraged company 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of january   we had a total of  of debt and capital lease obligations 
this indebtedness requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  which could prevent us from implementing growth plans or proceeding with operational improvement initiatives 
for instance  the principal measure of success in the qsr segment is same store sales 
remodeling older restaurants is an effective way to stimulate sales 
if we are required to divert cash flow from the remodeling of older restaurants or the opening of new restaurants to repayment of debt  we may be at a disadvantage compared to our competitors and our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions may be increased 
as of january   we had  outstanding under the revolving portion and  outstanding under the term loan portion of our senior credit facility  and  in outstanding letter of credit obligations 
we face a series of maturity dates on our outstanding indebtedness that occur in close proximity to each other  beginning with the maturity of the revolving credit facility portion of our senior credit facility on may   the maturity date of the term loan portion of our senior credit facility on july   and the requirement to repurchase our  of convertible notes due at the option of the holders of the notes in october our leveraged status may prevent us from accessing credit or equity markets to satisfy our repayment obligations as they mature on favorable terms  or at all 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility and outstanding senior indebtedness could adversely affect our business 
our credit facility and our other outstanding senior indebtedness contain restrictive covenants and  in the case of our credit facility  requirements that we comply with certain financial ratios 
these covenants limit our ability to take various actions  including the incurrence of additional debt  the guaranteeing of indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions  including mergers and sales of assets  and making specified distributions or other restricted payments  including investments 
these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of business opportunities 
failure to maintain financial ratios required by our credit facility or to comply with the covenants in our credit facility or our other indebtedness could also result in acceleration of our indebtedness  which would impair our liquidity and limit our ability to operate 
failure to continue our revitalization of hardee s would have a significant negative effect on our success 
we have been challenged in our efforts to reestablish the connection between hardee s and consumers 
our efforts have included developing new marketing strategies  remodeling restaurants  refranchising restaurants  product variety  and a focus on the fundamentals of quality  service and cleanliness 
hardee s performance has improved significantly  however  we believe hardee s remains an under performing brand 

table of contents our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
we believe that our success will depend  in part  on the continuing services of our key management personnel 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material impact on our financial results 
additionally  our success may depend on our ability to attract and retain additional skilled management personnel 
our success depends on our franchisees participation in our strategy 
our franchisees are an integral part of our business 
we may be unable to successfully implement our brand strategies if our franchisees do not participate in that implementation 
the failure of our franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations  such as quality  service and cleanliness  would have a negative impact on our success 
our financial results are affected by the financial results of our franchisees 
we receive royalties from our franchisees 
our financial results are somewhat contingent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees  including implementation of our strategic plans  as well as their ability to secure adequate financing 
if sales trends or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised restaurants 
additionally  refusal on the part of franchisees to renew their franchise agreements may result in decreased royalties 
entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
we may be unable to recover increased operating costs through price increases 
the qsr segment historically has attracted consumers that are either lower income and or pressed for time 
an economic downturn that decreases our customers disposable incomes would have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 
in addition  unfavorable macroeconomic trends or developments concerning factors such as increased food  labor and employee benefit costs and availability of experienced employees may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to increase prices to match increased costs without further harming our sales 
if we are unable to raise prices in order to recover increased costs for food  fuel  utilities  wages  clothing and equipment  our profitability will be negatively affected 
we face commodity price and availability risks 
we purchase energy and agricultural products that are subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors that are not predictable or within our control 
increases in commodity prices could result in lower restaurant level operating margins for our restaurant concepts 
occasionally  the availability of commodities can be limited due to circumstances beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain such commodities  we may be unable to offer related products  which would have a negative impact on our profitability 
we depend on our suppliers to deliver quality products to us timely 
our profitability is dependent on  among other things  our continuing ability to offer fresh  high quality food at moderate prices 
while we continue to operate our own distribution business for most of our carl s jr 
system  we rely upon independent distributors for our hardee s and la salsa restaurants 
our hardee s restaurants depend on the distribution services of mbm corporation  an independent supplier and distributor of food and other products 
mbm is responsible for delivering food  paper and other products from our vendors to our hardee s restaurants on a regular basis 
mbm also provides distribution services to a large number of our hardee s franchisees 
we purchase most of the food  packaging and supplies used in our la salsa restaurants from mccabe s quality foods 
we have distribution agreements with both mccabe s quality foods  which services restaurants in california  nevada and arizona  and sysco  which distributes to a small number of our franchise restaurants outside these states 
the agreements with sysco and mccabe s quality 
table of contents foods expire in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  our dependence on frequent deliveries of food and paper products subjects our restaurants to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply  caused by adverse weather or other conditions  could adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
any disruption in these distribution services could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
adverse publicity regarding beef could negatively impact our business 
given the events regarding afflictions affecting livestock in various parts of the world  such as mad cow disease  it is possible that the production and supply of beef could be negatively impacted 
a reduction in the supply of beef could have a material effect on the price at which it could be obtained 
in addition  concerns regarding hormones  steroids and antibiotics may cause consumers to reduce or avoid consumption of beef 
failure to procure beef at reasonable terms and prices  or any reduction in consumption of beef by consumers  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
consumer preferences and perceptions may have significant effects on our business 
foodservice businesses are often affected by changes in consumer tastes and perceptions 
traffic patterns  demographics and the type  number and locations of competing restaurants may adversely affect the performance of individual restaurants 
multi unit foodservice businesses such as ours can also be materially and adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants 
we can be similarly affected by consumer concerns with respect to the nutritional value of quick service food 
our operations are seasonal and heavily influenced by weather conditions 
weather  which is unpredictable  can adversely impact our sales 
harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants 
a heavy snowstorm can leave an entire metropolitan area snowbound  resulting in a reduction in sales 
our first and fourth quarters  notably the fourth quarter  include winter months when there is historically a lower level of sales 
because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi fixed in nature  the loss of sales during these periods adversely impacts our operating margins  resulting in restaurant operating losses 
these adverse  weather driven events principally arise at our hardee s  and to a lesser extent  la salsa restaurants 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future 
our business may suffer due to our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel and due to higher labor costs 
given that our restaurant level workforce requires large numbers of both entry level and skilled employees  low levels of unemployment could compromise our ability to provide quality service in our restaurants 
from time to time  we have had difficulty hiring and maintaining qualified restaurant management personnel 
increases in the minimum wage have impacted our labor costs 
due to the labor intensive nature of our business  a continuing shortage of labor or increases in minimum wage levels could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
our sales and profits may be materially and adversely affected by our inability to integrate acquisitions successfully 
our future results of operations and cash flow may depend in part upon our ability to integrate any future acquisitions and mergers 
if we are unable to achieve the strategic operating objectives we anticipate from any such acquisitions we may experience increased costs or decreased sales which would have a negative impact on our results from operations 
strategic operating initiatives that we may be unable to achieve include economies of scale in operations  cost reductions  sales increases and marketing initiatives 

table of contents our business may be impacted by increased insurance costs 
in the past we have been negatively affected by increases in both workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance due to our claims experience and rising healthcare costs 
although we seek to manage our claims to prevent increases  such increases can occur unexpectedly and without regard to our efforts to limit them 
if such increases occur  we may be unable to pass them along to the consumer through product price increases  resulting in decreased operating results 
our financial results may be impacted by our ability to select appropriate restaurant locations  construct new restaurants or complete remodels 
in recent years  we have not opened a significant number of new restaurants  as available cash was used to repay indebtedness 
our strategic plan  and a component of our business strategy  includes the construction of new restaurants and the remodeling of existing restaurants 
we and our franchisees face competition from other restaurant operators  retail chains  companies and developers for desirable site locations  which may adversely affect the cost  implementation and timing of our expansion plans 
if we experience delays in the construction process we may be unable to complete such construction activities at the planned cost  which would adversely affect our future results from operations 
additionally  we cannot assure you that such remodels and conversions will increase the revenues generated by these restaurants or be sustainable 
likewise  we cannot be sure that the sites we select for new restaurants will result in restaurants whose sales results meet our expectations 
the nature of our business exposes us to potential litigation 
we have thousands of interactions or transactions each day with vendors  franchisees  customers  employees and others 
in the ordinary course of business  disputes may arise for a number of reasons 
we cannot be certain that we will prevail in every legal action brought against us 
governmental regulations may change and require us to incur substantial expenditures to comply 
we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal  state and local level in many areas of our business  such as food safety and sanitation  the sale of alcoholic beverages  environmental issues and minimum wage 
governmental entities may change regulations that may require us to incur substantial cost increases in order to comply with such laws and regulations 
while we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to sanctions or civil remedies  including fines and injunctions 
the cost of compliance or the consequences of non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
compliance with environmental laws may affect our financial condition 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these laws govern discharges to air and water  as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws may also impose liability for damages from and the costs of cleaning up sites of spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous materials 
we may be responsible for environmental conditions or contamination relating to our restaurants and the land on which our restaurants are located  regardless of whether we lease or own the restaurant or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant 
the costs of any cleanup could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could limit the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include several provisions and features intended to render more difficult certain unsolicited or hostile attempts to acquire our business 
in addition  our board of 
table of contents directors has the authority  without further action by our stockholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  and to fix the rights  preferences and restrictions of such preferred stock 
these provisions may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we face risks related to interest rates 
our principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on our senior credit facility  the magnitude of which depends on the amount of borrowings we have outstanding 
as of january   we had  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility that bore an interest rate of libor plus an applicable margin  or  and  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility that bore interest at prime plus an applicable margin  or 
as of january   we also had  outstanding under the term loan portion of our credit facility  which bore interest at libor plus an applicable margin  or  and  in outstanding letter of credit obligations  which bore fees at 
our financial results may be impacted by changes in accounting policies and practices 
as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal  we began to include in our consolidated financial statements the operations of one of our hardee s franchisees and approximately hardee s advertising fund arrangements as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized a charge of  as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of the beginning of fiscal  we will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas revised  share based payment  which will require us to measure and record compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value 
additional future changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the us may materially adversely affect our financial results if we are required to change our methods of accounting for transactions

for  in cash and  in secured notes on september  we are a nationwide owner  operator and franchisor of quick service restaurants qsr s  operating principally under the carl s jr

chains are the tenth and eleventh largest quick service hamburger restaurant chains in the united states of america  respectively  according to the june  issue of nation s restaurant news

restaurants are located in the western united states  predominantly in california 
as of january   the hardee s system consisted of  restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated  restaurants 
hardee s restaurants are located primarily throughout the southeastern and midwestern united states 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales at company operated restaurants and revenue from franchisees  including franchise and royalty fees  sales to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees of food and 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands packaging products  rentals under real property leases and revenue from the sale of equipment to our franchisees 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of food and packaging costs  payroll and other employee benefits and occupancy and other operating expenses of company operated restaurants 
franchise operating costs include the cost of food and packaging products sold to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees  lease payments or depreciation expense on properties leased or subleased to our franchisees  the cost of equipment sold to franchisees  and franchise administrative support 
our revenue and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volume of company operated restaurants and  to a lesser extent  franchised and licensed restaurants 
during periods in which we report positive same store sales  those increases are achieved by our strategy that emphasizes premium products  as well as routine price increases prompted by increases in labor  food or other operating costs 
the impact of this strategy is evidenced by the increase in average guest check and  in fiscal and  the same store sales growth at carl s jr 
and hardee s  as shown in the tables on pages a consequence of this strategy was a decrease in transaction counts in fiscal and  also shown in the same tables  as some customers show a preference for lower priced fare 
many of our competitors strategies have been to offer lower prices or discounted fare  which we believe affect transaction counts 
we experienced negative transaction counts at hardee s from our acquisition of the brand through fiscal and at carl s jr 
for the four years leading up to fiscal  which we believe were due in part to increased competition from fast casual dining and other qsr companies offering products at discounted prices while we continued our focus on premium products 
in addition  the qsr sector has been impacted by shifts in customer food preferences to fast casual and other home meal replacement alternatives 
we cannot quantify how much of our historical transaction count declines were related to our business segment generally and how much were related to circumstances specifically involving our own brands 
in fiscal  however  this trend reversed  with carl s jr 
and hardee s both generating slight transaction count increases  which we believe reflect growing customer acceptance of our premium product strategy 
despite the decreases in most recent years  however  same store sales have increased at company operated carl s jr 
restaurants in each of the last five years and same store sales have increased at company operated hardee s restaurants during fiscal and from time to time  we experience increases in our general operating costs 
in the past  we have been successful at passing on such increases through price increases  but it has likely had an impact on transaction counts 
if we were unable to pass along such price increases  and at the same time could not increase our transaction counts  the recoverability of the carrying value of our restaurants could be impacted 
restatement of previously issued financial statements in march  we identified accounting errors that occurred in fiscal and prior fiscal years resulting from improper application of the provisions of financial accounting standards board technical bulletin ftb  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases 
ftb requires accounting for straight line rent expense to commence at the time the lessee receives full access to the leased property 
with respect to leased restaurant properties  we typically receive full access at the time we receive building permits in the case of land only leases or upon having access to the leased building in the case of land and building leases 
historically  we have commenced accounting for straight line rent expense at the time we began making rent payments to the landlord  which is typically several months after receiving full access to the leased property 
our improper application of ftb resulted in an understatement in rent expense  net  through fiscal in the cumulative amount of  such misapplication also resulted in an over understatement of rent expense  net  of  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
for the consolidated financial statements presented herein  we have restated our accumulated deficit  prepaid expenses and other 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands long term liabilities as of the end of fiscal to reflect the  cumulative understatement of rent expense  net  noted above 
because the impact of the error on fiscal  and was immaterial to the interim and annual periods within each of those fiscal years  we have recorded the entire impact on those fiscal years a net charge of in the fourth quarter of fiscal we did not amend our previously filed annual report on form k a for the fiscal year ended january   or our quarterly reports on form q or q a for fiscal  since none of the differences in the prior years interim or annual financial statements are considered by us to be material 
however  we determined the cumulative adjustment for the above corrections to be significant to the fourth quarter of fiscal results and  therefore  restated the consolidated balance sheet information included in prior k a  q a and q filings 
accordingly  readers of the financial statements should read the restated information in this annual report on form k as opposed to the previously filed information 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as expected  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
our most significant accounting policies require estimation of future cash flows used to assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  and to establish the estimated liability for closing restaurants and subsidizing lease payments of franchisees  estimation  using actuarially determined methods  of our self insured claim losses under our workers compensation  general and auto liability insurance programs  determination of appropriate estimated liabilities for loss contingencies  determination of lease terms for purposes of establishing depreciable lives for leasehold improvements  evaluating leases for capital versus operating lease treatment and establishing straight line rent expense periods  estimation of the appropriate allowances associated with franchise and license receivables and liabilities for franchise subleases  determination of the appropriate assumptions to use to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation for purposes of disclosures of pro forma net income  and estimation of our net deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
descriptions of these critical accounting policies follow 
impairment of property and equipment and other amortizable long lived assets held and used  held for sale or to be disposed of other than by sale we evaluate the carrying value of individual restaurants when the operating results have reasonably progressed to a point to adequately evaluate the probability of continuing operating losses or upon expectation that a restaurant will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands generally estimate the useful life of land and owned buildings to be to years and estimate the remaining useful life of restaurants subject to leases to range from the end of the lease term then in effect to the end of such lease term including all option periods 
we then estimate the future estimated cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the restaurant was opened or remodeled  and the trend of operations and expectations for future sales growth 
we also make judgments about future same store sales and the operating expenses and estimated useful life that we would expect with such level of same store sales and related estimated useful life 
we employ a probability weighted approach wherein we estimate the effectiveness of future sales and marketing efforts on same store sales 
if an estimate of the fair value of our assets becomes necessary  we typically base such estimate on forecasted cash flows discounted at the applicable restaurant concept s weighted average cost of capital 
during the second and fourth quarter of each fiscal year  we perform an asset recoverability analysis through which we estimate future cash flows for each of our restaurants based upon experience gained  current intentions about refranchising restaurants and closures  expected sales trends  internal plans and other relevant information 
as the operations of restaurants opened or remodeled in recent years progress to the point that their profitability and future prospects can adequately be evaluated  additional restaurants will become subject to review and to the possibility that impairments exist 
same store sales are the key indicator used to estimate future cash flow for evaluating recoverability 
for each of our restaurant concepts  to evaluate recoverability of restaurant assets we estimate same store sales will increase at an annual average rate of approximately over the remaining useful life of the restaurant 
the inflation rate assumed in making this calculation is 
if our same store sales do not perform at or above our forecasted level  or cost inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our restaurants may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
typically  restaurants are operated for three years before we test them for impairment 
also  restaurants typically are not tested for two years following a remodel 
we believe this provides the restaurant sufficient time to establish its presence in the market and build a customer base 
if we were to test all restaurants for impairment without regard to the amount of time the restaurants were operating  the total asset impairment would increase substantially 
in addition  if recently opened or remodeled restaurants do not eventually establish stronger market presence and build a customer base  the carrying value of certain of these restaurants may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
as of january   we had a total of restaurants among our three major restaurant concepts that generated negative cash flows in fiscal these restaurants had combined net book values of  included within these totals are restaurants with combined net book values of  that were not tested for impairment as of january   because they had not yet been operated for a sufficient period of time 
if these negative cash flow restaurants were not to begin generating positive cash flows within a reasonable period of time  the carrying value of these restaurants may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually during the first quarter of our fiscal year  and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not impairment may have occurred 
we consider the reporting unit level to be the brand level since the components eg  restaurants within each brand have similar economic characteristics  including products and services  production processes  types or classes of customers and distribution methods 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the brand 
fair value can be determined based on 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other restaurant brands 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use the assumptions in our strategic plan for items such as same store sales  store count growth rates  and the discount rate we consider to be the market discount rate for acquisitions of restaurant companies and brands 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the brands may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we evaluated the carl s jr 
brand  the only one of brands for which we currently carry goodwill  through which we concluded that the fair value of the net assets of carl s jr 
exceeded the carrying value  and thus no impairment charge was required 
as of january   we have  in goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  which relates to carl s jr 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we make decisions to close restaurants based on prospects for estimated future profitability  and sometimes we are forced to close restaurants due to circumstances beyond our control eg  a landlord s refusal to negotiate a new lease 
our restaurant operators evaluate each restaurant s performance every quarter 
when restaurants continue to perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location  as well as the likelihood of being able to improve an unprofitable restaurant 
based on the operator s judgment and a financial review  we estimate the future cash flows 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow or be profitable  and we are not contractually obligated to continue operating the restaurant  we may close the restaurant 
the estimated liability for closing restaurants on properties vacated is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay  as well as estimated maintenance costs until the lease has been abated 
the amount of the estimated liability established is generally the present value of these estimated future payments 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of these liabilities is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the liability is established 
the related discount is amortized and shown in facility action charges  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing restaurants is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants  which we determine based on our broker s a related party assessment of its ability to either successfully negotiate early terminations of our lease agreements with the lessors or sublease the property 
additionally  we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated or the owned property has been sold 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or sublease or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant restaurants are not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant restaurants are terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse previously established estimated liabilities  resulting in an increase in operating income 
the present value of our operating lease payment obligations on all closed restaurants is approximately  which represents the discounted amount we would be required to pay if we are unable to enter into sublease agreements or terminate the leases prior to the terms required in the lease agreements 
however  it is our experience that we can often terminate those leases for less than that amount  or sublease the property and  accordingly  we have recorded an estimated liability for operating lease obligations of  as of january  
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands estimated liability for self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our current and prior years losses related to workers compensation  general and auto liability insurance programs 
we have obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation  general and auto liability claims over insurance accrued liabilities are accounted for based on the present value of actuarial estimates of the amount of incurred and unpaid losses  based approximately on a risk free interest rate  which we estimate to be as of january  these estimates rely on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development 
the actuary  in determining the estimated liability  bases the assumptions on the average historical losses on claims we have incurred 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development we estimated in conjunction with the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve 
as such  if we experience a higher than expected number of claims or the costs of claims rise more than expected  then we may  in conjunction with the actuary  adjust the expected losses upward and our future self insurance expenses will rise 
within our semi annual actuary reports  our actuary provides a range of estimated unpaid losses for each insurance category 
using these estimates  we record adjustments to our insurance accrued liabilities  if necessary  to bring each accrual balance within the actuary s related range 
if our accrued liability exceeds the high end of the range  we record a credit to reduce the insurance accrued liability to the high end of the range 
if our accrued liability is below the low end of the range  we record a charge to increase the insurance accrued liability to the low end of the range 
then  based upon projected future self insurance expenses and adjusted insurance accrual balances relative to the midpoint of the actuary s range  we adjust our accrual rates for each insurance category prospectively to bring the respective accrued liabilities toward the midpoints of the actuary s respective ranges 
loss contingencies we maintain accrued liabilities for contingencies related to litigation 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies sfas  which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
those contingencies that are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the low end of the range 
in accordance with sfas  as of january   we have recorded an accrued liability for contingencies related to litigation in the amount of  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements herein for further information 
the assessment of contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related consolidated financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of contingencies may differ materially from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of january   we estimated the liability for those losses related to other litigation claims that we believe are reasonably possible to result in an adverse outcome  to be in the range of to in accordance with sfas  we have not recorded a liability for those losses 
accounting for lease obligations we lease a substantial portion of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the lease accounting evaluation may require significant exercise of judgment in estimating the fair value and useful life of the leased property and to establish the appropriate lease term 
the lease term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured because failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
such economic penalty 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands would typically result from our having to abandon buildings and other non detachable improvements upon vacating the property 
the lease term used for this evaluation also provides the basis for establishing depreciable lives for buildings subject to lease and leasehold improvements  as well as the period over which we record straight line rent expense 
in addition  the lease term is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and typically ends upon restaurant opening 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to such delays would result in greater rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
franchised and licensed operations we monitor the financial condition of certain franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
each quarter we perform an analysis to develop estimated bad debts for each franchisee 
we then compare the aggregate result of that analysis to the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust the allowance as appropriate 
additionally  we cease accruing royalties and rental income from franchisees that are materially delinquent in paying or in default for other reasons and reverse any royalties and rent income accrued during the fiscal quarter in which such delinquency or default occurs 
over time our assessment of individual franchisees may change 
for instance  we have had some franchisees  who in the past we had determined required an estimated loss equal to the total amount of the receivable  who have paid us in full or established a consistent record of payments generally one year such that we determined an allowance was no longer required 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we and or our franchisees may take to resolve franchise collections issues 
these actions may include the purchase of franchise restaurants by us or by other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement which may include a provision to defer certain royalty payments or reduce royalty rates in the future if royalty rates are not sufficient to cover our costs of service over the life of the franchise agreement  we record an estimated loss at the time we modify the agreements  a restructuring of the franchisee s business and or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary obligee see further discussion below or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable course of action that will occur 
many of the restaurants that we sold to hardee s and carl s jr 
franchisees as part of our refranchising program were on leased sites 
generally  we remain principally liable for the lease and have entered into a sublease with the franchisee on the same terms as the primary lease 
in such cases  we account for the sublease payments received as franchising rental income and the lease payments we make as rental expense in franchised and licensed restaurants and other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of january   the present value of our total obligation on lease arrangements with hardee s and carl s jr 
franchisees  including subsidized leases discussed further below  was  and  respectively 
we do not expect carl s jr 
franchisees to experience the same level of financial difficulties as hardee s franchisees have encountered in the past  however  we can provide no assurance that this will not occur 
in addition to the sublease arrangements with franchisees described above  we also lease land and buildings to franchisees 
as of january   the net book value of property under lease to hardee s and carl s jr 
franchisees was  and  respectively 
financially troubled franchisees are those with whom we have entered into workout agreements and who may have liquidity problems in the future 
in the event that a financially troubled franchisee closes a restaurant for which we own the property  our options are to operate the restaurant as a company operated restaurant  lease the property to another tenant or sell the 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands property 
these circumstances would cause us to consider whether the carrying value of the land and building was impaired 
if we determined the property value was impaired  we would record a charge to operations for the amount the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value 
as of january   the net book value of property under lease to hardee s franchisees that are considered to be financially troubled franchisees was approximately  and is included in the amount above 
during fiscal or thereafter  some of these franchisees may close restaurants and  accordingly  we may record an impairment loss in connection with some of these closures 
prior to adoption of sfas  the determination of when to establish an estimated liability for future lease obligations on restaurants operated by franchisees for which we are the primary obligee was based on the date that either of the following events occurred we and the franchisee mutually decided to close a restaurant and we assumed the responsibility for the lease  usually after a franchise agreement was terminated or the franchisee declared bankruptcy  or we entered into a workout agreement with a financially troubled franchisee  wherein we agreed to make part or all of the lease payments for the franchisee 
in accordance with sfas  which we adopted on january   an estimated liability for future lease obligations on restaurants operated by franchisees for which we are the primary obligee is established on the date the franchisee closes the restaurant 
also  we record an estimated liability for subsidized lease payments when we sign a sublease agreement committing us to the subsidy 
the liability includes an estimation related to the risk that certain lease payments from the franchisee may ultimately be uncollectible 
the amount of the estimated liability is established using the methodology described in estimated liability for closing restaurants above 
because losses are typically not probable and or able to be reasonably estimated  we have not established an additional estimated liability for potential losses not yet incurred under a significant portion of our franchise sublease arrangements 
the present value of the lease obligations for which we remain principally liable and have entered into subleases with financially troubled franchisees is approximately  six financially troubled franchisees represent approximately of this amount 
if sales trends economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised restaurants 
entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future see discussion above 
the likelihood of needing to increase the estimated liability for future lease obligations is primarily related to the success of our hardee s concept ie  if our hardee s concept results improve from the execution of our comprehensive plan  we would reasonably expect that the financial performance of our franchisees would improve 
stock based compensation as discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various stock based compensation plans that provide options for certain employees and non employee directors to purchase shares of our common stock 
we have elected to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  which utilizes the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  as opposed to using the fair value method prescribed in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
because of this election  we are required to make certain disclosures of pro forma net income assuming we had adopted sfas we determine the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the historical stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for analysis of the effect of certain changes in assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we will be required to adopt sfas revised  share based payment  as of the beginning of fiscal valuation allowance for net deferred tax asset as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities that may offset our deferred tax assets for income tax accounting purposes 
if our business turnaround is successful  we have been profitable for a number of years and our prospects for the realization of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not  we would then reverse our valuation allowance and credit income tax expense 
in assessing the prospects for future profitability  many of the assessments of same store sales and cash flows mentioned above become relevant 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized from future taxable income 
as of january   our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance were approximately  and  respectively  resulting in a net deferred tax liability of  of which is included in other current liabilities and  is included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
restaurant portfolio strategy as described above  in late fiscal we embarked on a refranchising initiative to generate cash to reduce outstanding borrowings on our senior credit facility  as well as increase the number of franchise operated restaurants 
additionally  as sales trends for the hardee s restaurants and certain carl s jr 
restaurants primarily in the oklahoma area continued to decline in fiscal through fiscal  we determined that it was necessary to close certain restaurants for which a return to profitability was not likely 
these activities resulted in the charges reflected in our consolidated financial statements as facility action charges 
during fiscal  and  we recorded facility action charges of   and  respectively  which were primarily non cash in nature 
we have made reductions to operating expenses in an effort to bring them to levels commensurate with our re balanced restaurant portfolio 
the asset sales arising from our facility actions have resulted in a decline in restaurant revenue and costs over the long term because we operate fewer restaurants  however  our more stable restaurant portfolio and growing same store sales at carl s jr 
and hardee s in fiscal and have resulted in an increase in restaurant revenues and costs during these two fiscal years 
business strategy we remain focused on pursuing vigorously a comprehensive business strategy 
the main components of our strategy are as follows remain focused on restaurant fundamentals quality  service and cleanliness  offer premium products that compete on quality and taste not price  build on the strength of the carl s jr

we believe key factors in operating hardee s profitably are increasing sales and continued efforts to build upon the early success of the turnaround program 
for the fiscal year ended january   the auv at our company operated hardee s restaurants was approximately  while the auv at franchise operated restaurants was  representing a second consecutive year of growth in these sales performance measures 
if we are unable to grow sales at hardee s to the level at which we estimate the brand would operate profitably and improve operating margins  it will affect our ability to access both the amount and terms of financing available to us in the future see liquidity and capital resources section below 
franchisees operations like others in the quick service restaurant industry  some of our franchisees experience financial difficulties from time to time with respect to their operations 
our approach to dealing with financial and operational issues that arise from these situations is described under critical accounting policies above  under the heading franchised and licensed operations 
some franchisees in the hardee s system have experienced significant financial problems and  as discussed above  there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues 
we continue to work with franchisees in an attempt to maximize our future franchising income 
our franchising income is dependent on both the number of restaurants operated by franchisees and their operational and financial success  such that they can make their royalty and lease payments to us 
although we quarterly review the allowance for doubtful accounts and the estimated liability for closed franchise restaurants see discussion under critical accounting policies franchised and licensed operations  there can be no assurance that the number of franchisees or franchised restaurants experiencing financial difficulties will not increase from our current assessments  nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in resolving financial issues relating to any specific franchisee 
as of january   our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts of notes receivable was of the gross balance of notes receivable and our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable was of the gross balance of accounts receivable 
during fiscal year and  to a lesser extent  in fiscal  we established several notes receivable pursuant to completing workout agreements with several troubled franchisees 
also  as of january   we have not recognized  in accounts receivable and  in notes receivable  nor the royalty and rent revenue associated with these accounts and notes receivable  due from franchisees that are in default under the terms of their franchise agreements 
we still experience specific problems with troubled franchisees see critical accounting policies franchise and licensed operations and may be required to increase the amount of our allowances for doubtful accounts and or increase the amount of our estimated liability for future lease obligations 
the result of increasing the allowance for doubtful accounts is an effective royalty rate lower than our standard contractual royalty rate 
effective royalty rate reflects royalties deemed collectible as a percent of franchise generated revenue for all franchisees for which we are recognizing revenue 
for the fiscal year ended january   the effective royalty rates for domestic carl s jr

we believe ebitda is useful to our investors as an indicator of earnings available to service debt 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to income from operations  an indicator of cash flow from operations or a measure of liquidity 
as shown in the table below  we calculate ebitda as earnings before cumulative effect of accounting changes  discontinued operations  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  facility action charges  impairment of goodwill and impairment of assets held for sale 
because not all companies calculate ebitda identically  this presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
additionally  we believe ebitda is a more meaningful indicator of earnings available to service debt when certain charges  such as impairment of goodwill and facility action charges  are excluded from income loss from continuing operations 
ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest expense  income taxes  debt service payments and cash costs arising from facility actions

general liability insurance expense increased as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to an adjustment in the prior year quarter to reflect a significant decrease in actuarial estimates of claim reserves pertaining to prior policy years during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from our semi annual actuarial analysis 
general liability insurance expense as a percent of sales has remained relatively constant during fiscal fixed asset retirement costs as a percentage of sales decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the fourth quarter of fiscal due to increased charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the final removal of old equipment in connection with the hardee s menu update and star hardee s remodeling efforts 
the decrease in write down of promotional items in the fourth quarter of fiscal is due to the write down of certain promotional items during the fourth quarter of fiscal  for which there was no comparable promotional program in fiscal repair and maintenance costs increased as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the fourth quarter of fiscal due to an adjustment to increase our accrual for unpaid repair and maintenance obligations and a general increase in repair and maintenance activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal equipment lease expense increased as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the ending of a capital lease period for certain point of sale systems equipment during the third quarter of fiscal and the commencement of an operating lease period for the same equipment at that time

accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment sfas r  which amends fasb statements and sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  and will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after june  this new standard may be adopted in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the accounting change will have on our financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation has an impact on food and packaging  construction  occupancy  labor and benefit  and general and administrative costs  all of which can significantly affect our operations 
historically  consistent with the industry  we have been able to pass along to our customers  through price increases  higher costs arising from these inflationary factors 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonality 
average restaurant sales are normally higher in the summer months than during the winter months for each of our restaurant concepts 
in comparison with our carl s jr 
and la salsa restaurant concepts  inclement weather has a greater impact on restaurant sales at our hardee s restaurants  because a significant number of them are located in areas that experience severe winter conditions  principally in the midwest and certain east coast locations 
competition as discussed above in item business  the foodservice industry is intensively competitive in several aspects with respect to several factors 
we compete with a diverse group of food service companies major restaurant chains  casual dining restaurants  nutrition oriented restaurants and prepared food stores  making it difficult to attribute specific results of operations to the actions of any of our competitors 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our business through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and  during our refranchising efforts which have slowed considerably since fiscal  the sale of restaurants 
we believe our most significant cash use during the next months will be for capital expenditures 
we amended and restated our senior credit facility facility on june  and on april  see below 
we anticipate that existing cash balances  borrowing capacity under the facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to service existing debt and to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
additionally  we are able to sell restaurants as a source of liquidity  although we have no intention to do so significantly at this time 
we have no potential mandatory payments of principal on our  of convertible subordinated notes due until october  
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands we  and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new sites and the refurbishment of existing sites  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets  resulting in a working capital deficit 
as of january   our current ratio was to the facility provides for a  senior secured credit facility consisting of a  revolving credit facility and a  term loan 
the revolving credit facility matures on may   and includes an  letter of credit sub facility 
the principal amount of the term loan is scheduled to be repaid in quarterly installments  with a balloon payment of the remaining principal balance that is scheduled to mature on july  subject to certain conditions as defined in the facility  the maturity of the term loan may be extended to may  we used a portion of the proceeds from the  term loan to repay the  remaining balance of a prior facility term loan 
on july   we used additional proceeds from the  term loan to redeem our  of senior subordinated notes due senior notes and pay the related optional redemption premium of  and accrued interest 
we also incurred a charge of approximately  during our second quarter of fiscal to write off unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes 
from the june  issuance of the  term loan through january   we voluntarily prepaid  of the  term loan  in addition to the  regularly scheduled quarterly payments 
as of january   we had i cash borrowings outstanding under the term loan and revolving portions of the facility of  and  respectively  ii outstanding letters of credit under the revolving portion of the facility of  and iii availability under the revolving portion of the facility of  subsequent to january   we have voluntarily prepaid an additional  on our term loan in addition to our regularly scheduled quarterly payment of  reducing the balance to the terms of the facility include certain restrictive covenants 
among other things  these covenants restrict our ability to incur debt  incur liens on our assets  make any significant change in our corporate structure or the nature of our business  dispose of assets in the collateral pool securing the facility  prepay certain debt  engage in a change of control transaction without the member banks consents and make investments or acquisitions 
the facility is collateralized by a lien on all of our personal property assets and liens on certain restaurant properties 
as of january   the applicable interest rate on the term loan was libor plus  or per annum  the applicable rate on  of the revolving loan portion of the facility was libor plus  or per annum  and the applicable interest rate on the remaining  of the revolving loan was prime plus  or per annum 
we also incur fees on outstanding letters of credit under the facility at a rate equal to the applicable margin for libor loans  which is currently per annum 
the facility also required us to enter into interest rate protection agreements in an aggregate notional amount of at least  for a term of at least three years 
pursuant to this requirement  on july   we entered into two interest rate cap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of  under the terms of each agreement  if libor exceeds on the measurement date for any quarterly period  we will receive payments equal to the amount libor exceeds  multiplied by i the notional amount of the agreement  and ii the fraction of a year represented by the quarterly period 
the agreements expire on july  the agreements were not designated as cash flow hedges under the terms of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of the of interest rate cap premiums is recognized quarterly in interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded of interest expense to reduce the carrying value of the

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands interest rate cap premiums to their fair value of at january  as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure 
subject to the terms of the facility  we may make annual capital expenditures in the amount of  plus of the amount of actual ebitda as defined in excess of  we may also carry forward any unused capital expenditure amounts to the following year 
based on these terms  the facility permits us to make capital expenditures of at least  in fiscal  which could increase further based on our performance versus the ebitda formula described above 
the facility also permits us to repurchase our common stock in an amount up to approximately  as of january  in addition  the dollar amount of common stock that we may purchase is increased each year by a portion of excess cash flow as defined during the term of the facility 
our board of directors has authorized a program to allow us to repurchase up to  of our common stock 
based on the board of directors authorization and the amount of repurchase of our common stock that we have already made thereunder  as of january   we are permitted to make an additional repurchase of our common stock up to  until recently  the facility prohibited us from paying cash dividends 
on april   we amended the facility to permit us to pay cash dividends on substantially the same terms as we were and are permitted to repurchase shares of our common stock 
on april   we announced our board of directors declaration of a cash dividend of per share of our common stock to be paid on june   to our stockholders of record on may   and further announced our intention to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend 
this amendment to the facility also resulted in a decrease in the borrowing rate under our term loan  a decrease in the borrowing rate on revolving loans and a decrease in our letter of credit fee rate 
the facility contains financial performance covenants  which include a minimum ebitda requirement  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants and all other requirements of the facility as of january  the full text of the contractual requirements imposed by the facility is set forth in the sixth amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of june   and amendments no 
and thereto  which we have filed with the securities and exchange commission  and in the ancillary loan documents described therein 
subject to cure periods in certain instances  the lenders under our facility may demand repayment of borrowings prior to stated maturity upon certain events  including if we breach the terms of the agreement  suffer a material adverse change  engage in a change of control transaction  suffer certain adverse legal judgments  in the event of specified events of insolvency or if we default on other significant obligations 
in the event the facility is declared accelerated by the lenders which can occur only if we are in default under the facility  our convertible notes described below may also become accelerated under certain circumstances and after all cure periods have expired 
on september   we completed an offering of  of our convertible subordinated notes due convertible notes  and used nearly all of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase  of our then outstanding convertible subordinated notes due the convertible notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at annually  are payable in semiannual installments due april and october each year  and are unsecured general obligations of ours  contractually subordinate in right of payment to certain of our other obligations  including the facility 
on october of  and  the holders of the convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at of the face value plus accrued interest 
on october  and thereafter  we have the right to call all or a portion of the notes at of the face value plus accrued interest 
under the terms of the 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands convertible notes  such notes become convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share at any time after our common stock has a closing sale price of at least per share  which is of the conversion price per share  for at least days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter 
as a result of the daily closing sales price levels on our common stock during the second calendar quarter of  the convertible notes became convertible into our common stock effective july   and will remain convertible throughout the remainder of their term 
the terms of the facility are not dependent on any change in our credit rating 
the convertible notes contain a convertibility trigger based on the credit ratings of the notes  however  such trigger is no longer applicable since the notes are now convertible through the remainder of their term  as discussed above 
we believe the key company specific factors affecting our ability to maintain our existing debt financing relationships and to access such capital in the future are our present and expected levels of profitability and cash flow from operations  asset collateral bases and the level of our equity capital relative to our debt obligations 
in addition  as noted above  our existing debt agreements include significant restrictions on future financings including  among others  limits on the amount of indebtedness we may incur or which may be secured by any of our assets 
during the fiscal year ended january   cash provided by operating activities was  an increase of  or over the prior year comparable period 
the increase resulted mainly from a  increase in net income  partially offset by the  write off of la salsa goodwill which took place in fiscal with no similar write off in fiscal  as well as a trend change in the accounts payable balance fluctuation in the current year as compared to the prior year 
such trend can vary significantly from year to year depending upon the timing of large vendor payments  but is not anticipated to be a significant source or use of cash in future periods 
in addition  the current year includes a  decrease in depreciation and amortization and a  decrease in the provision for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal totaled  which principally consisted of purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  proceeds from the disposition of timber lodge  and collections on notes receivable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our principal exposure to financial market risks relates to the impact that interest rate changes could have on our  facility 
as of january   we had  and  in borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the facility  respectively 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction in the company s annual pre tax earnings of  the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of the facility  and assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt as in effect january  substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on us and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
the purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements we use may result in unconditional purchase obligations  which are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
typically  we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address material commodity cost increases by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices  without adjustments to our menu prices  could result in lower restaurant level operating margins for our restaurant concepts
