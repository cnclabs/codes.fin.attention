recent accounting standards in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
this sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
it includes such loans acquired in purchase business combinations and applies to all nongovernmental entities  including not for profit organizations 
this sop does not apply to loans originated by the entity 
this sop limits the yield that may be accreted accretable yield to the excess of the investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
this sop requires that the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected nonaccretable difference not be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual  or valuation allowance 
this sop prohibits investors from displaying accretable yield and nonaccretable difference in the balance sheet 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as impairment 
this sop prohibits carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this sop 
the prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans  and loans acquired in a purchase business combination 
this sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the changes required by this sop are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary and its application to certain investments 
the issue applies to debt and equity securities within the scope of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  certain debt and equity securities within the scope of sfas  and equity securities that are not subject to the scope of sfas and not accounted for under the equity method of accounting ie  cost method investments 
issue outlines a three step model for assessing other than temporary impairment 
the model involves first determining whether an investment is impaired  then evaluating whether the impairment is other than temporary  and if it is  recognizing an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
the model was to be applied prospectively to all current and future investments in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  however  in september the financial accounting standards board fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp eitf issue which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in issue the guidance for analyzing securities for impairment will be effective with the final issuance of fsp eitf issue a 
the disclosure guidance of issue remains effective and requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures for investments accounted for under sfas and sfas for the first annual reporting period ending after december  in addition  disclosures related to cost method investments are effective for annual reporting periods ending after june  comparative information for the periods prior to the period of initial application is not required 
see note  securities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for bancgroup s disclosures under issue the changes required by this eitf issue are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt sfas r on july  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no material impact on its overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would likely have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share included in the stock based compensation section of note  summary of significant accounting and reporting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies bancgroup s significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other footnotes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
those accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact comprehensive income  are considered critical accounting policies 
bancgroup recognizes the following as critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses and goodwill impairment analysis 
allowance for loan losses management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy and allocation of the allowance considers both impaired and unimpaired loans and takes into consideration the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and an analysis of current economic conditions 
while management believes that it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions which have resulted in an allowance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that in the future  adverse economic conditions  increased nonperforming loans  regulatory concerns  or other factors will not require further increases in  or re allocation  of the allowance 
a more detailed discussion of bancgroup s allowance for loan losses is included in the risk management section and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below illustrates bancgroup s sensitivity to changes in certain factors used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
estimated effect on provision expense assuming the following changes in each determining factor factors in thousands loan portfolio size net charge offs criticized loans criticized loans include all loans rated special mention or worse includes all nonperforming assets and severely past due loans 
these computations do not contemplate any action bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in each of these risk factors 
goodwill impairment analysis goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
bancgroup tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
the company has elected to perform its annual testing as of september each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining the assumptions used in the calculations 
the first step involves estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit s carrying value  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  then a second step is performed to measure the actual amount of goodwill impairment 
the second step initially involves determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair values of reporting units were estimated using discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings forecasts 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit included earnings forecasts for five years  terminal values based on future growth rates and discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations of each reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment analysis for indicated that no impairment write offs were required 
the table below illustrates bancgroup s sensitivity to changes in the rates used in discounting the estimated future cash flows 
the sensitivity analysis was based on information available as of the annual test date of september  further discussion regarding bancgroup s accounting for goodwill is included at note to the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity of goodwill impairment analysis results assuming the following changes in discount rates no change in thousands total excess of estimated fair value versus carrying value for all reporting units these computations do not take into account changes in the forecasted cash flows and future annual growth rates 
further  the computations do not contemplate any action bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in the risks associated with the operations of each reporting unit 
review of results of operations net interest income net interest income represents the difference  or spread  between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rate volatility  which impacts the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as their rates  can significantly impact net interest income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased or million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the principal factors affecting net interest income in were growth in average earning assets of along with an basis point improvement in the net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased to in compared to in the increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to the lower cost of interest bearing liabilities  which more than offset the decline in yield on earning assets

average interest earning assets average interest earning assets grew billion or in the average yield on earning assets declined six basis points in due to market rate declines in these declines encouraged a significant number of early loan payoffs and repositioned the loan portfolio in a lower rate environment 
the decline in the average yield on earning assets was lessened by the increases in market rates that occurred in the second half of during this period  the federal reserve raised the target federal funds rate basis points  and bancgroup raised its prime rate in conjunction with those increases 
approximately of bancgroup s loan portfolio is variable or adjustable rate and therefore is directly impacted by changes in market rates 
the composition of the earning asset growth is detailed in the sections below 
loans 
average total loans grew million or in over the average mortgage warehouse lending portfolio decreased million in mortgage warehouse lending is a centralized division that provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans to mortgage origination companies 
the record low mortgage rates available in and resulted in large increases in average loans for this division  as overall mortgage activity  both refinancings and purchases  reached record levels 
as mortgage rates increased the first half of  these volumes declined 
consequently  average mortgage warehouse loans as a percentage of average total loans was in compared to in the average yield in mortgage warehouse loans increased basis points in after declining basis points in the pricing of these loans is affected by changes in market rates and customer demand 
the average balance of loans  excluding mortgage warehouse lending  showed solid growth in and increased billion  or excluding the pcb acquisitions 
the average yield on the loan portfolio  excluding the mortgage warehouse division  was for  compared to for as a result of changes in market rates  the yield on loans  excluding mortgage warehouse lending  increased in the last two quarters of  but for the year was basis points below the average yield for loans held for sale 
loans held for sale represent single family residential mortgage loans either directly originated  or acquired as short term participations in mortgage loans 
it is the company s policy to enter into forward sales commitments at the same time these mortgage loans are originated or acquired 
average loans held for sale increased to million in from million in the average yield on the company s loans held for sale decreased basis points to in versus in securities 
on average  the securities portfolio increased to billion in from billion in securities comprised of average earning assets in compared to in the average yield increased to in from in the basis point increase in was primarily due to lower premium amortization on mortgage backed securities  as prepayments slowed during the fourth quarter of and remained slower throughout bancgroup also executed several transactions to improve the structure and yield of the securities portfolio  such as selling million in securities yielding and reinvesting those proceeds into securities yielding in the first quarter of the duration of the portfolio excluding equities declined during from an estimated duration of years at december  to years at december  average interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased  primarily from growth in interest bearing deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in  compared to in the lower average cost of funds in was primarily the result of a shift in deposit mix to non time deposits from time deposits  continued repricing of deposits in a lower rate environment and lower rates on long term debt as a result of prepaying certain long term advances and entering into interest rate swaps to convert fixed rates to floating rates 
the percentage of average non time deposits to total average deposits has improved with the ratio increasing to in compared to in interest bearing deposits 
average non time interest bearing deposits grew billion  or in excluding the pcb acquisition 
this growth was primarily from sales efforts to emphasize relationship deposit growth  particularly in the money market product during average time deposits remained relatively unchanged from decreased excluding the pcb acquisition 
the average rate on non time interest bearing deposits increased eight basis points to for compared to for  while the rate on time deposits declined basis points to an average of in compared to for bancgroup s growth in low cost deposits has decreased its dependence on borrowings whereby total average deposits comprise of the company s total funding for the year ended compared to in the shift in funding mix contributes favorably to bancgroup s interest rate risk profile and is expected to assist in containing funding costs in a rising interest rate environment 
borrowings 
average borrowings increased less than over due to strong deposit growth in which decreased the company s reliance on wholesale funding sources 
due to the previously discussed growth in deposits  average total borrowings were of average total assets for compared to for short term borrowings decreased million in the average rate on short term borrowings increased basis points to in versus in in conjunction with increases in the target federal funds rate 
the average balance of long term debt increased million in rates on long term debt declined basis points from due to bancgroup s prepayment of million in long term fhlb advances which had an average rate of  and entrance into interest rate swaps to convert the interest rates on million of long term fhlb advances from fixed to floating rates 
average noninterest earning assets average noninterest earning assets increased million to billion from to the increase was due largely to an increase in bank owned life insurance boli and noninterest earning assets obtained through acquisitions  such as goodwill and fixed assets 
average noninterest bearing liabilities average noninterest bearing liabilities increased by million from to  an increase 
this change primarily relates to the increase in average noninterest bearing deposits of million from to  a increase excluding the pcb acquisition 
as a result of the company s continuing effort to increase low cost or no cost deposits  the noninterest bearing deposit mix improved to of total deposits in up from in loan loss provision the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for net charge offs were and of average loans for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december  bancgroup had a reserve coverage of nonperforming loans compared to at december  the reduction in loan loss provision was the result of improved credit quality in the loan portfolio

financial planning services include discount brokerage  investment sales  asset management  trust services and insurance sales including term  universal  whole life and long term care 
the decrease in was primarily due to declines in sales of securities and annuity products and lower income from trust services 
electronic banking services enable our customers to bank when and where they want 
electronic banking includes an atm network  business and personal check card services and our internet banking with bill pay service 
the increases in electronic banking fees are primarily the result of deposit growth  increased check card activities and usage  an increase in visa s interchange fee rate  and an increase in usage of colonial s internet banking product 
mortgage banking is available in all of colonial s banking regions 
colonial offers both adjustable and fixed rate products 
adjustable rate products are generally retained in colonial s loan portfolio while fixed rate products are sold in the secondary market 
income from loans originated and subsequently sold in the secondary market is reflected in noninterest income 
mortgage banking income from secondary market loans decreased to million in the decreases are a direct result of changes in mortgage rates which resulted in less refinancing activity than in securities gains were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in securities gains were substantially offset by million in net fees related to early extinguishment of debt recorded in noninterest expense

salaries and employee benefits of additional employees from bank acquisitions and branch openings accounted for of this increase 
the remaining increase was due to normal salary increases  incentive related compensation  increases in production and back office support staffing and additional health care costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower production related compensation as a result of lower mortgage banking and financial planning services revenues 
occupancy expense for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the increase was primarily the result of acquisitions  the opening of a new technology center in the fourth quarter of and the strategic repositioning of branches within our markets through the opening of new locations and the closure of seven locations in alabama

review of statement of condition loans management s emphasis  within all of bancgroup s banking regions and specialized lending divisions  is on loan growth in accordance with local market demands and in reliance upon the lending experience and portfolio management expertise in these regions and divisions 
management believes that its strategy of meeting local demands and using local lending expertise has proven successful  especially when combined with the expertise offered by the managers of the specialized lending divisions such as mortgage warehouse and residential real estate 
loans  excluding mortgage warehouse lending  grew in excluding the pcb acquisition 
the strongest loan growth for the company in was in the florida regional bank segment with growth excluding the pcb acquisition  the texas regional bank segment with growth and the nevada regional bank segment with growth 
mortgage warehouse lending also grew in loans by category december  in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential installment and consumer mortgage warehouse lending other total loans  net of unearned income the increase in loans in compared to was primarily driven by growth in real estate loans  commercial  construction and residential  which account for of the net increase in loans 
growth in commercial real estate loans reflects an increase in retail  office and warehouse property types offset by declines in lodging and multi family 
the construction real estate portfolio is primarily made up of loans to finance construction projects within the company s banking markets and the growth in this category during was mostly in residential property types development  land zoned residential  home construction  residential lots and condominiums 
residential real estate loan growth was primarily driven by increases in home equity lines as consumers continue to take advantage of relatively low interest rates 
the majority of the remaining net increase in loans for as compared to was in mortgage warehouse lending loans  which continue to be a significant line of business for the company 
the contractual maturities of loans may vary significantly from actual maturities due to loan extensions  early payoffs due to refinancing and other factors 
fluctuations in interest rates are also a major factor in early loan payoffs 
the uncertainties of future events  particularly with respect to interest rates  make it difficult to predict the actual maturities

securities bancgroup determines the funds available for investment based upon anticipated loan and deposit growth  liquidity needs and pledging requirements  as well as other factors 
an investment strategy is developed based on these factors  along with the bank s balance sheet position and relative value opportunities in the market 
all securities are either classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those securities which management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
the carrying value of held to maturity investments was million at the end of the current year decline was due to paydowns  maturities and calls in the portfolio 
securities classified as held to maturity consisted primarily of us treasury bonds  agency mortgage backed securities and municipal obligations 
the stated maturity of these securities was years with an average life of years and an average duration of years 
securities available for sale represent those securities that the company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changes in the bank s interest rate risk position  prepayment risk or other similar factors 
these securities are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses  net of any tax effect  added to or deducted from shareholders equity 
at december   available for sale securities totaled billion or of the total portfolio 
the stated maturity of these securities was years with an average life of years and an average duration excluding equities of years

risk management credit risk management colonial has some measure of credit risk in most of its primary banking activities  but the majority of this risk is associated with lending 
colonial has structured its overall credit process so that the credit risk associated with lending can be effectively managed 
our credit risk management process is centered on comprehensive credit and underwriting policies and procedures  a strong and effective loan approval process  continual audit and review functions  and experienced credit professionals at the regional  business line  and bancgroup levels 
in addition  colonial has a credit risk reporting and analysis group and a special assets collections group which fall under the supervision of the chief credit officer 
the credit risk reporting and analysis group continually evaluates changes in credit risk  monitors large concentrations and exposures of all types and locations  and implements the bank s allowance methodology 
the special assets collections group is charged with minimizing losses  maximizing recoveries  and implementing strategies to reduce problem asset levels 
in addition  the internal auditor and regulatory examiners review and perform detailed tests of our credit risk management activities  such as credit underwriting  loan administration  and the allowance process 
the overall goals of our credit risk management activities include providing a sound basis for new credit extensions and early recognition of problems risks so that we can maintain a high quality loan portfolio and achieve long term earnings growth 
in addition to lending  credit risk is present in our securities portfolio  derivative instruments and in certain deposit activities 
the bank s investment area has credit risk management processes in place in order to manage risk in these activities 
loan approval and underwriting the chief credit officer  who reports directly to the chief executive officer  provides company wide credit oversight through a company wide senior credit administration function 
this function reviews larger credits prior to approval and also provides an independent review of credits on a continual basis 
in addition  the company has established regional loan committees made up of local officers and directors that approve loans up to certain levels 
these committees provide local business and market expertise while bancgroup s senior management provides independent oversight by participating in the state loan committees 
loans to the company s largest borrowers and loans originated out of specialized business units may go through these committees for approval  but also may go through additional committees established by the board of directors and administered by the chief credit officer 
bancgroup has standard policies and procedures for the evaluation and underwriting of new credits  including debt service evaluations and collateral guidelines 
collateral guidelines vary with the creditworthiness of the borrower  but generally require loan to value ratios not to exceed for commercial real estate  for construction  for development  for raw land  and for residential real estate 
commercial non real estate  financial and agricultural loans are generally collateralized by business inventory  accounts receivables or new business equipment at  and of estimated value  respectively 
installment and consumer loan collateral  where required  is based on or lower loan to value ratios 
collateral values referenced above are monitored and estimated by loan officers through inspections  independent appraisals  reference to broad measures of market values  and current experience with similar properties or collateral 
loans with loan to value ratios in excess of have potentially higher risks which are offset by other factors including the borrowers or guarantors creditworthiness  the borrowers other banking relationships  the bank s lending experience with the borrowers  and any other potential sources of repayment 
concentration bancgroup has a significant concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans representing and of total loans as of december   respectively 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans are spread geographically throughout alabama  florida and other areas including metropolitan atlanta  dallas  reno and las vegas with no more than of total commercial real estate and construction loans in any one metropolitan statistical area msa 
the alabama economy generally experiences a slow but steady rate of growth  while bancgroup s markets in florida  georgia  nevada and texas are experiencing higher rates of growth 
the collateral held in the commercial real estate and construction portfolios consists of various property types such as retail properties  family residential developments and lots  office buildings  land held for future development or construction  residential homes under construction  multi family housing  condominium properties  warehouses  lodging and health service facilities 
the relatively small average loan size and the application of conservative underwriting guidelines further reduce risk 
net charge offs to average loans for the commercial real estate portfolio were for net charge offs to average loans for the construction portfolio were for in addition to mortgages on the subject properties  substantially all construction and commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees of the principals involved 
the owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio represented of the total commercial real estate portfolio outstanding at december  owner occupied real estate is primarily dependent on cash flows from operating businesses rather than on the sale or rental of the property  therefore  these loans carry less risk than other commercial real estate loans 
management believes that its existing distribution of commercial real estate and construction loans  whether grouped geographically  by industry  or by borrower  reduces bancgroup s risk exposure 
the current distribution of commercial real estate and construction loans remains diverse in location  size  and collateral function 
this diversification  in addition to our emphasis on quality underwriting  serves to reduce the risk of losses 
the following charts reflect the geographic diversity and property type distribution of construction and commercial real estate loans at december  construction of total commercial real estate of total dollars in thousands average loan size geographic diversity florida alabama georgia texas nevada other total of property type distribution to of property type distribution to industry distribution december  construction portfolio total portfolio commercial real estate portfolio total portfolio residential development and lots retail land only office residential home construction multi family condominium warehouse retail other other lodging commercial development healthcare office church or school multi family recreation industrial total construction total commercial real estate other includes all loans in categories smaller than the lowest percentage shown above

bancgroup has a history of successfully lending in the residential real estate market and its quality ratios remain favorable in this portfolio segment 
net charge offs to average loans for the residential real estate portfolio was for the growth in this portfolio was mainly in home equity lines of credit which grew during and now represent of residential real estate loans 
this increase is due to the new equity line products that were introduced over the last few years as well as general market trends 
loans classified as commercial  financial  and agricultural  representing of total loans  consist of secured and unsecured credit lines and equipment loans for various industrial  agricultural  commercial  financial  retail  or service businesses 
the risks associated with loans in this category are generally related to the earnings capacity of  and the cash flows generated from  the individual business activities of the borrowers 
consumer loans  representing of total loans  are loans to individuals for various purposes 
automobile loans and unsecured loans make up the majority of these loans 
the principal source of repayment is the earning capacity of the individual borrower  as well as the value of the collateral for secured loans 
bancgroup maintains a mortgage warehouse lending division 
this department provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans to mortgage origination companies 
loans outstanding at december  were billion  with unfunded commitments of million 
the company has credits with commitments funded and unfunded of million that fall within the bank regulatory definition of a shared national credit generally defined as a total loan commitment in excess of million that is shared by three or more lenders 
the largest outstanding amount to any single borrower is million which is a mortgage warehouse lending credit  with the smallest credit being approximately  at december   million of these commitments were funded 
although by definition these commitments are considered shared national credits  bancgroup s loan officers have established long term relationships with each of these borrowers 
these commitments are comprised of the following mortgage warehouse lines to large institutions  commercial real estate credit facilities to companies with headquarters located within colonial s existing markets  one operating facility to a large national insurance company  and one international credit to a correspondent bank in argentina 
management believes that these are sound participations involving credits that fit within colonial s lending philosophy and meet its conservative underwriting guidelines 
allowance for loan losses colonial  through its lending and credit functions  continuously reviews its loan portfolio for credit risk 
colonial employs an independent credit review area that reviews the lending and credit functions to validate that credit risks are appropriately identified 
the company remains committed to the early recognition of problem loans and to ensuring an adequate level of allowance to cover losses 
at december   the company s total allowance was million  which represented of period end loans 
using input from the company s comprehensive credit risk identification process  the company s credit risk management area analyzes and validates the company s loan loss reserve methodology at least quarterly 
the analysis includes three basic elements specific allowances for individual loans  general allowances for loan pools  and allowances based on identified economic conditions and other risk factors 
the credit risk management area  along with senior management  review the methodology and ensure it is appropriate and that all material risk elements have been assessed in order to determine the appropriate level of allowance for the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at each quarter end 
in addition  the allowance methodology is discussed with and reviewed quarterly by the audit committee 
the first element of the allowance for loan losses analysis involves the calculation of specific allowances for individual impaired loans as required by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
in addition  the company requires that a broad group of loans be tested for impairment each quarter this includes all loans of  and over that have internal risk ratings below a predetermined classification level  plus all significantly past due loans of  and over 
the credit risk management area validates all impairment testing and validates the reserve allocations for all impaired loans each quarter 
reserves associated with this element are based on a thorough analysis of the most probable sources of repayment which is normally the liquidation of collateral  but also includes discounted future cash flows or the market value of the loan itself 
as of december  and  the specific allowance calculations for this element of the allowance totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the reserve between these two periods primarily resulted from a decline in the dollar amount of loans that met the criteria for impaired status 
the second reserve element is the general allowance for loan pools assessed by applying loan loss allowance factors to groups of loans within the portfolio that have similar characteristics 
this part of the methodology is governed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
the general allowance factors are based upon recent and historical charge off experience and are typically applied to the portfolio by loan type and internal risk rating 
historical loss analyses provide the basis for factors used for homogenous pools of smaller loans  such as residential real estate and other consumer loan categories which are not evaluated based on individual risk ratings but almost entirely based on historical losses 
the statistics used in the analysis of this second reserve element are adjusted quarterly based on loss trends and risk rating migrations 
as of december  and  the general allowance calculations totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase between the periods was primarily the result of portfolio growth which was partially offset by lower criticized and classified risk assets 
the third element of the allowance represents the effect of factors that are not fully captured elsewhere in the model  and includes amounts for deteriorating industries  macroeconomic factors and model imprecision 
the company analyzes and revises this part of the allowance at least quarterly 
the qualitative risk factors of this third allowance segment are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment 
as of december  and  the allowance calculated for economic conditions and other risk factors relating to specific loan categories totaled million and million  respectively 
the change in this portion of the reserve is due to increased interest rates in that subject the commercial real estate and construction portfolios to increased loss levels as well as other economic factors affecting commercial real estate 
in addition to the allocated portions  an unallocated amount is calculated to adjust the allowance for imprecision inherent in estimates used for the allocated portions of the reserve 
the unallocated allowance is the result of our judgement of risks inherent in the portfolio  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors  including industry trends 
at december  and  the unallocated allowance was million and million  respectively

when management determines that a loan no longer meets the criteria for a performing loan and collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual if full collection of principal and interest becomes unlikely even if all payments are current or if the loan is delinquent in principal or interest payments for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
bancgroup s policy is to charge off consumer installment loans days past due unless they are in the process of foreclosure and are adequately collateralized 
management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  renegotiated or nonaccrual 
these loans are summarized as follows nonperforming assets december  in thousands aggregate loans for which interest is not being accrued aggregate loans renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower total nonperforming loans other real estate and in substance foreclosure repossessions total nonperforming assets aggregate loans contractually past due days or more for which interest is being accrued total nonperforming loans as a percent of net loans total nonperforming assets as a percent of net loans  other real estate and repossessions total nonperforming loans and day past due loans for which interest is being accrued as a percent of net loans allowance for loan loss as a percent of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated total does not include loans contractually past due days or more  which are still accruing interest the above nonperforming loans represent all material credits for which management has significant doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
management also expects that the resolution of these problem credits as well as other performing loans will not materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
the balance of nonperforming assets declined million  or  during the year ended december  as a result of the resolution of problem assets through the sale of the loans or sale of underlying property  charge off  and payoffs of a number of larger assets including the sale of the bank s outstanding loans to argentine banks 
the balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions  nonperforming assets obtained in acquisitions  and the disproportionate impact of larger assets 
colonial has historically and consistently experienced favorable levels of nonperforming assets 
the recent improvements in nonperforming assets and other credit quality measures are the result of additional improvements in collection  work out and risk management efforts 
interest income recognized and interest income foregone on nonaccrual loans were not significant for the years ended december   and a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as mentioned previously  colonial s credit risk management area performs detailed verification and testing to ensure appropriate identification of impaired loans and that proper reserves are held on these loans 
the recorded investment in impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively  and these loans had a corresponding valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the average investment in impaired loans during and totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in impaired loans is primarily due to the resolution of several problem credits 
management  through its loan officers  internal credit review staff and external examinations by regulatory agencies  has identified approximately million of loans  which have been placed on a classified loan list excluding nonaccrual  other real estate  repossessions and loans that are contractually days past due 
the status of all material classified loans is reviewed at least monthly by loan officers  quarterly by bancgroup s centralized credit administration function and annually by regulatory agencies 
in connection with such reviews  collateral values are updated where considered necessary 
if collateral values are judged insufficient or other sources of repayment are deemed inadequate  the amount of reserve held is increased or the loan is reduced to estimated recoverable amounts 
as of december   substantially all of these classified loans are current with their existing repayment terms 
management believes that classification of such loans well in advance of their reaching a delinquent status allows the company the greatest flexibility in correcting problems and providing adequate reserves 
given the reserves and the demonstrated ability of the borrowers to comply with the existing repayment terms  management believes any exposure from these loans has been adequately addressed at the present time 
asset liability management asset liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring and management of interest rate risk  liquidity and funding 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for colonial s asset liability management policies 
to ensure adherence to these policies  the asset and liability committee alco establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
the guidelines apply to both on and off balance sheet positions 
the goal of the alco process is to maximize earnings while carefully controlling interest rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk  and its potential effects on earnings  are inherent in the operations of a financial institution 
we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or re price at different times for example  if assets re price faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally falling  earnings will initially decline  assets and liabilities may re price at the same time but by different amounts for example  when the general level of interest rates is falling  we may reduce rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general decline in market interest rates  short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts ie  the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently  or the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example  if long term mortgage interest rates decline sharply  mortgage backed securities held in the securities available for sale portfolio may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated which could reduce portfolio income 
in addition  interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses  mortgage origination volume  the value of the pension liability and other sources of earnings 
asset liability management activities include lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities  issuing debt and hedging interest rate risk with off balance sheet instruments 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest cost on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for off balance sheet hedges are highly correlated in a manner intended to allow colonial s interest bearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
colonial employs the following measurement techniques in the management of interest rate risk simulation of earnings and simulation of the economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
using computer modeling techniques  colonial is able to measure the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre tax earnings 
all on balance sheet positions  including derivative financial instruments  are included in the model simulation 
the following table represents the output from the company s simulation model based on the balance sheet at december   when the fed funds rate was 
the table measures the impact on net interest income of an immediate and sustained change in all market interest rates in basis point increments for the calendar months following the date of the change 
this twelve month projection of net interest income under these scenarios is compared to the twelve month net interest income projection with rates unchanged 
basis points change fed funds rate percentage change in month projected net interest income versus projected net interest income under no rate change no rate change the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  estimates of rates on loans and deposits given these rate changes  the ability to maintain interest rate floors on loans as market rates decline  deposit decay rates and loan investment prepayments 
further  the computations do not take into account changes to the slope of the yield curve  changes in the relative relationship of various market rates  changes in the volume or mix of asset and liabilities on the balance sheet nor do they contemplate any actions bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
colonial also measures interest rate risk by simulating the impact of changes in interest rates to the market value of equity 
the potential effect of these interest rate changes is derived from the impact of such changes on the market value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
colonial analyzes the changes in market value of equity to ensure that the company maintains an adequate capital position 
the following table represents the output of the simulation model for the economic value of equity eve  which is defined as the net present value of interest rate sensitive assets  interest rate sensitive liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the table represents the percentage change in the eve under basis point parallel rate shocks versus the eve assuming rates at december  and basis points change fed funds rates change in net portfolio value vs 
eve under no rate change december  december  no rate change liquidity and funding liquidity is the ability of an organization to meet its financial commitments and obligations on a timely basis 
these commitments and obligations include credit needs of customers  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due and payment of operating expenses and dividends 
management of liquidity also includes management of funding sources and their utilization based on current  future and contingency needs 
maintaining and managing adequate liquidity and funding is another prominent focus of alco 
retail deposit growth is a primary focus of bancgroup s funding and liquidity strategy 
colonial s average non time deposits grew by billion  or excluding the pcb acquisition from total deposits increased by billion  or excluding the effects of acquisitions  from december  with branches in four of the top five population growth states  retail deposits are a major component of bancgroup s funding growth 
bancgroup finished the year with internal growth in average non time deposits and of the company s non time deposits were in florida 
bancgroup has worked to expand the availability of short term and long term wholesale funding sources in addition to the emphasis on core deposit growth 
the company draws on a variety of funding sources to assist in funding loan growth  securities acquisitions and deposit fluctuations 
fed funds lines  repurchase agreements and issuances of commercial paper are sources for short term borrowings 
availability from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb is also an important part of bancgroup s wholesale funding sources 
credit facilities with the fhlb are used for both short and long term borrowings 
as of december   the lendable collateral value pledged to fhlb amounted to billion up from billion the prior year 
continued loan growth is likely to increase the lendable collateral value and the fhlb will continue to provide an important source of wholesale liquidity 
from time to time bancgroup has issued subordinated debentures  subordinated notes and trust preferred securities to provide both capital and funding 
over the course of  bancgroup focused on short term borrowings to best manage its interest rate risk and to match the short term funding requirement of mortgage warehouse lending cycles 
by year end  short term borrowings from the fhlb had increased million over short term borrowings were comprised of the following at december    and in thousands fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased repurchase agreements retail repurchase agreements wholesale commercial paper current maturity of long term debt primarily fhlb borrowings total short term borrowings additional details regarding short term borrowings excluding current maturities of long term debt are shown below maximum outstanding at any month end average balance average interest rate average interest rate at december in thousands fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased other short term borrowings fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased other short term borrowings fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased other short term borrowings long term borrowings were comprised of the following at december    and in thousands fhlb borrowings repurchase agreements long term wholesale subordinated notes trust preferred securities junior subordinated debentures variable rate subordinated debentures convertible subordinated debentures other total long term borrowings due to the adoption of fin  trust preferred securities were deconsolidated and reclassified as junior subordinated debt

operational risk management in providing banking services  colonial processes cash  checks  wires and ach transactions which expose colonial to operational risk 
controls over such processing activities are closely monitored to safeguard the assets of colonial and its customers 
however  from time to time  colonial has incurred losses related to these processes and there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur in the future 
operational risk is the risk of unexpected losses attributable to human error  systems failures  fraud  or inadequate internal controls and procedures 
this risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operational risk at levels appropriate to colonial s corporate standards in view of the risks inherent in the markets in which colonial operates 
the system of internal controls includes policies and procedures that require the proper authorization  approval  documentation and monitoring of transactions 
each business unit is responsible for complying with corporate policies and procedures to do so 
colonial s internal auditors monitor the overall effectiveness of the system of internal controls on an ongoing basis 
colonial does not engage in business processes that are out of its primary areas of expertise but rather outsources non core processing functions to limit operational risk associated with non core business 
operational losses are monitored closely 
operational losses have historically been immaterial as current earnings have absorbed operational losses without any material impact to earnings or capital 
capital management capital adequacy management is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to protect shareholders and depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
management s strategy to achieve these goals is to retain sufficient earnings while providing a reasonable return to shareholders in the form of dividends and return on equity 
the company s dividend payout ratio target range is 
dividend rates are determined by the board of directors in consideration of several factors including current and projected capital ratios  liquidity and income levels and other bank dividend yields and payment ratios 
the amount of a cash dividend  if any  rests with the discretion of the board of directors of bancgroup as well as upon applicable statutory constraints such as the delaware law requirement that dividends may be paid only out of capital surplus and net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and the preceding fiscal year 
bancgroup also has access to equity capital markets through both public and private issuances 
management considers these sources and related return in addition to internally generated capital in evaluating future expansion or acquisition opportunities 
the federal reserve board has issued guidelines identifying minimum tier i leverage ratios relative to total assets and minimum capital ratios relative to risk adjusted assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
a minimum leverage ratio of is required for all bank holding companies not meeting these criteria 
higher capital ratios may be required for any bank holding company if warranted by its particular circumstance or risk profile 
the minimum risk adjusted capital ratios established by the federal reserve are for tier i and for total capital 
bancgroup s actual capital ratios and the components of capital and risk adjusted asset information subject to regulatory review as of december  are stated below capital dollars in thousands tier i capital shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains losses on securities available for sale and intangible assets plus trust preferred securities tier ii capital allowable loan loss reserve subordinated debt of net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities total capital risk adjusted assets quarterly average assets excluding intangible assets and unrealized gains losses on securities available for sale december  december  tier i leverage ratio risk adjusted capital ratios tier i capital ratio total capital ratio due to the adoption of fin  bancgroup no longer reflects trust preferred securities on its consolidated statement of condition  but rather reflects these securities as junior subordinated debentures 
however  under current regulatory guidelines  these securities continue to qualify for tier capital treatment 
regulatory restrictions as noted previously  dividends payable by national banks in any year  without prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities  are limited 
colonial bank is also required by law to maintain noninterest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank to meet regulatory reserve requirements 
at december   these deposits were not material to bancgroup s funding requirements 
comparison of with in  we continued to expand in high growth markets  specifically florida  with the acquisition of sarasota bancorporation in october 
this acquisition added a downtown sarasota location with million in assets  million in loans and million in deposits to colonial s franchise 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
earnings per share for was  a increase over the for the previous year 
this increase reflects success in our efforts to enhance our retail banking franchise 
we achieved significant non time deposit and noninterest income growth as well as good loan growth from the regional banks 
net interest income for rose over the prior year 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for compared to for due to market rate declines and the change in mix of earning assets 
average earning assets increased  however the average yield on these assets dropped basis points to compared to in interest bearing liabilities increased while rates decreased basis points to in from in average total loans grew billion or in over the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio accounted for million of the overall increase for the record low mortgage rates available in and resulted in large increases in average loans for this division as overall mortgage activity  both refinancings and purchases  reached record levels 
on average the securities portfolio increased to billion in from billion in securities comprise of average earning assets in compared in the average yield dropped to in from in yields declined in due in part to low mortgage rates that accelerated prepayments in the portfolio and increased the premium amortization on mortgage backed investments 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points due to a lower average cost of funds in this decline was primarily the result of a shift in deposit mix to non time deposits from time deposits  increased short term borrowings  and continued repricing of deposits and other borrowings due to declines in market rates 
the percentage of average non time deposits to total average deposits has improved significantly with the ratio at in and in average non time interest bearing deposits grew  or in excluding acquisitions 
the average rate on interest bearing deposits excluding time deposits dropped basis points to for compared to for the rate on time deposits declined to an average of in compared to in average noninterest bearing deposits increased million from to  a increase excluding acquisitions 
as a result of this growth and the company s continuing effort to increase low cost or no cost deposits  the noninterest bearing deposit mix improved to of total deposits in up from in total borrowings increased in due to earning asset growth and a decline in time deposits discussed above 
the percentage of average total borrowings to average total assets was for compared to in the increase was primarily short term in nature in order to fund the short term increases in mortgage warehouse lending  mortgage loans held for sale and floating rate loan demand 
average noninterest earning assets increased million to billion from to the increase was due largely to an increase in boli and noninterest earning assets obtained through acquisitions  such as goodwill and fixed assets 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for credit quality continued to be a priority for bancgroup in at year end  nonperforming assets as a percent of net loans and ore were and net charge offs as a percent of average net loans were 
nonperforming assets were down million  or from december  the company s total allowance was million at december   which represented of period end loans compared to at december  noninterest income for the year ended was million  an increase of over primarily as the result of increases in revenues from service charges on deposit accounts  financial planning services  electronic banking services and mortgage banking of   and  respectively

industry factors as a financial services company  our earnings are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
our business and earnings are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate 
for example  an economic downturn  increase in unemployment  or other events that negatively impact household and or corporate incomes could decrease the demand for the company s loan and non loan products and services and increase the number of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans 
our earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments  both of which impact our net interest margin  and can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold  such as debt securities 
its policies also can affect our borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
changes in federal reserve board policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict or anticipate 
the financial services industry is highly competitive 
we operate in a highly competitive industry which could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can now merge by creating a relatively new type of financial services company called a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
a number of foreign banks have acquired financial services companies in the united states  further increasing competition in the us market 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures 
we are heavily regulated by federal agencies 
the holding company  its subsidiary bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated by federal agencies 
this regulation is to protect depositors  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products 
also  our failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and damage to our reputation 
for more information  refer to discussions of regulatory considerations contained in item business and note  regulatory matters and restrictions 
future legislation could change our competitive position 
various legislation  including proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system and to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies  is from time to time introduced in the congress 
this legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions  and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company or any of its subsidiaries 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties  we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
for example  in deciding whether to extend credit  we may assume that a customer s audited financial statements conform with gaap and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the customer 
we also may rely on the audit report covering those financials statements 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with gaap or that are materially misleading 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks 
for example  consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits 
company factors maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  or our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards 
there is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices 
this can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee based products and services 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet based services  could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services 
we might not successfully introduce new products and services  achieve market acceptance of our products and services  and or develop and maintain loyal customers 
the holding company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue 
the holding company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the holding company s common stock and interest and principal on its debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to the holding company 
also  the holding company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
for more information  refer to payment of dividends and other restrictions in item and note  regulatory matters and restrictions 
our accounting policies and methods determine how we report our financial condition and results of operations  and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that not only do they comply with generally accepted accounting principles but also that they reflect management s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives  any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative 
note  summary of significant accounting and reporting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies 
we have identified two accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these critical accounting policies relate to allowance for loan losses  and goodwill impairment analysis 
because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates about these matters  we cannot provide any assurance that the company will not experience results significantly different from those expected at the time of accounting for acquisitions  significantly increase its allowance for loan losses and or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the amount reserved  for more information  refer in this report to critical accounting policies 
we have businesses other than banking 
we are a diversified financial services company 
in addition to banking  we provide insurance  investments and mortgages 
although we believe our diversity helps mitigate the impact to the company when downturns affect any one segment of our industry  it also means that our earnings could be subject to different risks and uncertainties 
we discuss one example below 
mortgage warehouse retail mortgage banking the impact of interest rates on our mortgage banking business can be large and complex 
changes in interest rates can impact the company s mortgage related revenues 
a decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans as borrowers refinance  but also generally leads to accelerated payoffs 
conversely  in a constant or increasing rate environment  we would expect fewer loans to be refinanced and a decline in payoffs 
although the company uses models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgage related revenues  the estimates of net income produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand  prepayment speeds and other factors which may overstate or understate actual subsequent experience 
we have an active acquisition program 
we regularly explore opportunities to acquire financial institutions and other financial services providers 
we cannot predict the number  size or timing of future acquisitions 
we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition or business combination until we have signed a definitive agreement for the transaction 
our ability to successfully complete an acquisition generally is subject to regulatory approval  and we cannot be certain when or if  or on what terms and conditions  any required regulatory approvals will be granted 
we might be required to divest banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval 
difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from the acquisition 
specifically  the integration process could result in higher than expected deposit attrition run off  loss of key employees  the disruption of our business or the business of the acquired company  or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
also  the negative impact of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in connection with acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected 
our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the company can be intense 
we may not be able to hire people or to keep them 
our stock price can be volatile 
our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  new technology used  or services offered  by our competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors  failure to integrate our acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  changes in government regulations  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  also could cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results
