energy services overview the energy services segment includes companies that provide energy related services to customers primarily located within the northeastern united states  with concentrations in the new york city and boston metropolitan areas through the following two lines of business i home energy services  which provides residential customers and small commercial customers with installation  service and maintenance of energy systems and appliances  and ii business solutions  which provides energy related operation and maintenance  design  engineering and consulting services to commercial and industrial customers 
the energy services segment has more than  employees and approximately  service contracts  and is the number one oil to gas conversion contractor in new york and new england 
keyspan s energy services subsidiaries compete with local  regional and national hvac  engineering  and independent energy companies  in addition to electric utilities  independent power producers and local distribution companies 
competition is based largely upon pricing  availability and reliability of supply  technical and financial capabilities  regional presence  experience and customer service 
as a result of an extremely competitive market and sluggish economic conditions within the construction industry in the northeastern united states  the energy services segment has experienced significantly lower operating profits and cash flows than originally projected 
as previously reported  management has been reviewing the operating performance of this segment 
in november  keyspan s board of directors authorized management to begin the process of disposing of a significant portion of its ownership interests in certain companies within the energy services segment specifically those companies engaged in mechanical contracting activities 
in the first quarter of  the company divested all of its mechanical contracting subsidiaries 
for additional information concerning the energy services segment  see the discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations energy services contained herein 
energy investments overview we are also engaged in energy investments which include i gas exploration and production activities  ii domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities  iii natural gas pipeline activities in the united kingdom  and iv certain other domestic energy related investments  such as the transportation by truck of liquid natural gas 
gas exploration and production keyspan is engaged in the exploration for and production of domestic natural gas and oil through wholly owned subsidiaries seneca upshur petroleum  inc  d b a keyspan production development company seneca upshur and keyspan exploration and production  llc keyspan exploration and production

in june  keyspan reduced its ownership in houston exploration from to  through an exchange of million shares of its houston exploration common stock for of the stock of seneca upshur  previously a wholly owned subsidiary of houston exploration 
seneca upshur s assets consist of billion cubic feet of low risk  mature  onshore gas producing properties located predominantly in west virginia and pennsylvania 
in november  keyspan decided to sell its remaining ownership interest approximately million shares of common stock in houston exploration 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations energy investments for a further discussion of these matters 
as indicated above  as a result of the transactions with houston exploration  seneca upshur  headquartered in buckhannon  west virginia  owns and operates onshore gas producing properties  and operates approximately  wells in north central west virginia and southern pennsylvania 
to manage the inherent volatility in commodity prices  seneca upshur entered into a three year hedge for a majority of its production at favorable prices 
as previously indicated  keyspan exploration and production is engaged in a joint venture with houston exploration to explore for and produce natural gas and oil 
houston exploration contributed all of its undeveloped offshore leases to the joint venture for a working interest  and keyspan exploration and production acquired a working interest in all prospects to be drilled by the joint venture 
effective  the joint venture was modified to reflect that keyspan exploration and production would only participate in the development of wells that had previously been drilled and not participate in future exploration prospects 
in line with our stated strategy of exploring the monetization or divestiture of certain non core assets  in october  keyspan exploration and production sold its interest in the gas producing assets in the joint venture drilling program to houston exploration 
keyspan exploration and production s remaining joint venture assets are primarily proved undeveloped oil reserves located off the gulf of mexico in the south timbalier and mustang island areas 
domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities we own a interest in iroquois gas transmission system lp  the partnership that owns a mile pipeline that can bring up to  dth per day of canadian gas supply from the new york canadian border to markets in the northeastern united states

applications for all necessary regulatory authorizations were filed in and islander east has received a final certificate from the ferc and all necessary permits from the state of new york 
the state of connecticut denied islander east s applications for coastal zone management and section of the clean water act authorizations 
islander east appealed the state of connecticut s determination on the coastal zone management issue to the united states department of commerce 
on may   the department of commerce overrode connecticut s denial and granted the coastal zone management authorization 
islander east s petition for a declaratory order challenging the denial of the section authorization is pending with connecticut s state superior court 
once in service  the pipeline is expected to transport up to  dth daily to the long island and new york city energy markets  enough natural gas to heat  homes 
the pipeline will also allow keyspan to diversify the geographic sources of its gas supply 
various options for the financing of this pipeline construction are currently being evaluated 
as of december   keyspan s total capitalized costs associated with the siting and permitting of the islander east pipeline were approximately million 
in august  keyspan acquired a interest in the millennium pipeline development project is anticipated to transport up to  dth of natural gas a day from corning to ramapo  new york  where it will connect to the algonquin pipeline 
the other partners in the millennium pipeline are dte energy  columbia gas transmission corp  a unit of nisource incorporated 
the project has been approved by the ferc and  pending an amendment to the project s ferc certificate  construction could begin as early as the third quarter of  with service beginning as early as november the millennium pipeline will provide keyspan with new  competitively priced supplies of natural gas from canada 
further  the project will increase keyspan s access to gas storage in the great lakes region  adding critical flexibility to keyspan s gas supply  while helping to control price volatility based on weather conditions 
once constructed  keyspan plans to purchase  dth per day from the millennium pipeline system  which represents approximately of new york city s peak day requirements

environmental matters overview keyspan s ordinary business operations subject it to regulation in accordance with various federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations dealing with the environment  including air  water  and hazardous substances 
these requirements govern both our normal  ongoing operations and the remediation of impacted properties historically used in utility operations 
potential liability associated with our historical operations may be imposed without regard to fault  even if the activities were lawful at the time they occurred 
except as set forth below  or in note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters  no material proceedings relating to environmental matters have been commenced or  to our knowledge  are contemplated by any federal  state or local agency against keyspan  and we are not a defendant in any material litigation with respect to any matter relating to the protection of the environment 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and that requirements imposed by existing environmental laws are not likely to have a material adverse impact upon us 
we are also pursuing claims against insurance carriers and potentially responsible parties which seek the recovery of certain environmental costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties 
we believe that investigation and remediation costs prudently incurred at facilities associated with utility operations  not recoverable through insurance or some other means  will be recoverable from our customers in accordance with the terms of our rate recovery agreements for each regulated subsidiary 
air 
the federal clean air act caa provides for the regulation of a variety of air emissions from new and existing electric generating plants 
final permits in accordance with the requirements of title v of the amendments to the caa have been issued for all of our electric generating facilities  with the exception of two mw simple cycle gas turbine facilities which were constructed in these units currently are permitted under new york state facility permits and title v permits have been timely applied for and are pending issuance by the nysdec 
renewal applications have been submitted in a timely manner for existing facilities whose initial permits were to expire in to date  five of the permits were renewed and the remaining renewal applications  although in various stages of the regulatory process  are deemed completed by dec 
in addition  three permit modifications were also submitted and approved 
the permits and timely renewal applications allow our electric generating plants to continue to operate without any additional significant expenditures  except as described below 
our generating facilities are located within a caa severe ozone non attainment area  and are subject to phase i  ii and iii nox reduction requirements established under the ozone transport commission otc memorandum of understanding 
our investments in low nox boiler combustion modifications and the use of natural gas firing systems at our steam electric generating stations have enabled us to achieve the emission reductions required under phase i  ii and iii of the otc memorandum in a cost effective manner 
we have achieved and expect to continue to achieve such emission reductions in a cost effective manner through the use of low nox combustion control systems  the use of natural gas fuel and or the purchases of emission allowances when necessary 
capital expenditures were incurred between million and million for combustion control systems and natural gas fuel capability additions over the last several years to enhance compliance options 
in  new york state promulgated regulations which establish separate nox and so emission reduction requirements on electric generating facilities in new york state beginning in late for nox emissions and in for so emissions 
keyspan s facilities are expected to comply with the nox requirements without material additional capital expenditures because of previously installed emissions control equipment and gas combustion capability 
so compliance is expected to require a reduction in the sulfur content of the fuel oil used in our northport and port jefferson facilities 
in december  the united states environmental protection agency usepa issued draft regulations that would require reductions of mercury and nickel as well as further reductions of nox and so from electric generating facilities on a national basis 
the proposed mercury regulations would have no impact on keyspan facilities since their application is limited to coal fired plants 
the proposed nickel  nox and so reduction requirements  if finalized as drafted  could require additional expenditures for emission control systems or greater use of natural gas in order to facilitate compliance 
until these regulations are finalized  the nature and extent of the financial impact on keyspan  if any  cannot be determined 
in  the governor of new york initiated a regional greenhouse gas initiative that seeks to establish a coordinated multistate plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions primarily carbon dioxide co from electric generating emission sources in the northeast 
several congressional initiatives are also under consideration that may also require greenhouse gas reductions from electric generating facilities nationwide 
at the present time  it is not possible to predict the nature of the requirements which ultimately will be imposed on keyspan  nor what  if any  financial impact such requirements would have on keyspan facilities 
however  our investments in additional natural gas firing capability have resulted in approximately a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions since  while the electric generation industry as a whole increased carbon dioxide emissions by more than 
the addition of the efficient  combined cycle unit which began operation at ravenswood in will further reduce average keyspan co emission rates 
water 
the federal clean water act provides for effluent limitations  to be implemented by a permit system  to regulate the discharge of pollutants into united states waters 
we possess permits for our generating units which authorize discharges from cooling water circulating systems and chemical treatment systems 
these permits are renewed from time to time  as required by regulation 
additional capital expenditures associated with the renewal of the surface water discharge permits for our power plants will likely be required by the dec 
we are currently conducting studies as directed by the dec to determine the impacts of our discharges on aquatic resources 
it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of such capital investments since they will depend upon the outcome of the ongoing studies and the subsequent determination by the dec to apply the standards set forth in recently promulgated federal regulations under section of the clean water act designed to mitigate such impacts 
land 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of and certain similar state laws collectively superfund impose liability  regardless of fault  upon generators of hazardous substances even before superfund was enacted for costs associated with remediating contaminated property 
in the course of our business operations  we generate materials which  after disposal  may become subject to superfund 
from time to time  we have received notices under superfund concerning possible claims with respect to sites where hazardous substances generated by keyspan or its predecessors and other potentially responsible parties were allegedly disposed 
normally  the costs associated with such claims are allocated among the potentially responsible parties on a pro rata basis 
the cost of these claims is not presently determinable 
superfund does  however  provide for joint and several liability against a single potentially responsible party 
in the unlikely event that superfund claims were pursued against us on that basis  the costs may be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
keyspan has identified certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites which were historically owned or operated by its subsidiaries or such companies predecessors 
operations at these sites between the mid s to mid s may have resulted in the release of hazardous substances 
for a discussion on our mgp sites and further information concerning environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters 
competition  regulation and rate matters competition 
over the last several years  the natural gas and electric industries have undergone significant change as market forces moved towards replacing or supplementing rate regulation through the introduction of competition 
a significant number of natural gas and electric utilities reacted to the changing structure of the energy industry by entering into business combinations  with the goal of reducing common costs  gaining size to better withstand competitive pressures and business cycles  and attaining synergies from the combination of operations 
we engaged in two such combinations  the keyspan lilco transaction in and our november acquisition of eastern and energynorth 
for further information regarding the gas and electric industry  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment 
ravenswood  the merchant plant in our electric services segment  is subject to competitive and other risks that could adversely impact the market price for the plant s output 
such risks include  but are not limited to  the construction of new generation or transmission capacity serving the new york city market 
however  we cannot predict when or if new generation or transmission capacity will be built 
additionally  our non utility subsidiaries engaged in the energy services business compete with other hvac and engineering companies  and in new jersey are faced with competition from the regulated utilities that are still able to offer appliance repair and protection services 
regulation 
public utility holding companies  like keyspan  are regulated by the sec under puhca and to some extent by state utility commissions through the regulation of corporate  financial and affiliate activities of public utilities 
our utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation by state utility commissions  ferc and the sec 
our gas and electric public utility companies are subject to either or both state and federal regulation 
in general  state public utility commissions  such as the new york public service commission nypsc  the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte and the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc regulate the provision of retail services  including the distribution and sale of natural gas and electricity to consumers 
each of the federal and state regulators also regulates certain transactions among our affiliates 
ferc regulates interstate natural gas transportation and electric transmission  and has jurisdiction over certain wholesale natural gas sales and wholesale electric sales 
in addition  our non utility subsidiaries are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations with respect to their business activities  including but not limited to those affecting public sector projects  environmental and labor laws and regulations  state licensing requirements  as well as state laws and regulations concerning the competitive retail commodity supply 
state utility commissions 
our regulated gas distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the nypsc  dte and nhpuc 
the nypsc regulates kedny and kedli 
although keyspan corporation is not regulated by the nypsc  it is impacted by conditions that were included in the nypsc order authorizing the keyspan lilco transaction 
those conditions address  among other things  the manner in which keyspan  its service company subsidiaries and its unregulated subsidiaries may interact with kedny and kedli 
the nypsc also regulates the safety  reliability and certain financial transactions of our long island generating facilities and our ravenswood generating facility under a lightened regulatory standard 
our kedne subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the dte and nhpuc 
our energy services subsidiary which engages in the retail sale of electricity is subject to certain regulations of the nypsc 
for further information regarding the state regulatory commissions  see the discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulation and rate matters 
federal energy regulatory commission 
ferc regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as well as certain corporate and financial activities of companies that are engaged in such activities 
the long island generating facilities and the ravenswood facility are subject to ferc regulation based on their wholesale energy transactions 
in  lipa  keyspan and the staff of ferc stipulated to a five year rate plan for the long island generating facilities with agreed upon yearly adjustments  which have been approved by ferc 
these ferc approved rates expired on december  a rate filing reflecting a recalculated revenue requirement was submitted to ferc on october  on october  ferc approved a settlement reached between keyspan and lipa with respect to new rates and certain other costs and expenses 
pursuant to the ferc approved settlement  keyspan rates reflect a cost of equity of with no revenue increase 
ferc also approved updated operating and maintenance expense levels and keyspan s recovery of certain other costs as agreed to by the parties 
our ravenswood facility s rates are based on a market based rate application approved by ferc 
the rates that our ravenswood facility may charge are subject to mitigation measures due to market power concerns of ferc 
the mitigation measures are administered by the nyiso 
ferc retains the ability in future proceedings  either on its own motion or upon a complaint filed with ferc  to modify the ravenswood facility s rates  as well as the mitigation measures  if ferc concludes that it is in the public interest to do so 
keyspan currently offers and sells the energy  capacity and ancillary services from the ravenswood facility through the energy market operated by the nyiso 
for information concerning the nyiso  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment 
ferc also has jurisdiction to regulate certain natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce  the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and  unless an exemption applies  companies engaged in such activities 
the natural gas distribution activities of kedny  kedli  kedne and certain related intrastate gas transportation functions are not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  to the extent that kedny  kedli or kedne purchase or sell gas for resale in interstate commerce  such transactions are subject to ferc jurisdiction and have been authorized by ferc 
our interests in iroquois  honeoye  steuben and keyspan lng are also fully regulated by ferc as natural gas companies 
securities and exchange commission 
as a result of the acquisition of eastern and energynorth  we became a registered holding company under puhca 
therefore  our corporate and financial activities and those of our subsidiaries  including their ability to pay dividends to us  are subject to regulation by the sec 
under our holding company structure  we have no independent operations or source of income of our own and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and  as a result  we depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operations of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities 
for additional information concerning regulation by the sec under puhca  see the discussion under the heading securities and exchange commission regulation contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
in addition  in november  keyspan received authorization from the sec to operate three mutual service companies 
under this order  the sec determined that  in accordance with puhca  keyspan corporate services llc kcs  keyspan utility services llc kus and keyspan engineering survey  inc keng may operate to provide various services to keyspan subsidiaries  including regulated utility companies and lipa  at cost fairly and equitably allocated among them 
risks related to our business we are a holding company  and we and our subsidiaries are subject to federal and or state regulation which limits our financial activities  including the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to us we are a holding company registered under puhca with no business operations or sources of income of our own 
we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries and depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 
because we are a registered holding company  our corporate and financial activities and those of our subsidiaries  including their ability to pay dividends to us from unearned surplus  are subject to puhca and regulation by the sec 
in addition  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by the utility regulatory commissions of new york  massachusetts and new hampshire 
pursuant to nypsc orders  the ability of kedny and kedli to pay dividends to us is conditioned upon their maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under a customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s rate years september  and november   respectively  their ratios of debt to total utility capitalization were well in compliance with the ratios set forth above and we have incurred no penalties under the outstanding customer service performance program 
puhca also limits our business operations and our ability to affiliate with other utilities in addition to limiting our financial activities  puhca also limits our operations to a single integrated utility system  plus additional energy related businesses  regulates transactions between us and our subsidiaries and requires sec approval for specified utility mergers and acquisitions 
our gas distribution and electric services businesses may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state regulation the regulatory environment applicable to our gas distribution and our electric services businesses has undergone substantial changes in recent years  on both the federal and state levels 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the gas and electric utility and power industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities and future changes in laws and regulations may affect our gas distribution and our electric services businesses in ways that we cannot predict 
in addition  our operations are subject to extensive government regulation and require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
a significant portion of our revenues in our gas distribution and electric services segments are directly dependent on rates established by federal or state regulatory authorities  and any change in these rates and regulatory structure could significantly impact our financial results 
increases in utility costs other than gas  not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses  could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses in rates 
various rulemaking proposals and market design revisions related to the wholesale power market are being reviewed at the federal level 
these proposals  as well as legislative and other attention to the electric power industry could have a material adverse effect on our strategies and results of operations for our electric services business and our financial condition 
in particular  we sell power and energy from our ravenswood generating facility into the new york independent system operator  or nyiso  energy market at market based rates  subject to mitigation measures approved by the ferc 
the pricing for both energy sales and services to the nyiso energy market is still evolving and some of the ferc s price mitigation measures are subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
our risk mitigation techniques such as hedging and purchase of insurance may not adequately provide protection to mitigate our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  keyspan routinely enters into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments  weather fluctuations  electricity sales  natural gas supply and other commodities 
however  we do not always cover the entire exposure of our assets or our positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time 
to the extent we have unhedged positions or our hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could cause our sales and net income to be volatile 
in addition  our business is subject to many hazards from which our insurance may not adequately provide coverage 
an unexpected outage of ravenswood  especially in the significant summer period  could materially impact our financial results 
damage to pipelines  equipment  properties and people caused by natural disasters  accidents  terrorism or other damage by third parties could exceed our insurance coverage 
although we do have insurance to protect against many of these contingent liabilities  this insurance is capped at certain levels  has self insured retentions and does not provide coverage for all liabilities 
sec rules for exploration and production companies may require us to recognize a non cash impairment charge at the end of our reporting periods our investments in natural gas and oil consist of our ownership of keyspan exploration and production and seneca upshur 
we use the full cost method for keyspan exploration and production and seneca upshur 
under the full cost method  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on production and proved reserve quantities 
to the extent that these capitalized costs  net of accumulated depletion  less deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  those excess costs are charged to operations 
if a write down is required  it would result in a charge to earnings but would not have an impact on cash flows 
once incurred  an impairment of gas properties is not reversible at a later date  even if gas prices increase 
our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis our gas distribution business is a seasonal business and is subject to weather conditions 
we receive most of our gas distribution revenues in the first and fourth quarters  when demand for natural gas increases due to colder weather conditions 
as a result  we are subject to seasonal variations in working capital because we purchase natural gas supplies for storage in the second and third quarters and must finance these purchases 
accordingly  our results of operations fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  our new england based gas distribution subsidiaries do not have weather normalization tariffs  as we do in new york  and results from our ravenswood generating facility are directly correlated to the weather as the demand and price for the electricity it generates increases during extreme temperature conditions 
as a result  fluctuations in weather between years may have a significant effect on our results of operations for these subsidiaries 
we cannot predict whether lipa will exercise its option to purchase our long island generating assets and the effect of that purchase on us under the gpra  lipa has the right to purchase  at fair market value  during the six month period beginning november   our interest in keyspan generation llc 
lipa is in the process of performing a long term strategic review initiative regarding its future direction 
it has engaged a team of advisors and consultants and is conducting public hearings to develop recommendations to be submitted to the lipa trustees 
some of the strategic options that lipa is considering is whether it should continue its operations as they presently exist  fully municipalize or fully privatize  sell some  but not all of its assets and become a regulator of rates and services  or merge with one or more utilities 
until lipa makes a determination on its future direction  we are unable to determine what the impact will be on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from our agreements with lipa  and no assurance can be made that these arrangements will be renewed at the end of their terms or that the resolution of certain disputes will not materially impact our financial condition we derive a substantial portion of our revenues in our electric services segment from a number of agreements with lipa pursuant to which we manage lipa s transmission and distribution system and supply the majority of lipa s customers electricity needs 
the agreements terminate at various dates between may  and may   and at this time  we can provide no assurance that any of the agreements will be renewed or extended  or if they were to be renewed or extended  the terms and conditions thereof 
in addition  given the complexity of these arrangements  disputes arise from time to time between keyspan and lipa concerning the rights and obligations of each party to make and receive payments as required pursuant to the terms of these agreements 
as a result  we are unable to determine what effect  if any  the ultimate resolution of these disputes will have on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flow 
a decline or an otherwise negative change in the ratings or outlook on our securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms the credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities regularly review our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurances that the ratings or outlook on our debt securities will not be reduced or otherwise negatively changed 
a negative change in the ratings or outlook on our debt securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms 
our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant  and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect us our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources and the health and safety of our employees 
these environmental laws and regulations expose us to costs and liabilities relating to our operations and our current and formerly owned properties 
compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment and permits at our facilities 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  and in particular emission regulations  could have a material impact on our electric services segment and our results of operations and financial position  especially if emission limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated or the number and type of electric generating plants we operate increase 
in addition  we are responsible for the clean up of contamination at certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites and at other sites and are aware of additional mgp sites where we may have responsibility for clean up costs 
while our gas utility subsidiaries rate plans generally allow for the full recovery of the costs of investigation and remediation of most of our mgp sites  these rate recovery mechanisms may change in the future 
to the extent rate recovery mechanisms change in the future  or if additional environmental matters arise in the future at our currently or historically owned facilities  at sites we may acquire in the future or at third party waste disposal sites  costs associated with investigating and remediating these sites could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our businesses are subject to competition and general economic conditions impacting demand for services we recently expanded the ravenswood facility  our merchant generation plant  in our electric services segment with the ravenswood expansion  a mw combined cycle generating unit 
however  the ravenswood facility and ravenswood expansion continue to be subject to competition that could adversely impact the market price for the electricity they produce 
if new generation and or transmission facilities are constructed  and or the availability of our ravenswood facility deteriorates  then the capacity and energy sales quantities could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict  however  when or if new power plants or transmission facilities will be built or the nature of the future new york city energy requirements 
competition facing our unregulated energy services businesses  including but not limited to competition from other heating  ventilation and air conditioning  and engineering companies  as well as  other utilities and utility holding companies that are permitted to engage in such activities  could adversely impact our financial results and the value of those businesses  resulting in decreased earnings as well as write downs of the carrying value of those businesses 
our gas distribution segment faces competition with distributors of alternative fuels and forms of energy  including fuel oil and propane 
our ability to continue to add new gas distribution customers may significantly impact financial results 
the gas distribution industry has experienced a decrease in consumption per customer over time  partially due to increased efficiency of customers appliances  economic factors and price elasticity 
in addition  our gas distribution segment s future growth is dependent upon the ability to add new customers to our system in a cost effective manner 
while our long island and new england utilities have significant growth potential  we cannot be sure new customers will continue to offset the decrease in consumption of our existing customer base 
there are a number of factors outside of our control that impact customer conversions from an alternative fuel to gas  including general economic factors impacting customers willingness to invest in new gas equipment 
employee matters as of december   keyspan and its wholly owned subsidiaries had approximately  employees 
of that total  approximately  employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements 
keyspan has not experienced any work stoppage during the past five years and considers its relationship with employees  including those covered by collective bargaining agreements  to be good 
prior to their expiration in february  keyspan reached tentative agreements with ibew locals and on new collective bargaining agreements 
these unions represent keyspan employees in physical and clerical positions respectively  and serve our long island customers 
the new four year agreements were ratified by each respective union before the end of march executive officers of the company

keyspan s financial results for the year ended december  and reflect the following items that had a significant impact on comparative results i non core asset sales recorded in both and  ii impairment charges recorded in  and iii debt redemption charges recorded in both and during  keyspan sold its interest in the houston exploration company houston exploration an independent natural gas and oil exploration and production company located in houston  texas 
we received cash proceeds of approximately million in two stock transactions and recorded after tax gains of million  or per share 
also in  keyspan sold its remaining ownership interest in keyspan canada previously a owned subsidiary with natural gas processing plants and gathering facilities in western canada 
we received cash proceeds of approximately million in two transactions and recorded after tax gains of million  or per share 
combined  these asset sales provided keyspan with approximately billion of cash proceeds and after tax earnings of million  or per share 
as mentioned  during keyspan completed two non core asset sales 
in  keyspan sold of its interest in keyspan canada 
additionally  we sold our interest in taylor ngl lp that owns and operates two extraction plants also located in canada 
we recorded an after tax loss of million  or per share  associated with these sales 
additionally  we reduced our ownership interest in houston exploration from to approximately following the repurchase  by houston exploration  of three million shares of common stock owned by keyspan 
we recorded a gain of million  or per share  on this transaction 
income taxes were not provided on this transaction since the transaction was structured as a return of capital 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our interest in phoenix natural gas  a natural gas distribution company located in northern ireland  and recorded an after tax gain of million  or per share 
in total  keyspan recorded a pre tax gain of million from the monetization of these non core assets 
the combined after tax gain from these asset sales was minimal due to the tax treatment associated with each transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements business segments and the discussions under the caption review of operating segments for a more detailed discussion of each of the above noted non core stock transactions 
keyspan recorded three significant impairment charges during a goodwill impairment charge recorded in the energy services segment  as well as a ceiling test write down and carrying value impairment charge recorded in the energy investment segment that resulted in after tax charges to continuing operations of million  or per share 
the energy services segment recorded an after tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  or per share in continuing operations as a result of an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in this segment 
based upon the operating results experienced by the energy services segment and management s opinion that it was likely that a significant portion of the energy services segment would be sold within one year  keyspan conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of its investments in this segment  including recorded goodwill 
that evaluation resulted in a total impairment charge of million after tax  or per share million of this charge is attributable to continuing operations  while the remaining million  or per share  has been reflected in discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for additional details on this charge 
keyspan s wholly owned gas exploration and production subsidiaries recorded an after tax non cash impairment charge of million  or per share  to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements gas exploration and production property depletion for additional details on this transaction 
in addition to the asset sales noted previously  keyspan has entered into an agreement to sell its interest in premier transmission limited ptl  a gas pipeline from southwest scotland to northern ireland  before the end of the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of keyspan recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million million after tax or per share  reflecting the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of ptl compared to its carrying value 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the energy investments segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements business segments and the discussions under the caption review of operating segments for a more detailed discussion of the anticipated sale 
the remaining significant item noted above is debt redemption costs incurred in and in  keyspan redeemed approximately million of outstanding long term debt 
keyspan incurred million in call premiums associated with this redemption  of which was expensed and recorded in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
the remaining amount of the call premiums have been deferred for future recovery 
further  keyspan wrote off million of previously deferred financing costs which have been reflected in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income 
the total after tax expense of the debt redemption was million or per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt and commercial paper as well as the discussion under the caption financing for additional details on this transaction 
in  keyspan incurred million in debt redemption costs associated with the redemption of approximately million of outstanding promissory notes that were issued to the long island power authority lipa in connection with the keyspan long island lighting company lilco business combination completed in may further  houston exploration  then a consolidated subsidiary  incurred debt redemption costs of million  to retire million notes 
the total after tax expense of the debt redemptions in was million or per share 
the net impact of the above mentioned items resulted in an increase to earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million or per share in the remaining items impacting comparative earnings from continuing operations reflect higher earnings from the gas distribution segment  primarily due to a boston gas company rate increase resulting from a rate proceeding concluded in november  partially offset by the adverse effect on earnings from keyspan s lower ownership level in houston exploration 
as mentioned above and discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements business segments  during the first half of keyspan maintained an approximate ownership level in houston exploration 
in june  keyspan s ownership decreased to approximately and then in november keyspan decided to sell its remaining investment 
earnings available for common stock vs earnings available for common stock for the year ended december  also includes losses from discontinued operations 
as noted  at december   keyspan intended to sell a significant portion of its ownership interest in certain companies within the energy services segment specifically those companies engaged in mechanical contracting activities 
as a result  keyspan recorded a loss in discontinued operations of million  or per share 
this loss reflects the million after tax impairment charges to reflect a reduction to the carrying value of assets associated with mechanical contracting activities and operating losses of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for additional details on these items 
earnings available for common stock for the year ended december  have been reclassified to reflect an operating loss from discontinued operations of million  or per share associated with the operations of the mechanical contracting activities 
earnings available for common stock also include a charge for a cumulative change in accounting principle 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation number fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation required us to  among other things  consolidate the ravenswood master lease the lease under which keyspan leases and operates a portion of the ravenswood electric generating facility ravenswood facility and classify the lease obligation as long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet starting december  as a result of implementing fin  we recognized a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share related to catch up depreciation of the facility since its acquisition in june and recorded the charge as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for an explanation of the leasing arrangement for the ravenswood facility  as well as an explanation of the implementation of fin earnings from continuing operations vs income from continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends  increased million in compared to primarily reflecting higher earnings from the energy investments and gas distribution segments 
the energy investment segment benefited from higher earnings associated with gas exploration and production activities as a result of significantly higher realized gas prices and higher production volumes 
the gas distribution segment benefited from colder weather during the january through march heating season compared to the same period of  as well as from load growth 
further  during we recorded million in gains from property sales  primarily acres of real property located on long island 
earnings per share from continuing operations increased only per share  reflecting the issuance of million shares of common stock on january   as well as the re issuance of shares held in treasury pursuant to dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans 
the increase in average common shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by compared to earnings available for common stock vs as mentioned  earnings available for common stock for the year ended december   reflects an operating loss from discontinued operations of million  or per share associated with the operations of the mechanical contracting activities  as well as a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share related to the implementation of fin earnings available for common stock for the year ended december  includes a net loss of million  or per share  from discontinued operations 
the mechanical contracting operations reflected earnings of million  or per share in discontinued operations 
this was offset by an after tax loss of million associated with the sale of midland enterprises llc midland 
in january  keyspan announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell midland  its marine barge business 
during the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of this divestiture  which closed on july   an estimated loss on the sale of midland was recorded as discontinued operations  as well as an estimate for midland s results of operations for the first nine months of in the second quarter of  we recorded an additional after tax loss of million  primarily reflecting a provision for certain city and state taxes that resulted from a change in our tax structuring strategy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements discontinued midland operations for additional information 
consolidated summary of results operating income by segment  as well as consolidated earnings available for common stock is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars  except per share amounts gas distribution    electric services    energy services operations    goodwill impairment charge  energy investments operations    ceiling test write down and impairment charge  eliminations and other    operating income    interest charges    gain on houston exploration transactions   gain loss on sale of keyspan canada   gain on sale of phoenix natural gas  cost of debt redemption   other income and deductions   income taxes    income from continuing operations    cumulative change in accounting principles  loss from discontinued operations   net income    preferred stock dividend requirements    earnings for common stock    basic earnings per share continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends change in accounting principles discontinued operations operating income  as indicated in the above table  decreased million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of comparative operating income was adversely impacted by lower operating income from the energy investment segment as a result of keyspan s reduced ownership interest in houston exploration and keyspan canada during the latter half of in addition  operating income in the energy investments segment was adversely impacted by the million non cash impairment charge to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves  as well as the million non cash impairment charge in our investment in ptl 
further  the decrease in operating income reflects the million non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the energy services segment 
the higher comparative operating income in the electric services segment in primarily reflects higher net electric margins associated with the ravenswood expansion  a recently constructed mw combined cycle generating facility located at the ravenswood facility site 
the gas distribution segment benefited from customer additions and oil to gas conversions throughout our service territories  as well as from the full effect of the rate increase resulting from the boston gas company rate proceeding concluded in november as mentioned earlier  in we recorded million in gains from property sales  primarily acres of real property located on long island  that were recorded in the gas distribution segment 
see the discussion under the caption review of operating segments for further details on each segment 
the increase in interest expense of million  or  in  compared to the prior year  reflects a number of items 
as noted earlier  interest expense for includes the write off of million of previously deferred issuance costs as a result of the redemption of million of outstanding long term debt 
in addition  interest expense in was impacted by the implementation of fin  mentioned earlier 
beginning january   lease payments associated with the ravenswood master lease have been reflected as interest expense on the consolidated statement of income resulting in an increase to interest expense of approximately million in see note contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for further information on the master lease 
further  comparative interest expense also reflects the benefits realized in associated with interest rate swaps 
in  we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
this swap was used to hedge a portion of outstanding promissory notes that were issued to lipa in connection with the keyspan lilco business combination 
as noted previously  in march  we called approximately million of the outstanding promissory notes  and settled the outstanding derivative instrument 
the cash proceeds from the termination of the interest rate hedge were million  of which million represented accrued swap interest 
the difference between the termination settlement amount and the amount of accrued swap interest  million  was recorded to earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in and effectively offset a portion of the redemption charges 
offsetting  to some extent  these adverse impacts to comparative interest expense are the benefits associated with a lower level of outstanding long term debt 
in addition to the asset sales of million and debt redemption costs of million previously noted  other income and deductions for reflects a million gain recorded on the settlement of a derivative financial instrument entered into in connection with the sale leaseback transaction associated with the ravenswood expansion  as well as a million foreign currency gain on cash investments held off shore 
other income and deductions also includes the effects of minority interest of million related to our previous controlling interests in houston exploration and keyspan canada  as well as carrying charges on certain regulatory assets 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies and hedging and derivative financial instruments  for additional information regarding the sale leaseback transaction and derivative financial instrument 
in addition to the asset sales of million and debt redemption costs of million previously noted  other income and deductions in also reflects severance tax refunds totaling million recorded by houston exploration for severance taxes paid in and earlier periods  as well as million of realized foreign currency translation gains 
finally  other income and deductions reflects minority interest adjustments related to houston exploration and keyspan canada of million  as well as carrying charges on certain regulatory assets 
income tax expense generally reflects the level of pre tax income 
in addition  tax expense for reflects i a million benefit resulting from a revised appraisal associated with property that was disposed of in  ii a tax benefit of million related to the repatriation of earnings from keyspan s canadian investments  and iii the beneficial tax treatment afforded the stock transaction with houston exploration 
income tax expense for includes a number of items impacting comparative results 
during  the partial monetization of our canadian investments resulted in tax expense of million  reflecting certain united states partnership tax rules 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment to income tax expense of million due to the commonwealth of massachusetts disallowing the carry forward of net operating losses incurred by regulated utilities 
offsetting  to some extent  these increases to tax expense  was a tax benefit recorded in of million associated with certain new york city general corporation tax issues 
in addition  certain costs associated with employee deferred compensation plans were deducted for federal income tax purposes in these costs  however  are not expensed for book purposes resulting in a beneficial permanent book to tax difference of million 
as noted earlier  earnings available for common stock for the year ended december  also includes losses of million  or per share  from discontinued operations 
earnings available for common stock for the year ended december  includes a charge for a cumulative change in accounting principles of million  or per share  associated with the implementation of fin  as well as operating losses of million  or per share associated with discontinued operations 
as a result of the items discussed above  earnings available for common stock were million  or per share for the year ended december  compared to million  or per share realized in operating income in increased million compared to this increase in operating income reflects higher earnings from the energy investments and gas distribution segments  somewhat offset by a decrease in earnings from the electric services segment 
the energy investment segment benefited from higher earnings associated with gas exploration and production activities as a result of significantly higher realized gas prices and higher production volumes 
the gas distribution segment benefited from colder weather during the january through march heating season compared to the same period of  as well as from load growth 
further  as mentioned earlier  during we recorded million in gains in the gas distribution segment from property sales 
lower results from the electric services segment were attributable to higher operating costs  as well as lower revenues from our merchant generating facility  due in part to cooler summer weather in see the discussion under the caption review of operating segments for further details on each segment 
interest charges increased in  compared to  primarily as a result of the absence of the benefits associated with certain interest rate derivative swap instruments that were in effect in  but terminated in see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values 
as discussed in greater detail earlier  other income and deductions in reflects a number of significant items that impacted comparative results 
during  we monetized a portion of our canadian and northern ireland investments  as well as a portion of our ownership interest in houston exploration and recorded a net gain of million associated with these transactions 
further  we incurred debt redemption costs of million 
other income and deductions in also reflects severance tax refunds totaling million recorded by houston exploration for severance taxes paid in and earlier periods  compared to million recorded in  as well as million of realized foreign currency translation gains 
finally  other income and deductions for both and reflects minority interest adjustments related to houston exploration and keyspan canada  as well as carrying charges on certain regulatory assets 
the increase in income tax expense in compared to generally reflects a higher level of pre tax earnings 
further  income tax expense for and includes a number of items impacting comparative results 
as mentioned above  the partial monetization of our canadian investments in resulted in tax expense of million  reflecting certain united states partnership tax rules 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment to income tax expense of million due to the commonwealth of massachusetts disallowing the carry forward of net operating losses incurred by regulated utilities 
offsetting  to some extent  these increases to tax expense  was a tax benefit recorded in of million associated with certain new york city general corporation tax issues 
in addition  certain costs associated with employee deferred compensation plans were deducted for federal income tax purposes in resulting in a beneficial permanent book to tax difference of million 
income tax expense for reflects a tax benefit of million as a result of the favorable resolution of certain outstanding tax issues related to the keyspan lilco merger 
additionally  we recorded an adjustment to deferred income taxes of million reflecting a decrease in the tax basis of the assets acquired at the time of the merger 
this adjustment was a result of a revised valuation study 
concurrent with the deferred tax adjustment  we reduced current income taxes payable by million  resulting in a million income tax benefit 
also  it should be noted that pre tax income in the consolidated statement of income reflects minority interest adjustments  whereas income taxes reflect the full amount of subsidiary taxes 
as discussed earlier  earnings available for common stock for the year ended december  also includes a net loss from discontinued operations of million 
as a result of the items just mentioned earnings available for common stock  which includes both the cumulative change in accounting principle  as well as discontinued operations  were million  or per share for the year ended december  compared to million  or per share earned in keyspan s consolidated earnings for were forecasted to be in the range of to per share  excluding special items 
earnings from continuing core operations defined for this purpose as all continuing operations other than exploration and production  less preferred stock dividends were forecasted to be in the range of to per share 
earnings from gas exploration and production operations  excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of houston exploration and the impact of the non cash impairment charge  were forecasted to be in the range of to per share 
actual earnings from continuing core operations  as defined  were per share  while earnings from exploration and production operations were per share 
financial outlook for keyspan s consolidated earnings for are forecasted to be in the range of to per share  excluding special items 
since we sold the majority of our non core assets in  the earnings forecast represents earnings from all continuing operations less preferred stock dividends 
further  the earnings forecast includes the anticipated dilutive impact from the conversion of the meds equity units 
see note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt for an explanation of the meds equity units 
consolidated earnings are seasonal in nature due to the significant contribution to earnings of our gas distribution operations 
as a result  we expect to earn most of our annual earnings in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
review of operating segments keyspan s segment results are reported on an operating income basis 
management believes that this generally accepted accounting principle gaap based measure provides a reasonable indication of keyspan s underlying performance associated with its operations 
the following is a discussion of financial results achieved by keyspan s operating segments presented on an operating income basis 
gas distribution keyspan energy delivery new york kedny provides gas distribution service to customers in the new york city boroughs of brooklyn  staten island and a portion of queens 
keyspan energy delivery long island kedli provides gas distribution service to customers in the long island counties of nassau and suffolk and the rockaway peninsula of queens county 
four natural gas distribution companies boston gas company  essex gas company  colonial gas company and energynorth natural gas  inc  each doing business under the name keyspan energy delivery new england kedne  provide gas distribution service to customers in massachusetts and new hampshire 
the table below highlights certain significant financial data and operating statistics for the gas distribution segment for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    cost of gas    revenue taxes    net gas revenues    operating expenses operations and maintenance    depreciation and amortization    operating taxes    total operating expenses    gain on the sale of property  operating income    firm gas sales and transportation mdth    transportation electric generation mdth    other sales mdth    warmer colder than normal new york long island warmer colder than normal new england a mdth is  therms and reflects the heating content of approximately one million cubic feet of gas 
a therm reflects the heating content of approximately cubic feet of gas 
one billion cubic feet bcf of gas equals approximately  mdth 
executive summary operating income increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period last year  primarily due to an increase in net revenues of million resulting  for the most part  from the boston gas company s rate proceeding that was concluded in november partially offsetting the increase in net revenues were higher operating expenses of million  primarily due to an increase of million in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a result of higher gas costs  as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses 
it should be noted that during we recorded million in gains from property sales on long island 
operating income increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period of  primarily due to an increase in net revenues of million resulting from significantly colder than normal weather experienced throughout the northeastern united states in  particularly during the primary winter heating months of january through march 
partially offsetting the increase in net revenues were higher operating expenses of million  attributable  in part  to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs of million 
further  the colder weather experienced during resulted in a higher level of repair and maintenance work on our gas distribution infrastructure which increased comparative operating expenses 
also depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the expansion of the gas distribution system 
as noted earlier  during we recorded million in gains from property sales on long island 
net revenues net gas revenues revenues less the cost of gas and associated revenue taxes from our gas distribution operations increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
net gas revenues benefited from the boston gas company rate increase granted in the fourth quarter of  as well as from customer additions and oil to gas conversions 
as measured in heating degree days  weather in in our new york and new england service territories was approximately and colder than normal  respectively  compared to approximately and colder than normal in  respectively 
weather in was approximately warmer than in our new york service territory and approximately warmer than last year in our new england service territory 
net revenues from firm gas customers residential  commercial and industrial customers in our new york service territory during the twelve months ended december  were essentially equivalent to the same period of we realized a million benefit to net gas revenues as a result of an additional billing day in the leap year and million associated with regulatory incentives 
weather  which was warmer than  resulted in an adverse impact to comparative net gas revenues of million 
kedny and kedli each operate under a utility tariff that contains a weather normalization adjustment that significantly offsets variations in firm net revenues due to fluctuations in normal weather 
since weather was colder than normal we refunded to firm customers million through the weather normalization adjustment 
the benefits of customer additions and oil to gas conversions were effectively offset by conservation and more efficient heating equipment  customer attrition and the adverse impact to customer usage due to higher natural gas prices 
also included in net gas revenues is the recovery of property taxes that were million lower in compared to these revenues  however  do not impact net income since the taxes they are designed to recover are expensed as amortization charges on the consolidated statement of income 
firm gas distribution rates for kedny and kedli during  other than for the recovery of gas costs  have remained substantially unchanged from rates charged in net revenues from firm gas customers in our new england service territory increased by million in compared to customer additions and oil to gas conversions  net of attrition and conservation  added million to net gas revenues 
further  we realized a million benefit in net gas revenues as a result of an additional billing day for leap year 
as mentioned  the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy madte approved a million base rate increase for the boston gas company  which became effective november  for the twelve months ended december   the rate increase resulted in a benefit to net gas revenues of million 
see the caption under regulation and rate matters for further information regarding the rate filing 
the gas distribution operations of our new england based subsidiaries do not have a weather normalization adjustment 
weather  which was warmer in than  resulted in an adverse impact to comparative net gas revenues of million 
to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in normal weather patterns on kedne s results of operations and cash flows  weather derivatives were in place for the and the winter heating seasons 
the impact of these derivative instruments resulted in a favorable impact to comparative net revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging and derivative financial instruments for further information 
in our large volume heating and other interruptible non firm markets  which include large apartment houses  government buildings and schools  gas service is provided under rates that are designed to compete with prices of alternative fuel  including no 
and no 
grade heating oil 
these dual fuel customers can consume either natural gas or fuel oil for heating purposes 
net revenues in these markets increased million in compared to the majority of interruptible profits earned by kedne and kedli are returned to firm customers as an offset to gas costs 
net gas revenues from our gas distribution operations increased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in both our new york and new england based gas distribution operations benefited from the significantly colder than normal weather experienced throughout the northeastern united states  particularly during the primary winter heating months  january through march  when our gas distribution operations realize over of their yearly operating income 
as measured in heating degree days  weather during the first quarter of was approximately colder than normal in our new york and new england service territories 
this contrasts with the extremely warm weather experienced during the first quarter of when weather was approximately warmer than normal 
on a twelve month basis  weather was approximately colder than normal in compared to warmer than normal in net gas revenues from firm gas customers in our new york service territories increased by million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of customer additions and oil to gas conversions  net of attrition and conservation  added approximately million to net revenues during the effect of higher customer consumption in due primarily to colder than normal weather  coupled with lower customer consumption in due to the extremely warmer than normal weather resulted in a comparative increase to firm net revenues of approximately million in compared to however  kedny and kedli each operate under a utility tariff that contains a weather normalization adjustment that significantly offsets variations in firm net revenues due to fluctuations from normal weather 
these tariff provisions resulted in a million refund to firm gas customers during also included in net revenues are regulatory incentives that reduced comparative net revenues by million and recovery of certain taxes that added million to net revenues during the recovery of taxes through revenues  however  does not impact net income since we expense a similar amount as amortization charges and income taxes  as appropriate  on the consolidated statement of income 
net gas revenues from firm gas customers in our new england service territories increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period of customer additions and oil to gas conversions  net of attrition and conservation  added approximately million to net revenues 
as with our new york service territories  higher customer consumption in due to the colder than normal weather  coupled with lower customer consumption in due to the warmer than normal weather  resulted in an increase in comparative net revenues for our new england based gas distribution utilities of approximately million in compared to as noted above  the gas distribution operations of our new england based subsidiaries do not have a weather normalization adjustment 
to mitigate the effect of fluctuations from normal weather patterns on kedne s results of operations and cash flows  weather derivatives were put in place for the and winter heating seasons 
since weather during the first quarter of was colder than normal in the new england service territories  we recorded an million reduction to revenues to reflect the loss on these derivative transactions 
similarly  in we recorded a million reduction to revenues 
as a result of these transactions  comparative net revenues were adversely impacted by million 
weather derivatives had only a marginal impact on net revenues during the fourth quarter of  since weather was approximately normal

also included in net revenues for are million of base rate adjustments resulting from boston gas company s recently concluded rate case 
further  included in net revenues for  was a benefit of million as a result of a favorable ruling from the massachusetts supreme judicial court relating to the appeal by boston gas company of its performance based rate plan pbr 
the net effect of these base rate adjustments was a favorable impact to comparative net revenues in of million 
see regulation and rate matters for a further discussion of these matters 
firm gas distribution rates for kedny and kedli in  other than for the recovery of gas costs  have remained substantially unchanged from rates charged in as noted  firm gas distribution rates for kedne reflect an increase of million resulting from the boston gas company s rate order  which became effective november  in our large volume heating and other interruptible non firm markets  net revenues increased by million during the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of as mentioned  the majority of interruptible profits earned by kedne and kedli are returned to firm customers as an offset to gas costs 
we are committed to our expansion strategy initiated during the past few years 
we believe that significant growth opportunities exist on long island and in our new england service territories 
we estimate that on long island approximately of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market currently use natural gas for space heating 
further  we estimate that in our new england service territories approximately of the residential and multi family markets  as well as the commercial market  currently use natural gas for space heating purposes 
we will continue to seek growth in all our market segments  through the economic expansion of our gas distribution system  as well as through the conversion of residential homes from oil to gas for space heating purposes and the pursuit of opportunities to grow the multi family  industrial and commercial markets 
firm sales  transportation and other quantities firm gas sales and transportation quantities for the year ended december   were approximately lower compared to such quantities for the same period in reflecting the warmer weather 
weather normalized sales quantities increased in our new york service territories during in our new england service territories  weather normalized sales quantities during were essentially the same as weather normalized sales quantities experienced in net revenues are not affected by customers opting to purchase their gas supply from other sources  since delivery rates charged to transportation customers generally are the same as delivery rates charged to full sales service customers 
transportation quantities related to electric generation reflect the transportation of gas to our electric generating facilities located on long island 
net revenues from these services are not material 
other sales quantities include on system interruptible quantities  off system sales quantities sales made to customers outside of our service territories and related transportation 
we have an agreement with coral resources  lp coral  a subsidiary of shell oil company  under which coral assists in the origination  structuring  valuation and execution of energy related transactions on behalf of kedny and kedli 
upon expiration of this agreement  march   these services will be performed with keyspan employees 
we also have a portfolio management contract with merrill lynch trading  under which merrill lynch trading provides all of the city gate supply requirements at market prices and manages certain upstream capacity  underground storage and term supply contracts for kedne 
this agreement expires on march  total actual firm gas sales and transportation quantities increased by during the year ended december   compared to the same period in in the new york service territories actual firm sales increased  while firm sales in the new england service territories increased 
weather normalized sales quantities increased in the new york service territories and in the new england service territories 
the increases in both actual and weather normalized gas sale quantities reflect higher customer consumption as a result of the significantly colder than normal weather in  as well as from customer additions and oil to gas conversions for space heating purposes 
further  as mentioned previously  gas sales quantities in were adversely impacted by the exceptionally warm weather 
purchased gas for resale the increase in gas costs for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of of million  or  reflects an increase of in the price per dekatherm of gas purchased  and a decrease in the quantity of gas purchased 
the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred for sale to firm customers and gas costs billed to firm customers are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
the increase in gas costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in of million  or  reflects an increase of in the price per dekatherm of gas purchased  and a increase in the quantity of gas purchased 
operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the same period last year  reflecting higher operations and maintenance and depreciation expense 
operations and maintenance expense increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase of million in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a result of increasing gas costs  as well as higher employee welfare costs  primarily postretirement expenses of approximately million 
these increases to operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by a benefit of approximately million  net of amounts subject to regulatory deferral treatment  associated with the implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of medicare act and implementation of financial accounting standards board staff position fsp see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies item o recent accounting pronouncements for further information regarding the act and fsp in addition  in september  boston gas company reached an agreement with an insurance carrier for recovery of previously incurred environmental expenditures 
under a previously issued madte order  insurance and third party recoveries  after deducting legal fees  are shared between boston gas and its firm gas customers 
as a result of the insurance agreement  in september boston gas recorded a million benefit to operations and maintenance expense 
higher depreciation and amortization expense reflects the continued expansion of the gas distribution system  while the lower operating taxes resulted primarily from a property tax refund in our new york service territory 
operating expenses in increased million  or  compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs  which increased net of amounts deferred and subject to regulatory true ups by million during the cost of these benefits grew primarily as a result of lower actual returns on plan assets  as well as increased health care costs 
further  the colder weather experienced during resulted in a higher level of repair and maintenance work on our gas distribution infrastructure which increased comparative operating expenses by approximately million 
higher depreciation and amortization expense reflects the continued expansion of the gas distribution system 
further  included in depreciation and amortization expense is the amortization of certain property taxes previously deferred and currently being recovered in revenues 
comparative operating taxes reflect a favorable million adjustment recorded during relating to the reversal of excess tax reserves established for the keyspan lilco combination in may sale of property during we recorded million in gains from property sales  primarily acres of real property located on long island 
other matters in order to serve the anticipated market requirements in our new york service territories  keyspan and duke energy corporation formed islander east pipeline company  llc islander east in islander east is owned by keyspan and by duke energy  and was created to pursue the authorization and construction of an interstate pipeline from connecticut  across long island sound  to a terminus near shoreham  long island 
applications for all necessary regulatory authorizations were filed in and islander east has received a final certificate from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and all necessary permits from the state of new york 
the state of connecticut denied islander east s applications for coastal zone management and section of the clean water act authorizations 
islander east appealed the state of connecticut s determination on the coastal zone management issue to the united states department of commerce 
on may   the department of commerce overrode connecticut s denial and granted the coastal zone management authorization 
islander east s petition for a declaratory order challenging the denial of the section authorization is pending with connecticut s state superior court 
once in service  the pipeline is expected to transport up to  dth daily to the long island and new york city energy markets  enough natural gas to heat  homes 
the pipeline will also allow keyspan to diversify the geographic sources of its gas supply 
various options for the financing of this pipeline construction are being evaluated 
at december   our investment in the islander east pipeline was million 
in addition  in august  keyspan acquired a interest in the millennium pipeline development project which is anticipated to transport up to  dth of natural gas a day to the algonquin pipeline 
the project has been approved by the ferc and  pending an amendment to the project s ferc certificate  construction could begin as early as the third quarter of  with service beginning in late once constructed  keyspan anticipates contracting for  dth per day of transportation capacity from the millennium pipeline system 
as of december   our investment in this project was million 
electric services the electric services segment primarily consists of subsidiaries that own and operate oil and gas fired electric generating plants in the borough of queens including the ravenswood projects and the counties of nassau and suffolk on long island 
in addition  through long term contracts of varying lengths  we manage the electric transmission and distribution t d system  the fuel and electric purchases  and the off system electric sales for lipa 
the electric services segment also provides retail marketing of electricity to commercial customers  the earnings from which were previously reported in the energy services segment 
financial results for and have been reclassified to reflect these activities in the electric services segment 
selected financial data for the electric services segment is set forth in the table below for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    purchased fuel    net revenues    operating expenses operations and maintenance    depreciation    operating taxes    total operating expenses    gain on the sale of property   operating income    electric sales mwh    capacity mw    summer cooling degree days   reflects the operations of the ravenswood projects only 
executive summary operating income increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period last year  due primarily to an increase in net revenues from the ravenswood projects of million  partially offset by higher depreciation expense and operating taxes 
in addition  also in  keyspan recognized a gain of million on the sale of a parcel of land in far rockaway  queens  to lipa 
operating income decreased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period of  primarily due to higher postretirement expenses of million 
in addition  in we settled certain outstanding issues with lipa and the consolidated edison company of new york that resulted in a million decrease to operating expenses in net revenues total electric net revenues realized during were million  or higher than such revenues realized during this increase is primarily attributable to the operation of the ravenswood expansion 
net revenues from the ravenswood projects increased million  or in compared to reflecting increased capacity revenues of million  as well as higher energy margins of million 
the increase in capacity revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to the corresponding period last year primarily reflects the operation of the ravenswood expansion 
see the discussion below under other matters for a description of the ravenswood expansion 
the increase in energy margins for the twelve months ended december   reflects a increase in the level of megawatt hours mwh sold into the new york independent system operator nyiso energy market  as well as an increase of in realized spark spreads the selling price of electricity less the cost of fuel  plus hedging gains or losses 
the increase in energy sales quantities reflects the operations of the ravenswood expansion 
as measured in cooling degree days  weather during the peak summer months of was approximately warmer than last year  but cooler than normal 
further  energy sales quantities in were adversely impacted by the scheduled major overhaul of our largest electric generating unit 
we employ derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability for a portion of forecasted purchases of natural gas and fuel oil consumed at the ravenswood projects 
further  we have engaged in the use of derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of forecasted electric energy sales from the ravenswood projects 
these derivative instruments resulted in hedging gains  which are reflected in net electric margins  of million in compared to hedging gains of million for the benefits derived from keyspan s hedging strategy contributed to an increase in realized spark spreads despite the cooler weather during the peak summer months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging and derivative financial instruments and fair values as well as item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information 
the rules and regulations for capacity  energy sales and the sale of certain ancillary services to the nyiso energy markets continue to evolve and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has adopted several price mitigation measures that have adversely impacted earnings from the ravenswood facility 
certain of these mitigation measures are still subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
see the caption market and credit risk management activities for a further discussion of these matters 
net revenues from the service agreements with lipa  including the power purchase agreements associated with two electric peaking facilities  increased million for the twelve months ended december   compared to this increase reflects  in part  recovery from lipa of approximately million in higher property taxes and depreciation charges 
these recoveries had no impact on operating income since actual property taxes and depreciation charges increased by a like amount 
further  comparative revenues reflect adjustments to the cost recovery mechanism in the lipa service agreements to match actual costs incurred with recovery of such costs 
these adjustments reduced revenues in by approximately million compared to these adjustments to revenues had no impact on operating income since actual operating costs decreased by a like amount 
excluding these two items  net revenues from the service agreements with lipa decreased approximately million in  compared to  reflecting a lower level of off system sales and emission credits  both of which are shared with lipa 
in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned in for a description of the lipa agreements  see the discussion under the caption lipa agreements 
in addition to the above  net revenues from our electric marketing activities were slightly lower in compared to total electric net revenues decreased million  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in net revenues from the ravenswood facility were million lower in compared to comparative net revenues reflect higher capacity revenues of million  offset by a decrease in energy margins of million 
the increase in capacity revenues reflects increases in the level of capacity sold and in the selling price of capacity 
such increases were the result of two measures 
first  in  the nyiso employed a revised methodology to assess the available supply of and demand for installed capacity 
this revised methodology resulted in insufficient capacity being procured by the market  which caused a reliability concern 
further  the revised methodology resulted in lower capacity volume sold into the nyiso and depressed capacity pricing during the year ended december  the nyiso  however  recognized a calculation flaw in its revised methodology  and prior to the winter season capacity auction  corrected the calculation methodology to ensure that sufficient capacity was procured 
the corrected calculation methodology ensured compliance with new york state reliability rules and resulted in higher capacity revenue realized at the ravenswood facility in compared to the prior year 
in addition  on may   ferc approved the nyiso s revised capacity market procurement design with an effective date of may  this revised capacity market procurement design was based on a demand curve rather than relying on deficiency auctions to procure necessary capacity 
the deficiency auction with its associated fixed minimum capacity requirements was replaced with a spot market auction that pays gradually declining prices as additional capacity is offered and gradually increasing prices as capacity offers decrease 
this new market design recognizes the value of capacity in excess of the minimum requirement and reduces price spikes during periods of shortage 
essentially  the demand curve design eliminates the high and low cycles inherent in the deficiency auction market design 
this new market design also established seasonal electric generator specific price caps 
price caps establish the maximum price per mw that capacity can be sold into the nyiso by divested electric generators like ravenswood 
prior to this design change  one price cap was established for the entire year and was effective for all electric generators 
for the ravenswood facility  its summer price cap was higher than the yearly price cap effective during the summer 
as a result of these market design changes  the ravenswood facility realized higher capacity revenues during compared to it should be noted  however  that ravenswood s structured winter price cap was lower than the yearly price cap effective during the winter  which was prior to the implementation of the new demand curve methodology 
the decrease in comparative energy margins in primarily reflects significantly cooler weather during the summer of compared to the summer of measured in cooling degree days  weather for was cooler than the cooler weather resulted in lower realized spark spreads the selling price of electricity less cost of fuel  plus hedging gains or losses  as well as a reduction in megawatt hours sold into the nyiso 
further  more competitive behavior by market participants that bid into the nyiso  as well as certain price mitigation measures imposed by the ferc as noted earlier have resulted in lower comparative realized spark spreads 
energy sales quantities during a portion of were also adversely impacted by the scheduled major overhaul of our largest generating unit  as previously indicated 
as noted earlier  we employ derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability for a portion of forecasted purchases of natural gas and fuel oil consumed at the ravenswood projects  as well as to hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of forecasted peak electric energy sales from these facilities 
these derivative instruments resulted in hedging gains  which were reflected in net electric margins  of million for the year ended december  compared to hedging gains of million for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for further information 
net revenues from the service agreements with lipa decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in included in revenues for were billings to lipa for certain third party costs that were lower than such billings in these revenues had minimal or no impact on earnings since we record a similar amount of costs in operating expense and we share any cost under runs with lipa 
excluding these third party billings  revenues in associated with these service agreements increased approximately million compared to the increase reflects a higher level of service fees charged to lipa for the recovery of past operating costs 
in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned in net revenues from the peaking facilities were million higher in compared to  reflecting a full year of operation 
the facilities were placed in service on june  and july  these facilities added a combined megawatts of generating capacity to keyspan s electric generation portfolio 
the capacity of and energy produced by these facilities are dedicated to lipa under year contracts 
the remaining decrease in net revenues reflects lower net revenues associated with keyspan s electric marketing subsidiary 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period of  due to higher operating taxes and depreciation charges  partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance expense decreased million reflecting  in part  million in lower costs associated with the lipa service agreements as noted earlier 
operations and maintenance expense also reflects the impact of fin which required keyspan to consolidate the ravenswood master lease and classify the lease obligation as long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  an asset was recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for an amount substantially equal to the fair market value of the leased assets at the inception of the lease  less depreciation since that date 
as a result of implementing fin  beginning january   lease payments associated with the ravenswood master lease have been reflected as interest expense on the consolidated statement of income and the leased assets are being depreciated 
the reclassification of lease payments associated with the ravenswood master lease to interest expense resulted in a comparative decrease to operations and maintenance expense of million 
however  keyspan incurred lease costs of million associated with the sale leaseback transaction involving the ravenswood expansion  that went into effect may in addition  keyspan incurred increased repair and maintenance costs  including removal costs  associated with the ravenswood projects  as well as higher postretirement costs  which  for the most part  offset the beneficial impact of fin the increase in depreciation expense of million primarily relates to the depreciation of the leased assets under the ravenswood master lease which increased depreciation by million 
the remaining increase in depreciation expense is associated with keyspan s long island based electric generating units and is fully recoverable from lipa 
the higher operating taxes primarily reflect an increase in property taxes which are fully recoverable from lipa  as noted earlier 
operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december   compared to included in comparative operating expenses is a decrease in third party capital costs that are fully recoverable from lipa  as noted earlier 
excluding the decrease in these costs  operating expenses increased approximately million 
this increase resulted  in part  from higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
lipa reimburses keyspan for costs directly incurred by keyspan in providing service to lipa  subject to certain sharing provisions 
variations between pension and other postretirement costs and the estimates used to bill lipa are deferred and refunded to or collected from lipa in subsequent periods 
as a result of an adjustment recorded in relating to this true up  comparative pension and other postretirement costs were approximately million higher in compared to in addition  in we settled certain outstanding issues with lipa and the consolidated edison company of new york consolidated edison that resulted in a million decrease to operating expenses in operating taxes reflect an increase in property tax rates associated with the ravenswood facility 
the increase in depreciation expense is associated with the two peaking facilities 
other matters the ravenswood expansion  a mw combined cycle generating facility  was synchronized to the electric grid in december and commenced operational testing in january in march  the facility completed full load dependable maximum net capacity testing and in may the facility began full commercial operations 
the entire capacity and energy produced from this plant is being sold into the nyiso markets 
to finance this facility  keyspan entered into a leveraged lease financing arrangement 
in may  the facility was acquired by a lessor from our subsidiary  keyspan ravenswood  llc  and simultaneously leased back to it 
all the obligations of our subsidiary under the lease have been unconditionally guaranteed by keyspan 
this lease transaction generated cash proceeds of million  before transaction costs  which approximates the fair market value of the facility  as determined by a third party appraiser 
the lease has an initial term of years and the yearly operating lease expense will be approximately million per year 
lease payments will fluctuate from year to year  but are substantially paid over the first years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  financial guarantees and contingencies for additional information regarding this financing arrangement 
in  the new york state board on electric generation siting and the environment issued an opinion and order which granted a certificate of environmental capability and public need for a mw combined cycle electric generating facility in melville  long island  which is now final and non appealable 
also in  lipa issued a request for proposal rfp seeking bids from developers to either build and operate a long island generating facility  and or a new cable that will link long island to dedicated off long island power of between to mw of electricity by no later than the summer of keyspan and american national power inc anp filed a joint proposal in response to lipa s rfp 
under the proposal  keyspan and anp would have jointly owned and operated two mw electric generating facilities to be located on long island  one of which is the melville site and the other in the town of brookhaven which also has received all permits and approvals 
in may  lipa tentatively selected proposals submitted by two other bidders in response to the rfp 
keyspan remains committed to the melville project and the benefits to long island s energy future that this project would supply 
the project has received new york state article x approval by having met all operational and environmental permitting requirements 
further  the project is strategically located in close proximity to both the high voltage power transmission grid and the high pressure gas distribution network 
lipa is in the process of performing a long term strategic review initiative regarding its future direction 
some of the strategic options that lipa is considering include whether lipa should continue its operations as they presently exist  fully municipalize or privatize  sell some  but not all of their assets and become a regulator of rates and services 
until lipa makes a determination on its future direction  we are unable to determine what the outcome of this strategic review will have on the melville project 
at december   total capitalized costs associated with the siting  permitting and procurement of equipment for the melville facility were approximately million 
as part of our growth strategy  we continually evaluate the possible acquisition and development of additional generating facilities in the northeast 
however  we are unable to predict when or if any such facilities will be acquired and the effect any such acquired facilities will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
energy services the energy services segment includes subsidiaries that provide energy related services to customers primarily located within the northeastern united states  with concentrations in the new york city and boston metropolitan areas  through the following lines of business i home energy services  which provides residential and small commercial customers with service and maintenance of energy systems and appliances and ii business solutions  which now provides operation and maintenance  design  engineering and consulting services to commercial and industrial customers 
the table below highlights selected financial information for the energy services segment 
the december  and data has been restated to reflect certain businesses in the business solutions division specifically the mechanical contracting companies as discontinued operations due to the sale of these companies in january and february year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    less operating expenses    goodwill impairment  operating loss    the energy services segment incurred operating losses of million for the year ended december  compared to losses of million for the same period last year 
as noted earlier  in september  keyspan recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in continuing operations of million as a result of an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in this segment 
based upon the operating results experienced by the energy services segment and management s opinion that it was likely that a significant portion of the energy services segment would be sold within one year  keyspan conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of its investments in this segment 
that evaluation resulted in a total pre tax impairment charge of million million  or per share after tax million of this charge is attributable to continuing operations  while the remaining million million after tax  or per share  has been reflected in discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for additional details on this charge 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  operating income for the twelve months ended december  was essentially the same as lower operating results realized by home energy services were offset by lower operating expenses of the remaining business solutions companies 
home energy services experienced higher operating expenses as a result of the write off of accounts receivable and contract revenues on certain projects that were deemed to be uncollectible  as well as the write down of inventory balances 
operating results were million better in compared to due to the operations of the home energy services group of companies 
comparative operating results reflect losses incurred during  resulting from the non renewal of appliance service contracts due to the warm first quarter weather  as well as from an increase in the provision for bad debts 
energy investments the energy investments segment consists of our gas exploration and production investments  as well as certain other domestic and international energy related investments 
in june  keyspan exchanged million shares of common stock of the houston exploration company houston exploration an independent natural gas and oil exploration company located in houston  texas for of the stock of seneca upshur petroleum  inc seneca upshur  previously a wholly owned subsidiary of houston exploration 
this transaction reduced our interest in houston exploration from to approximately 
as part of this transaction  houston exploration retired million of its common shares and issued million new shares in a public offering 
based on houston exploration s announced offering price of per share  seneca upshur s shares were valued at the equivalent of million  or per share 
seneca upshur s assets consisted of west virginia gas producing properties valued at million  and million in cash 
keyspan follows an accounting policy of income statement recognition for parent company gains or losses from common stock transactions initiated by its subsidiaries 
as a result  this transaction resulted in a gain to keyspan of million 
effective june   houston exploration s earnings and our ownership interest in houston exploration were accounted for on the equity basis of accounting 
the deconsolidation of houston exploration required the recognition of certain deferred taxes on our remaining investment resulting in a net deferred tax expense of million 
therefore  the net gain on the share exchange less the deferred tax provision was million  or per share 
in november  keyspan sold its remaining interest in houston exploration million shares and received cash proceeds of approximately million 
keyspan recorded a pre tax gain of million which is reflected in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
the after tax gain was million or per share 
our gas exploration and production activities now include our wholly owned subsidiaries seneca upshur and keyspan exploration and production  llc keyspan exploration and production  which is engaged in a joint venture with houston exploration 
in the second quarter of  keyspan recorded a million non cash impairment charge to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies item f gas exploration and production property depletion for further information on this charge 
asset transactions regarding our investment in houston exploration were also recorded in in february  we reduced our ownership interest in houston exploration from to approximately following the repurchase  by houston exploration  of three million shares of common stock owned by keyspan 
we realized net proceeds of million in connection with this repurchase 
keyspan realized a gain of million on this transaction  which is reflected in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
income taxes were not provided  since this transaction was structured as a return of capital 
selected financial data and operating statistics for our gas exploration and production activities is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
operating income represents of our gas exploration and production subsidiaries results for all periods prior to may  and five months of equity earnings june  through october  for our interest in houston exploration 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    less depletion and amortization expense    full cost ceiling test write down  other operating expenses    plus equity earnings  operating income    executive summary operating income decreased million in compared to reflecting keyspan s lower ownership in houston exploration during the year  and its ultimate sale as discussed above 
operating income increased million in compared to due to significantly higher average realized gas prices and a moderate increase in production volumes offset  to some extent  by an increase in operating expenses associated with a higher depletion rate  as well as higher lease operating expenses and severance taxes 
operating income the decline in operating income of million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  reflects the reduction in keyspan s ownership interest in houston exploration 
as noted  in keyspan maintained a ownership interest in houston exploration 
in  keyspan maintained a ownership interest for the five month period january  through may   then held an approximate interest for the five month period june  through october  keyspan sold its remaining interest in houston exploration in november further  the reduction in operating income in also reflects the million non cash impairment charge recorded by keyspan s wholly owned gas exploration and production subsidiaries to reflect the reduced valuation of proved reserves  as noted above 
seneca upshur utilizes over the counter otc natural gas swaps to hedge the cash flow variability associated with forecasted sales of a portion of its natural gas production 
at december   seneca upshur has hedge positions in place for approximately of its estimated through gas production  net of gathering costs 
we use forward index prices to value these swap positions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values for further details on the derivative financial instruments 
natural gas prices continue to be volatile and the risk that we may be required to record an impairment charge on our full cost pool again in the future increases when natural gas prices are depressed or if we have significant downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
the increase in operating income of million or for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  reflected a significant increase in revenues 
the higher revenues were offset  to some extent  by an increase in operating expenses associated with a higher depletion rate  as well as higher lease operating expenses and severance taxes  as discussed below 
revenues for the year ended benefited from the combination of a increase in average realized gas prices average wellhead price received for production including hedging gains and losses and a increase in production volumes 
derivative financial hedging instruments were employed by houston exploration to provide more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
the average realized gas price for the year ended was of the average unhedged natural gas price  resulting in revenues that were approximately million lower than revenues that would have been achieved if derivative financial instruments had not been in place during houston exploration hedged slightly less than of its production  principally through the use of costless collars 
the depletion rate experienced in was per mcf  compared to per mcf experienced in the increase in the depletion rate reflected downward reserve revisions related to performance  the addition of more costs to houston exploration s depletion base with fewer additions of reserves  as well as an increase in estimated future development costs at year end 
the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december   compared to the same period of was primarily due to increased lease operating costs and severance taxes 
lease operating expenses increased million in compared to  as a result of the continued expansion of operations both onshore and offshore 
severance tax  which is a function of volume and revenues generated from onshore production  increased million in compared to as a result of the increase in average wellhead prices for natural gas 
overall operating expenses were increasing as new wells and facilities were added and production from existing wells was maintained 
for much of  subsidiaries in this segment also held an ownership interest in certain midstream natural gas assets in western canada through keyspan canada 
these assets included processing plants and associated gathering systems that can process approximately bcfe of natural gas daily and provide associated natural gas liquids fractionation 
at the beginning of  keyspan held a ownership interest in keyspan canada 
in april  keyspan and keyspan facilities income fund the fund  an open ended income fund trust which previously owned the other interest in keyspan canada  consummated a transaction whereby the fund sold million units of the fund at a price of cdn per unit for gross total proceeds of approximately cdn million 
the proceeds of the offering were used by the fund to acquire an additional interest in keyspan canada from keyspan 
we received net proceeds of approximately cdn million or approximately us million  after commissions and expenses 
the fund s ownership in keyspan canada increased from to  and keyspan s ownership of keyspan canada decreased from to 
keyspan recorded a gain of million million after tax  or per share on this transaction 
effective april  keyspan canada s earnings and our ownership interest in keyspan canada had been accounted for on the equity basis of accounting 
in july  the fund issued an additional million units  the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisition of the midstream assets of chevron canada midstream inc this transaction had the effect of further diluting keyspan s ownership of keyspan canada to 
in december  keyspan sold its remaining interest in keyspan canada to the fund and received net proceeds of approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain of million  which is reflected in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
the after tax gain was approximately million  or per share 
asset transactions regarding our investment in keyspan canada were also recorded in in  we sold a portion of our interest in keyspan canada through the fund 
the fund acquired a ownership interest in keyspan canada through an indirect subsidiary  and then issued million trust units to the public through an initial public offering 
each trust unit represented a beneficial interest in the fund and was registered on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol key 
un 
additionally  we sold our interest in taylor ngl lp that owns and operates two extraction plants also in canada to altagas services  inc net proceeds of million from the two sales  plus proceeds of million drawn under a new credit facility made available to keyspan canada  were used to pay down existing keyspan canada credit facilities of million 
a pre tax loss of million was recognized on the transactions and was included in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
these transactions produced a tax expense of million as a result of certain united states partnership tax rules and resulted in an after tax loss of million 
this segment is also engaged in pipeline development activities 
keyspan and duke energy corporation each own a interest in islander east pipeline company  llc islander east 
islander east was created to pursue the authorization and construction of an interstate pipeline from connecticut  across long island sound  to a terminus near shoreham  long island 
once in service  the pipeline is expected to transport up to  dth daily to the long island and new york city energy markets 
further  in august  keyspan acquired a interest in the millennium pipeline project which will transport up to  dth of natural gas a day from corning to ramapo  new york  where it will connect to an existing pipeline 
additionally  subsidiaries in this segment hold a equity interest in the iroquois gas transmission system lp  a pipeline that transports canadian gas supply to markets in the northeastern united states and the keyspan lng facility in providence  rhode island  a  barrel liquefied natural gas storage and receiving facility 
these subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method 
accordingly  equity income from these investments is reflected as a component of operating income in the consolidated statement of income 
in addition to the asset sales noted previously  keyspan anticipates selling its interest in ptl  a gas pipeline from southwest scotland to northern ireland 
on february   keyspan entered into a share sale and purchase agreement with bg energy holdings limited and premier transmission financing plc ptf  pursuant to which all of the outstanding shares of ptl are to be purchased by ptf 
it is expected that the sale of our interest in ptl will result in proceeds of approximately million and that the closing of this transaction will occur before the end of the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  keyspan recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million million after tax or per share  reflecting the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of ptl compared to its carrying value 
this investment is also accounted for under the equity method 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our then interest in phoenix natural gas limited for million and recorded a pre tax gain of million in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
selected financial data for our other energy related investments is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
operating income below represents of keyspan canada s results for three months ended march  and equity earnings from april  through november  year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    less operation and maintenance expense    other operating expenses    impairment charge  add equity earnings    gain on sale of property   operating income    the decrease in comparative operating income in compared to last year reflects the impairment charge associated with our investment in ptl  as well as our lower ownership interest in keyspan canada 
operating income from our other energy related investments in was substantially the same as the increase in operating income in compared to reflects  in part  higher operating income associated with our canadian investments  primarily keyspan canada  as well as higher earnings from our northern ireland investments 
keyspan canada experienced higher unit sales  as well as higher quantities of sales of natural gas liquids in  as a result of increasing oil prices 
the pricing of natural gas liquids is directly related to oil prices 
the northern ireland investments realized higher gas sales quantities  as well as favorable exchange rates during operating income for also reflects our investment in the keyspan lng storage facility located in rhode island  which we acquired in december allocated costs as previously mentioned  keyspan is subject to the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission sec under the public utility holding company act puhca as amended 
under puhca  the sec regulates various transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
in accordance with the sec s regulations under puhca and the new york state public service commission  we have service companies that provide i traditional corporate and administrative services  ii gas and electric transmission and distribution systems planning  marketing  and gas supply planning and procurement  and iii engineering and surveying services to subsidiaries 
operating income variations reflected in eliminations and other associated with these non operating subsidiaries reflect  in part  allocation adjustments recorded in as required by the sec  during we adjusted certain provisions in our allocation methodology that resulted in certain costs being allocated back to certain non operating subsidiaries 
further  in keyspan reached a settlement with its insurance carriers regarding cost recovery for expenses incurred at a non utility environmental site and recorded an million gain from the settlement as a reduction to operating expenses 
the variation in operating income for these non operating subsidiaries between and primarily reflects a million favorable adjustment recorded in for environmental reserves associated with non utility environmental sites based on a site investigation study concluded in the fourth quarter of liquidity cash flow from operations for the year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to primarily due to federal tax refunds received in during  keyspan performed an analysis of costs capitalized for self constructed property and inventory for income tax purposes 
keyspan filed a change of accounting method for income tax purposes resulting in a cumulative deduction for costs previously capitalized 
as a result of this tax method change  along with accelerated deductions resulting from bonus depreciation  keyspan received in october  a million refund from the internal revenue service for prior year taxes  as well as an additional million for tax payments made in on a comparative basis  tax refunds received in compared with federal tax payments made in of million  resulted in a comparative cash flow decrease in of approximately million 
further  cash flow from operations for was adversely impacted by the deconsolidation of houston exploration in june on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was enacted into law 
a significant provision of the act  as it relates to keyspan  is the dividend deduction for dividends received from foreign corporations 
the act allows keyspan to tax effectively bring funds invested outside the united states back into the united states 
at december  keyspan had million of temporary cash investments outside the united states 
keyspan intends to repatriate this cash in cash flow from operations for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to as noted above  in keyspan received approximately in federal tax refunds 
these refunds compared to tax payments made in  resulted in a cash flow benefit in  compared to  of approximately million 
comparative operating cash flow also reflects the collection of gas accounts receivable associated with higher winter gas heating sales 
as a result of load additions  colder than normal winter weather during the first quarter of  higher natural gas prices  and higher accounts receivable at the end of  cash receipts from gas heating customers were higher in than in further  the higher natural gas prices resulted in an increase in operating cash flow associated with the operations of houston exploration 
these benefits to cash flow were partially offset by significantly higher cash expenditures to refill natural gas storage levels as a result of the higher natural gas prices 
at december   we had cash and temporary cash investments of million 
during  we borrowed an additional million of commercial paper and  at december   million of commercial paper was outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
we had the ability to borrow up to an additional million at december   under the terms of our credit facility 
as discussed in more detail under the caption financing  in january keyspan used a portion of its temporary cash investments to redeem million of previously outstanding long term debt 
in june  keyspan completed the restructuring of its credit facilities 
we entered into a new million five year revolving credit facility to replace the million  day facility which expired in june 
we also amended our existing three year million facility due june to reduce commitments thereunder by million to a new level of million 
the two credit facilities total billion and are each syndicated among sixteen banks 
these facilities continue to support keyspan s commercial paper program for working capital needs 
the fees for these facilities are subject to a ratings based grid  with an annual fee of on the new five year facility and on the existing three year facility 
both credit agreements allow for keyspan to borrow using several different types of loans  specifically  eurodollar loans  abr loans  or competitively bid loans 
eurodollar loans in the five year facility are based on the eurodollar rate plus a margin of for loans up to of the total five year facility  and an additional for loans over of the total five year facility 
in the three year facility eurodollar loans are based on the eurodollar rate plus a margin of for loans up to of the total three year facility  and an additional for loans over of the total three year facility 
abr loans are based on the highest of the prime rate  the base cd rate plus  or the federal funds effective rate plus 
competitive bid loans are based on bid results requested by keyspan from the lenders 
we do not anticipate borrowing against these facilities  however  if the credit rating on our commercial paper program were to be downgraded  it may be necessary to do so 
the facilities contain certain affirmative and negative operating covenants  including restrictions on keyspan s ability to mortgage  pledge  encumber or otherwise subject its property to any lien  as well as certain financial covenants that require us to  among other things  maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of no more than until the expiration of the existing three year facility in  at which time it will be lowered to 
violation of this covenant could result in the termination of the facilities and the required repayment of amounts borrowed thereunder  as well as possible cross defaults under other debt agreements 
under the terms of the credit agreements  keyspan s debt to total capitalization ratio reflects equity treatment for the meds equity units issued in may at december   consolidated indebtedness  as calculated under the terms of the credit agreements was of consolidated capitalization 
houston exploration and keyspan canada also had revolving credit facilities with commercial banks 
during the time period that houston exploration s results were consolidated with keyspan s the five months ended may  houston exploration borrowed million under its credit facility and repaid million 
keyspan canada repaid million under its facility during the first three months of the time period in which its results were consolidated with keyspan s 
these borrowings and repayments are included in the consolidated cash flow statement 
a substantial portion of consolidated revenues are derived from the operations of businesses within the electric services segment  that are largely dependent upon two large customers lipa and the nyiso 
additionally  our kedne gas supply is concentrated with merrill lynch trading 
accordingly  our cash flows are dependent upon the timely payment or delivery of amounts or commodity owed to us by these counterparties 
we satisfy our seasonal working capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 
we believe that these sources of funds are sufficient to meet our seasonal working capital needs 
capital expenditures and financing construction expenditures the table below sets forth our construction expenditures by operating segment for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands of dollars gas distribution   electric services   energy investments   energy services and other   construction expenditures related to the gas distribution segment are primarily for the renewal  replacement and expansion of the distribution system 
construction expenditures for the electric services segment reflect cost to maintain our generating facilities and construct the ravenswood expansion 
construction expenditures related to the energy investments segment primarily reflect costs associated with gas exploration and production activities  including those of houston exploration through may   as well as costs related to keyspan canada s gas processing facilities through april  the decrease in capital expenditures in compared to primarily reflects the lower ownership interest in houston exploration  as well as the completion of the ravenswood expansion in may construction expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
the amount of future construction expenditures is reviewed on an ongoing basis and can be affected by timing  scope and changes in investment opportunities 
financing in august  keyspan redeemed approximately million of outstanding debt

the remaining amount of the call premiums have been deferred for future recovery 
further  keyspan wrote off million of previously deferred financing costs which have been reflected in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income 
the total after tax expense of the debt redemption was million or per share 
during the third quarter of  kedny retired million of its outstanding gas facilities revenue bonds 
the funds used to retire this debt were drawn from a special deposit defeasance trust previously established by kedny 
approximately million of gas facilities revenue bonds remain outstanding 
in august  keyspan redeemed  shares of preferred stock series a par value that were previously issued in a private placement 
keyspan redeemed these shares at a premium and incurred a cash expenditure of million 
in addition  on january   keyspan redeemed million series due of outstanding debt 
keyspan incurred million in call premiums and wrote off million of previously deferred financing costs 
further  keyspan accelerated the amortization of approximately million of previously unamortized benefits associated with an interest rate swap on these bonds 
the accelerated amortization was recorded as a reduction to interest expense 
further  million series b of mandatory redeemable preferred stock is scheduled to be redeemed in may during the second quarter of  keyspan entered into a leveraged lease financing arrangement associated with the ravenswood expansion 
in may  the facility was acquired by a lessor from our subsidiary  keyspan ravenswood  llc  and simultaneously leased back to that subsidiary 
all of the obligations of our subsidiary under the lease have been unconditionally guaranteed by keyspan 
this lease transaction generated cash proceeds of million  before transaction costs  which approximates fair market value of the facility  as determined by a third party appraiser 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for additional information regarding this financing arrangement 
in october  keyspan filed a new universal shelf registration statement to issue  from time to time  up to billion in securities 
we will continue to evaluate our capital structure and financing strategy for and beyond

the medium term notes  the master lease and the tax exempt bonds are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet  the sale leaseback transaction is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  keyspan has guaranteed i up to million of surety bonds associated with certain construction projects currently being performed by former subsidiaries within the energy services segment  ii certain supply contracts  margin accounts and purchase orders for certain subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of million  and iii million of subsidiary letters of credit 
these guarantees are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
keyspan s guarantees on certain performance bonds relating to current construction projects of the discontinued mechanical contracting companies will remain in place throughout the construction period 
it is contemplated that the majority of the current contracts will be completed by the end of keyspan has received an indemnity bond issued by a third party to offset potential exposure related to a significant portion of the continuing guarantee 
at this time  we have no reason to believe that our subsidiaries or former subsidiaries will default on their current obligations

discussion of critical accounting policies and assumptions in preparing our financial statements  the application of certain accounting policies requires difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual effects on our financial position and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results if the judgments and assumptions underlying the estimates prove to be inaccurate 
the critical accounting policies requiring such subjectivity are discussed below 
percentage of completion percentage of completion accounting is a method of accounting for long term construction type contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  the method used for engineering and mechanical contracting revenue recognition by the energy services segment 
percentage of completion is measured principally by comparing the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are known 
application of percentage of completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts recorded within the consolidated balance sheet which arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of the contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers based on various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of the contract 
due to uncertainties inherent within estimates employed to apply percentage of completion accounting  it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses 
changes in estimates resulting in additional future costs to complete projects can result in reduced margins or loss contracts 
unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded change orders and claims may be made in the near term 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of those revised estimates be reported in the consolidated financial statements prospectively 
valuation of goodwill keyspan records goodwill on purchase transactions  representing the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in testing for goodwill impairment under sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  significant reliance is placed upon a number of estimates regarding future performance that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management 
a change in the fair value of our investments could cause a significant change in the carrying value of goodwill 
as prescribed in sfas  keyspan is required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
this evaluation is required to be performed at least annually  unless facts and circumstances indicated that the evaluation should be performed at an interim period during the year 
prior to this evaluation  the recorded goodwill for the energy services segment  as a result of prior acquisitions  was approximately million 
the energy services segment has experienced significantly lower operating profits and cash flows than originally projected 
as previously reported  management reviewed the operating performance of this segment 
at a meeting held on november   keyspan s board of directors authorized management to begin the process of disposing of a significant portion of its ownership interests in certain companies within the energy services segment specifically those companies engaged in mechanical contracting activities 
in january and february of  keyspan sold its mechanical contracting companies 
during keyspan conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in its energy services segment 
as a result of this evaluation  keyspan recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share in this charge was recorded as follows i million as an operating expense on the consolidated statement of income reflecting the write down of goodwill on energy services segment s continuing operations  and ii million as discontinued operations reflecting the impairment on the mechanical contracting companies 
keyspan employed a combination of two methodologies in determining the estimated fair value for its investment in the energy services segment  a market valuation approach and an income valuation approach 
under the market valuation approach  keyspan utilized a range of near term potential realizable values for the mechanical contracting businesses 
under the income valuation approach  the fair value was obtained by discounting the sum of i the expected future cash flows and ii the terminal value 
keyspan was required to make certain significant assumptions  specifically the weighted average cost of capital  short and long term growth rates and expected future cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for further details 
in addition to the goodwill evaluation conducted for the energy services segment  keyspan conducted evaluations of the goodwill recorded in the gas distribution and energy investments segments 
based on keyspan s evaluation of the fair value of the gas distribution unit  keyspan concluded that the fair value of the gas distribution unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment was necessary 
as noted previously  keyspan has entered into an agreement to sell its interest in ptl before the end of the second quarter of this investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the energy investments segment 
in the fourth quarter of keyspan recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million million after tax or per share 
the impairment charge reflects the difference between anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of ptl compared to its carrying value and was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
accounting for the effects of rate regulation on gas distribution operations the financial statements of the gas distribution segment reflect the ratemaking policies and orders of the new york public service commission nypsc  the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  and the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy madte 
four of our six regulated gas utilities kedny  kedli  boston gas company and energynorth natural gas  inc are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement recognizes the actions of regulators  through the ratemaking process  to create future economic benefits and obligations affecting rate regulated companies 
in separate merger related orders issued by the madte  the base rates charged by colonial gas company and essex gas company have been frozen at their current levels for ten year periods ending and  respectively 
due to the length of these base rate freezes  the colonial and essex gas companies had previously discontinued the application of sfas sfas allows for the deferral of expenses and income on the consolidated balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income of an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the amounts are reflected in rates 
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover costs in the future  all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas in that event  a write down of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result 
if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas for any of our rate regulated subsidiaries  we would apply the provisions of sfas regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
we estimate that the write off of our net regulatory assets at december  could result in a charge to net income of approximately million or per share  which would be classified as an extraordinary item 
in management s opinion  our regulated subsidiaries that currently are subject to the provisions of sfas will continue to be subject to sfas for the foreseeable future 
as is further discussed under the caption regulation and rate matters  in october the madte rendered its decision on the boston gas company s base rate case and performance based rate plan proposal submitted to the madte in april the rate plans previously in effect for kedny and kedli have expired 
the continued application of sfas to record the activities of these subsidiaries is contingent upon the actions of regulators with regard to future rate plans 
we are currently evaluating various options that may be available to us including  but not limited to  proposing new rate plans for kedny and kedli 
the ultimate resolution of any future rate plans could have a significant impact on the application of sfas to these entities and  accordingly  on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
energynorth natural gas  inc s base rates continue as set by the nhpuc in management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment 
pension and other postretirement benefits as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  postretirement benefits  keyspan participates in both non contributory defined benefit pension plans  as well as other post retirement benefit opeb plans collectively postretirement plans 
keyspan s reported costs of providing pension and opeb benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and opeb costs collectively postretirement costs are impacted by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also impact current and future postretirement costs 
postretirement costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including  anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the postretirement costs and benefit obligations 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over ten years 
certain gas distribution subsidiaries are subject to sfas  and  as a result  changes in postretirement expenses are deferred for future recovery from or refund to gas sales customers 
however  kedny  although subject to sfas  does not have a recovery mechanism in place for changes in postretirement costs 
further  changes in postretirement expenses associated with subsidiaries that service the lipa agreements are also deferred for future recovery from or refund to lipa 
for  the assumed long term rate of return on our postretirement plans assets was pre tax  net of expenses 
this is an appropriate long term expected rate of return on assets based on keyspan s investment strategy  asset allocation and the historical performance of equity and fixed income investments over long periods of time 
the actual year compound annual rate of return for the keyspan plans is greater than 
keyspan s master trust investment allocation policy target is equity and fixed income 
at december   the actual investment allocation was in line with the target 
in an effort to maximize plan performance  actual asset allocation will fluctuate from year to year depending on the then current economic environment 
based on the results of an asset and liability study conducted in projecting asset returns and expected benefit payments over a year period  keyspan has developed a multiyear funding strategy for its postretirement plans 
keyspan believes that it is reasonable to assume assets can achieve or outperform the assumed long term rate of return with the target allocation as a result of historical performance of equity investments over long term periods 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have impacted expense by approximately million  before deferrals 
the year end december  assumed discount rate used to determine postretirement obligations was 
our discount rate assumption is based upon the current investment yield associated with rating agency indices that have high quality long term corporate bonds 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed year end discount rate would have had no impact on expense 
however  a basis point decrease in the assumed year end discount rate would result in the recording of an additional minimum pension liability 
a year end discount rate of would have required an additional million debit to other comprehensive income oci before taxes and deferrals 
a year end discount rate of would have required an additional million debit to oci before taxes and deferrals 
at january   the assumed discount rate used to determine postretirement obligations was 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate at the beginning of the year would have impacted expense by approximately million  before deferrals 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term outlook 
historically  we have funded our qualified pension plans in excess of the amount required to satisfy minimum erisa funding requirements 
at december   we had a funding credit balance in excess of the erisa minimum funding requirements and as a result keyspan was not required to make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in however  although we have presently exceeded erisa funding requirements  our pension plans  on an actuarial basis  are currently underfunded 
therefore  during keyspan contributed million to its funded and unfunded postretirement plans 
for  keyspan expects to contribute approximately million to its funded and unfunded post retirement plans 
future funding requirements are heavily dependent on actual return on plan assets and prevailing interest rates 
full cost accounting as noted previously  during keyspan disposed of its ownership interest in houston exploration 
keyspan continues to maintain gas exploration and production activities through its two wholly owned subsidiaries keyspan exploration and seneca upshur 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries use the full cost method to account for their natural gas and oil properties 
under full cost accounting  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool 
capitalized costs include costs of all unproved properties  internal costs directly related to natural gas and oil activities  and capitalized interest 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
a quarterly ceiling test is performed to evaluate whether the net book value of the full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a write down or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a write down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
the ceiling test is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date  held constant over the life of the reserves 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to hedge against the volatility of natural gas prices 
in accordance with current sec guidelines  these derivatives are included in the estimated future cash flows in the ceiling test calculation 
as a result of the disposition of houston exploration  during most of keyspan calculated the ceiling test on keyspan exploration and production s and seneca uphsur s assets independently of houston exploration s assets 
based on a report furnished by an independent reservoir engineer during the second quarter of  it was determined that the remaining proved undeveloped oil reserves held in the joint venture required a substantial investment in order to develop 
therefore  keyspan and houston exploration elected not to develop these oil reserves 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge to write down our wholly owned gas exploration and production subsidiaries assets 
this charge was recorded in depreciation  depletion and amortization on the consolidated statement of income 
in calculating the ceiling test at december   our subsidiaries estimated that a full cost ceiling cushion existed  whereby the carrying value of the full cost pool was less that the ceiling limitation 
no write down is required when a cushion exists 
natural gas prices continue to be volatile and the risk that a write down to the full cost pool will be required increases when natural gas prices are depressed or if there are significant downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities represent estimates only 
under full cost accounting  reserve estimates are used to determine the full cost ceiling limitation  as well as the depletion rate 
keyspan s subsidiaries estimate proved reserves and future net revenues using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date they make the reserve estimates 
natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years  affect estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues 
any estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and their values are inherently uncertain  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  estimates of reserves may be revised based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing natural gas and oil prices  operating costs and other factors  which revision may be material 
reserve estimates are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the underlying assumptions 
actual future production may be materially different from estimated reserve quantities and the differences could materially affect future amortization of natural gas and oil properties 
accounting for sales of stock by a subsidiary keyspan applies the accounting principle of income recognition for gains or losses associated with the sale of stock by its subsidiaries 
as provided for in staff accounting bulletin topic h sab  the sec allows for income recognition of gains or losses on subsidiary stock transactions in instances where the transaction is not part of a broader corporate reorganization contemplated by the parent 
provided that no other capital transactions are contemplated with regard to the shares issued  income statement treatment in consolidation for issuance of stock by a subsidiary is appropriate 
sab requires that this accounting treatment  if elected by the parent  must be consistently applied to all subsidiary stock transactions that meet the conditions for income statement recognition 
as noted earlier  keyspan has appropriately applied this accounting treatment to its subsidiary stock transactions 
accounting for the sale leaseback transaction and ravenswood master lease in may the ravenswood expansion  a new mw combined cycle generating facility at the ravenswood facility site began full commercial operations 
the entire capacity and energy produced from this plant is being sold into the nyiso markets 
keyspan structured a leverage lease financing arrangement for this facility 
at the closing of the leasing transaction  the new facility was acquired by the lessor from a keyspan subsidiary and simultaneously leased back to that subsidiary 
keyspan has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of its subsidiary under the lease 
the lease has an initial term of years 
the financing arrangement qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standard sfas accounting for leases sale leaseback transactions involving real estate  sales type leases of real estate  definition of the lease term  an initial direct costs of direct financing  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and a rescission of fasb statement no 
and technical bulletin no 
the terms and conditions of the financing arrangement are also in accordance with the accounting requirements of sfas accounting for leases  sfas accounting for sales of real estate  and financial interpretation no 
fin r consolidation of variable interest entities 
as stated in sfas  sale leaseback accounting shall be used by the seller lessee only if the transaction includes all of the following i a normal leaseback  ii payment terms and provisions that adequately demonstrate the buyer lessor s initial and continuing investment in the property  and iii payment terms and provisions that transfer all of the other risks and rewards of ownership as demonstrated by the absence of any other continuing involvement by the seller lessee 
a normal leaseback is a lessee lessor relationship that involves the active use of the property by the seller lessee in consideration for the payment of rent 
active use of the property refers to the use of the property during the lease term in the seller lessee s trade or business 
electric generation is a significant part of keyspan s normal business and since we operate the new mw facility  this criteria has been met 
further  since the buyer lessor has paid keyspan the full fair market value of the facility  as determined by an independent third party appraiser  the second criteria has also been met 
with regard to criteria iii  keyspan is under no obligation to repurchase the generating facility  nor does it have an option to repurchase the facility 
further  the leasing arrangement does not contain a provision under which the buyer lessor can compel keyspan to repurchase the facility 
further  the buyer lessor assumes a significant risk regarding return of and on the initial capital investment 
sfas contains the following four basic criteria that  if met  would require a lease to be classified as a capital lease i the lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease  ii the lease contains a bargain purchase option  iii the lease term is equal to or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property  and iv the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds of the fair market value of the leased property 
the financing arrangement for the ravenswood expansion does not meet any of the above criteria 
further  fin r does not apply to this financing arrangement since the arrangement meets the criteria for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas more specifically the leasing arrangement does not absorb variability in the fair value in the underlying assets of the lease since the leasing arrangement does not guaranty to the buyer lessor the residual value of the leased assets and the arrangement does not contain an option for the seller lessee to acquire the leased assets after the term of the lease 
dividends in the third quarter of keyspan increased its dividend to an annual rate of per common share beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in february our dividend policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors

electric services revenue mechanisms lipa agreements keyspan  through certain of its subsidiaries  provides services to lipa under the following agreements management services agreement msa keyspan manages the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of the transmission and distribution t d system 
lipa exercises control over the performance of the t d system through specific standards for performance and incentives 
in exchange for providing the services  we earn a million annual management fee and are operating under a contract  which provides certain incentives and imposes certain penalties based upon performance 
in  we reached an agreement with lipa to extend the msa for months through  as discussed under the heading generation purchase right agreement below 
annual service incentives or penalties exist under the msa if certain targets are achieved or not achieved 
in addition  we can earn certain incentives for budget underruns associated with the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of lipa s t d system 
these incentives provide for us to i retain on the first million in annual budget underruns  and ii retain of additional annual underruns up to of the total cost budget  thereafter all savings accrue to lipa 
with respect to cost overruns  we will absorb the first million of overruns  with a sharing of overruns above million 
there are certain limitations on the amount of cost sharing of overruns 
to date  we have performed our obligations under the msa within the agreed upon budget guidelines and we are committed to providing on going services to lipa within the established cost structure 
however  no assurances can be given as to future operating results under this agreement 
power supply agreement psa keyspan sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by the ferc 
as noted previously  rates under the psa have been reestablished for the contract year commencing january  rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly per megawatt hour basis and is dependent on the number of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy conversion services from us and is able to purchase energy or energy conversion services on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system

the psa runs for a term of fifteen years through may  with lipa having the option to renew the psa for an additional fifteen year term 
energy management agreement ema the ema provides for keyspan to procure and manage fuel supplies on behalf of lipa to fuel the generating facilities under contract to it and perform off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs 
in exchange for these services we earn an annual fee of million 
in addition  we arrange for off system sales on behalf of lipa of excess output from the generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system energy sales 
in addition  the ema provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for performance related to fuel purchases and off system power purchases 
the ema is expected to be in effect through for the procurement of fuel supplies and through for off system management services 
under these agreements  we are required to obtain a letter of credit in the aggregate amount of million supporting our obligations to provide the various services if our long term debt is not rated in the a range by a nationally recognized rating agency 
generation purchase right agreement gpra under the gpra  lipa originally had the right for a one year period beginning on may   to acquire all of our long island based generating assets formerly owned by lilco at fair market value at the time of the exercise of such right 
by agreement dated march   lipa and keyspan amended the gpra to provide for a new six month option period ending on may  the other terms of the option reflected in the gpra remained unchanged 
in return for providing lipa an extension of the gpra  keyspan was provided with a corresponding extension of months for the msa to the end of lipa is in the process of performing a long term strategic review initiative regarding its future direction 
it has engaged a team of advisors and consultants and is conducting public hearings to develop recommendations to be submitted to the lipa trustees 
some of the strategic options that lipa is considering include whether lipa should continue its operations as they presently exist  fully municipalize or privatize  sell some  but not all of their assets and become a regulator of rates and services 
in the near term  lipa must make a determination by may  as to whether it will exercise its option to purchase our long island generating plants pursuant to the terms of the gpra 
until lipa makes a determination on its future direction  we are unable to determine what the outcome of this strategic review will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
any action that may be taken will have to take into consideration the term of our existing contracts 
keyspan glenwood and port jefferson energy centers keyspan glenwood energy center llc and keyspan port jefferson energy center llc have entered into year power purchase agreements the ppas with lipa 
under the terms of the ppas  these subsidiaries sell capacity  energy conversion services and ancillary services to lipa 
both plants are designed to produce megawatts 
under the ppas  lipa pays a monthly capacity fee  which guarantees full recovery of each plant s construction costs  as well as a rate of return on investment 
the ppas also obligate lipa to pay for each plant s costs of operation and maintenance 
these costs are billed on a monthly estimated basis and are subject to true up for actual costs incurred 
ravenswood projects we currently sell capacity  energy and ancillary services associated with the ravenswood projects through a bidding process into the nyiso energy and capacity markets 
energy is sold on both a day ahead and a real time basis 
we also have the ability to enter into bilateral transactions to sell all or a portion of the energy produced by the ravenswood projects to load serving entities  ie entities that sell to end users or to brokers and marketers 
environmental matters keyspan is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulatory programs related to the environment 
through various rate orders issued by the nypsc  dte and nhpuc  costs related to mgp environmental cleanup activities are recovered in rates charged to gas distribution customers and  as a result  adjustments to these reserve balances do not impact earnings 
however  environmental cleanup activities related to the three non utility sites are not subject to rate recovery 
in boston gas company reached an agreement with an insurance carrier for recovery of previously incurred environmental expenditures 
under a previously issued madte order  insurance and third party recoveries  after deducting legal fees  are shared between boston gas and its firm gas customers 
as a result of the insurance agreement  in september boston gas recorded a million benefit to operations and maintenance expense 
also in  keyspan reached a settlement with its insurance carriers regarding cost recovery for expenses incurred at a non utility environmental site and recorded an million benefit from the settlement as a reduction to operations and maintenance expense 
we estimate that the remaining cost of our mgp related environmental cleanup activities  including costs associated with the ravenswood facility  will be approximately million and we have recorded a related liability for such amount 
we have also recorded an additional million liability  representing the estimated environmental cleanup costs related to a former coal tar processing facility 
as of december   we have expended a total of million on environmental investigation and remediation activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  guarantees and contingencies for a further explanation of these matters 
market and credit risk management activities market risk keyspan is exposed to market risk arising from potential changes in one or more market variables  such as energy commodity prices  interest rates  volumetric risk due to weather or other variables 
such risk includes any or all changes in value whether caused by commodity positions  asset ownership  business or contractual obligations  debt covenants  exposure concentration  currency  weather  and other factors regardless of accounting method 
we manage our exposure to changes in market prices using various risk management techniques for non trading purposes  including hedging through the use of derivative instruments  both exchange traded and over the counter contracts  purchase of insurance and execution of other contractual arrangements 
keyspan is exposed to price risk due to investments in equity and debt securities held to fund benefit payments for various employee pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
to the extent that the value of investments held change  or long term interest rates change  the effect will be reflected in keyspan s recognition of periodic cost of such employee benefit plans and the determination of contributions to the employee benefit plans 
credit risk keyspan is exposed to credit risk arising from the potential that our counterparties fail to perform on their contractual obligations 
our credit exposures are created primarily through the sale of gas and transportation services to residential  commercial  electric generation  and industrial customers and the provision of retail access services to gas marketers  by our regulated gas businesses  the sale of commodities and services to lipa and the nyiso  the sale of power and services to our retail customers by our unregulated energy service businesses  entering into financial and energy derivative contracts with energy marketing companies and financial institutions  and the sale of gas  oil and processing services to energy marketing and oil and gas production companies 
we have regional concentration of credit risk due to receivables from residential  commercial and industrial customers in new york  new hampshire and massachusetts  although this credit risk is spread over a diversified base of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
customers payment records are monitored and action is taken  when appropriate and in accordance with various regulatory requirements 
we also have credit risk from lipa  our largest customer  and from other energy and financial services companies 
counterparty credit risk may impact overall exposure to credit risk in that our counterparties may be similarly impacted by changes in economic  regulatory or other considerations 
we actively monitor the credit profile of our wholesale counterparties in derivative and other contractual arrangements  and manage our level of exposure accordingly 
in instances where counterparties credit quality has declined  or credit exposure exceeds certain levels  we may limit our credit exposure by restricting new transactions with the counterparty  requiring additional collateral or credit support and negotiating the early termination of certain agreements 
regulatory issues and competitive environment we are subject to various other risk exposures and uncertainties associated with our gas and electric operations 
set forth below is a description of these exposures 
the gas industry long island and new york for the last several years  the nypsc has been monitoring the progress of competition in the energy market 
based upon its findings of the current market and its continued desire to move toward fully competitive markets  the nypsc  in august  issued a second policy statement 
the underlying vision remains unchanged 
the items of importance in the new policy include o elimination of a timeframe for the exit of utilities from the merchant function 
experience  time and maturation of each market customer class will dictate the exit of utilities 
o acknowledgement that competitive commodity markets for the largest customers has occurred 
however  workable competition for the mass markets ie residential and small commercial customers is taking longer and needs to be nurtured 
o future rate filings must include a plan for facilitating customer migration to competitive markets and a fully embedded cost of service study that develops unbundled rates for the utility s delivery service and all potentially competitive services 
o utilities should avoid entering into long term capacity arrangements unless it is necessary for reliability and safety purposes 
o where markets are not workably competitive  the nypsc must ensure that rates continue to be just and reasonable  and protect customers from price volatility 
on may   the nypsc issued an order adopting terms of gas restructuring joint proposal petition of keyspan energy delivery new york and keyspan energy delivery long island for a multi year restructuring agreement joint proposal 
the joint proposal did not alter base rate levels  but established a merchant function backout credit of 
dth and 
dth for kedny and kedli  respectively 
these credits are designed to lower transportation rates charged to transportation only customers 
these credits were based on established levels of projected avoided costs and levels of customer migration to non utility commodity service 
lost revenues resulting from application of these credits are recovered from firm gas sales customers 
the joint proposal expired on november  however  by order dated november  the nypsc approved tariff amendments that allow kedny and kedli to continue the merchant function backout credit and the lost revenue recovery mechanism through may  new england in july  the madte directed massachusetts gas distribution companies to undertake a collaborative process with other stakeholders to develop common principles under which comprehensive gas service unbundling might proceed 
a settlement agreement by the local distribution companies ldcs and the marketer group regarding model terms and conditions for unbundled transportation service was approved by the madte in november in february  the madte issued its order on how unbundling of natural gas service will proceed 
for a five year transition period  the madte determined that ldc contractual commitments to upstream capacity will be assigned on a mandatory  pro rata basis to marketers selling gas supply to the ldcs customers 
the approved mandatory assignment method eliminates the possibility that the costs of upstream capacity purchased by the ldcs to serve firm customers will be absorbed by the ldc or other customers through the transition period 
the madte also found that  through the transition period  ldcs will retain primary responsibility for upstream capacity planning and procurement to assure that adequate capacity is available to support customer requirements and growth 
the madte approved the ldcs terms and conditions of distribution service that conform to the settled upon model terms and conditions 
since november   all massachusetts gas customers have the option to purchase their gas supplies from third party sources other than the ldcs 
further  the new hampshire public utility commission required gas utilities to offer transportation services to all commercial and residential customers starting november  in january  the madte began a proceeding to re examine whether the upstream capacity market has been sufficiently competitive to allow voluntary capacity assignment 
keyspan submitted comments maintaining its position that the upstream capacity market is not at this time sufficiently competitive to remove or modify the madte s mandatory capacity assignment requirement 
electric industry due to volatility in the market clearing price of minute spinning and non spinning reserves during the first quarter of  the nyiso requested that ferc approve a bid cap on reserves as well as requiring a refunding of so called alleged excess payments received by sellers  including ravenswood 
on may   ferc issued an order that granted approval of a per mwh bid cap for minute non spinning reserves  plus payments for the opportunity cost of not making energy sales 
the other requests  such as a bid cap for spinning reserves  retroactive refunds  recalculation of reserve prices for march  and convening a technical conference and settlement proceeding  were rejected 
the nyiso  con edison  niagara mohawk power corporation and rochester gas and electric each individually appealed ferc s order to federal court 
the appeals were consolidated into one case by the court 
on november  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia the court issued its decision in the case of consolidated edison company of new york  inc  v 
federal energy regulatory commission decision 
essentially  the court found errors in the commission s decision and remanded some issues in the case back to the commission for further explanation and action 
the ferc has not acted on the remand 
on june   the nyiso submitted a motion to ferc seeking refunds as a result of the decision 
keyspan and others submitted statements of opposition opposing the refunds 
on november   keyspan filed a motion seeking a settlement judge be appointed to settle the case 
on january  ferc denied keyspan s request but has not yet issued a decision on the merits 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or what effect  if any  the outcome may have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the ravenswood facility and our new york city operations the nyiso s new york city local reliability rules currently require that of the electric capacity needs of new york city be provided by in city generators 
as the electric infrastructure develops and the demand for electric power increases over time in new york city and the surrounding areas  the requirement that of in city load be served by in city generators could be modified 
construction of new transmission and generation facilities could also cause significant changes to the market 
keyspan currently anticipates that approximately  mw of new capacity may be available by the end of as a result of the completion of in city generation projects currently under construction 
we cannot  however  be certain as to when  or if  the new power plants will be in operation or the nature of future new york city energy requirements or market design 
nyiso demand curve capacity market implementation on march  the nyiso made a filing at ferc seeking approval of a demand curve to be used in place of its current deficiency auction for capacity procurement 
on may   ferc approved  with some modifications  the demand curve to become effective may  on october   ferc denied various requests for rehearing of its order approving the demand curve and approved the nyiso s compliance filing 
on december   the nyiso filed its first status report with ferc with respect to how the demand curve was working 
the nyiso report found that there was no evidence of inappropriate withholding of capacity resources and that the demand curve was working as intended 
on december   the electric consumers resource council filed an appeal with the dc circuit court of appeals of ferc s may  order approving the demand curve and its october  order denying rehearing 
this appeal is still pending and we are unable to determine to what extent  if any  this proceeding will impact the ravenswood facility s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
nyiso standard market design smd the nyiso s revised market design and software smd  was implemented on february  it replaced the nyiso s current two step real time market system  which consists of the balancing market evaluation and security constrained dispatch applications  with a more integrated real time scheduling system rts 
rts uses a common computing platform  algorithms  and network models for both the real time commitment and real time dispatch functions 
this synergy between commitment and dispatch functions is expected to result in improved consistency between advisory and real time price schedules  as well as more efficient use of control area resources 
smd will more closely align the nyiso markets with the ferc standard market design notice of proposed rule making  issued on july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financially settled commodity derivative instruments hedging activities from time to time  keyspan subsidiaries have utilized derivative financial instruments  such as futures  options and swaps  for the purpose of hedging the cash flow variability associated with changes in commodity prices 
keyspan is exposed to commodity price risk primarily with regard to its gas distribution operations  gas exploration and production activities and its electric generating facilities 
our gas distribution operations utilize over the counter otc natural gas and fuel oil swaps to hedge the cash flow variability of specified portions of gas purchases and sales associated with certain large volume customers 
seneca upshur utilizes otc natural gas swaps to hedge cash flow variability associated with forecasted sales of natural gas 
the ravenswood projects use derivative financial instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with the purchase of a portion of natural gas and oil that will be consumed during the generation of electricity 
the ravenswood projects also hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of electric energy sales using otc electricity swaps 
keyspan uses standard nymex futures prices to value gas futures and market quoted forward prices to value otc swap contracts

firm gas sales derivative instruments regulated utilities we use derivative financial instruments to reduce the cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for a portion of future natural gas purchases associated with our gas distribution operations 
the accounting for these derivative instruments is subject to sfas accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet
