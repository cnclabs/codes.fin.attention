r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
as originally issued in  statement established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
statement r allows for two alternative transition methods 
the first method is the modified prospective application whereby compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under statement  as originally issued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had investments held to maturity including restricted investments held to maturity of  primarily consisting of us treasury notes with original maturities at the date of purchase of six months or less 
these highly liquid investments are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
because the company has the positive intent and ability to hold these investments until maturity  it does not expect any decline in value of its investments caused by market interest rate changes 
as of december   the company also had  in variable cumulative preferred stock from a single issuer with a dividend rate which is determined by an auction method every forty nine days 
given the nature of this security  the company does not believe the principal amount of this investment is subject to material risk 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest or dividend income 
the company has no derivative instruments  debt  or foreign operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
