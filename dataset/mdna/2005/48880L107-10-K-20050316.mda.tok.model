critical accounting polices and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated financial statements for a particular period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s net service revenues are based on fixed price contracts calculated on a percentage of completion basis based upon assumptions regarding the estimated total costs for each contract 
costs are incurred for each project and compared to the estimated budgeted costs for each contract to determine a percentage of completion on the project 
the percentage of completion is multiplied by the total contract value to determine the amount of revenue recognized 
management reviews the budget on each contract to determine if the budgeted amounts are correct  and budgets are adjusted as needed 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be changed due to changes in the scope of the work 
when estimates indicate a loss  such loss is provided in the current period in its entirety 
the company attempts to negotiate contract amendments with the sponsor to cover services provided outside the terms of the original contract 
however  there can be no guarantee that the sponsor will agree to proposed amendments  and the company ultimately bears the risk of cost overruns 
amendments to contracts resulting in revisions to revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the revisions are negotiated 
included in accounts receivable are unbilled accounts receivable  which represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
as the company provides services on projects  the company also incurs third party and other pass through costs  which are typically reimbursable by its customers pursuant to the contract 
in certain contracts  however  these costs are fixed by the contract terms 
in these contracts  the company is at risk for costs incurred in excess of the amounts fixed by the contract terms 
in these instances  the company recognizes these costs as direct costs with corresponding net service revenues 
excess costs incurred above the contract terms would affect negatively the company s gross margin 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to customers 
unbilled accounts receivable are amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to customers 
advance billings represent amounts billed or payment received for which revenues have not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on historical evidence of accounts receivable collections and specific identification of accounts receivable that might pose collection problems 
if the company is unable to collect all or part of its outstanding receivables  there could be a material impact to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
long lived assets the company analyzes goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to determine any potential impairment loss on an annual basis  unless conditions exist that require an updated analysis on an interim basis 
a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment 
the goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the reporting unit and is inherently subjective 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds fair value 
in  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
at december  and december  the fair value of the company exceeded the carrying value  resulting in no goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  the company has a million indefinite lived intangible asset representing one customer relationship acquired in the company s acquisition of cpr 
the intangible asset is evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
internally developed software the company capitalizes costs incurred to internally develop software used primarily in the company s proprietary clinical trial and data management systems  and amortizes these costs over the useful life of the product  not to exceed five years 
internally developed software represents software in the application development stage  and there is no assurance that the software development process will produce a final product for which the fair value exceeds its carrying value 
internally developed software is an intangible asset subject to impairment write downs whenever events indicate that the carrying value of the software may not be recoverable 
as with other long lived assets  this asset is reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriateness of the carrying value of the asset 
assessing the fair value of the internally developed software requires estimates and judgment on the part of management 
tax valuation allowance the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
because the company conducts business on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre tax earnings losses among jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
the company has assessed the realization of deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been established based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that realization cannot be assured 
the ultimate realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon the generation of sufficient operating income in the respective tax jurisdictions 
if estimates prove inaccurate or if the tax laws change unfavorably  significant revisions in the valuation allowance may be required in the future 
additional considerations on july   two of the company s major customers  pharmacia corp 
and pfizer inc  announced plans to merge in a stock for stock transaction 
the merger closed in the second quarter of pharmacia and pfizer combined represent approximately of the company s net service revenues for the year ended december  and approximately of the company s december   backlog 
during the second quarter of  the company identified a change  coinciding with the completion of the announced merger  in the levels of business received from the combined pfizer company 
although the level of awards received from pfizer increased during the second half of and in  the level of awards received has not reached pre merger levels 
there is no assurance that the level of business received will meet or exceed the business amounts the company received from pharmacia corp 
and pfizer inc in periods prior to the merger 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued state of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a range of share based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r replaces fas statement  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
public entities will be required to apply sfas r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact sfas r will have on its reported earnings 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the fsp provides guidance under fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act  enacted on october   creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
fsp no 
states that companies are allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fas no 
the company has evaluated the effects of the repatriation provision and does not plan to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad 
therefore  the provisions of fsp have no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  during discussions on eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  the eitf reached a consensus which requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under statements and that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
the consensus on quantitative and qualitative disclosures is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and comparative information for earlier periods presented is not required 
at the march eitf meeting  the task force reached a consensus on a three step impairment model 
except for disclosure requirements already in place  the issue consensus will be effective prospectively for all relevant current and future investments in reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard has no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency the company operates on a global basis and is therefore exposed to various types of currency risks 
two specific transaction risks arise from the nature of the contracts the company executes with its customers 
from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by the company 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net service revenues and resultant net income can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  the company recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing at the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until the payment from the customer is received will result in the company receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by the company as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from local currency into us dollars as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
foreign currency translation adjustments  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet  were million at december  compared to million at december  interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its available for sale securities and amounts outstanding under the facility and multicurrency facility 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements 
these securities are exposed to market price risk  which also takes into account interest rate risk 
at december   the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of in quoted market price would be approximately million 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the intent of managing the interest rate risk on its five year term loan 
interest rate swap agreements are contractual agreements between two parties for the exchange of interest payment streams on a principal amount and an agreed upon fixed or floating rate  for a defined period of time
