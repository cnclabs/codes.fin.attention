the economic slowdown  which began in mid  became an economic recession in  and was characterized by weak industrial markets throughout and the industrial economy began to strengthen in early in our served markets 
net sales in increased  including the impact of the ge commercial ac motor acquisition in august  to million 
net income rose to million 
rising material costs  particularly copper  steel and aluminum  presented the most significant negative impact to our profitability in by the fourth quarter  spot prices for steel and copper were approximately double the level from the prior year 
we implemented various price increases three times during the year  with the last taking effect in december 
the price increases only partially offset the material cost increases 
we made two significant acquisitions during the year 
on august  we completed the acquisition of general electric s commercial ac motor business for million in cash 
the commercial ac motors business  which is projected to add approximately million in annual sales  manufactures a full line of ac motors for pump  compressor  equipment and commercial hvac applications 
on december   we completed the acquisition of general electric s hvac motors and capacitors businesses hvac business for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
the hvac business is projected to add approximately million in annual sales and manufactures a full line of electric motors for use principally in residential hvac systems and capacitors for hvac systems  high intensity lighting and other applications 
we enter encouraged about the prospects for our legacy businesses as well as the newly acquired businesses 
the overall market conditions continue to be positive  driven by consumer and business spending 
raw material prices continue to have a negative impact on margins even after the price increases were put into effect in we plan to continue to address the margin pressures through price increases and productivity improvements in results of operations versus our net sales were million in  a increase from million in excluding the sales impact from the acquisition of the cac business  sales increased 
the increase in sales was driven by strong demand in the majority of our markets 
sales in the electrical segment increased to million 
excluding the sales from the cac business  sales in the electrical segment were million  an increase of over sales for the joint ventures that the company owned for the entire year  which are included in the electrical segment  increased million  or over sales in our mechanical segment were million  which was an increase of over sales in both segments were positively impacted by improved consumer and business spending and the price increases implemented by the company during our gross profit was million  an increase of over the million reported in as a percent of sales  gross profit was as compared to in the increase in raw material costs drove this decrease  as price increases and our implemented productivity actions only partially offset the increased costs 
our operating expenses in were million  above million in the increase was primarily driven by the sales and distribution costs driven by the sales volume increase 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in  reflecting fixed cost leverage and productivity 
income from operations was million  an increase of over the million reported in income from operations as a percentage of sales operating income margin was in versus in electrical segment income from operations increased in to million from million in  and operating income margin decreased to in from in the impact of the raw material cost increases coupled with an increase in healthcare costs for employees were the primary drivers of this decrease 
these factors were partially offset by price increases  favorable volume impacts  and the operating expense fixed cost leveraging and productivity 
mechanical segment income from operations increased to million in from million in the mechanical segment operating income margin for improved to from in the results of the mechanical segment reflect the positive impacts of increased volume  price increases  and the rd quarter gain on the sale of property located in the uk million pretax  partially offset by raw material cost increases 
our net interest expense in was million  which was an increase of over the million in this increase was due to a slightly increased balance of average debt outstanding 
the average interest rate we paid on outstanding debt in was which was unchanged from the average in our effective tax rate on income before taxes decreased to in from in  including tax effects of the minority interest 
this decrease was due primarily to the impact of the favorable resolution of several tax matters recorded in the fourth quarter million and the favorable tax treatment of the third quarter gain on the sale of property located in the u

our net income of million improved from the million in net income as a percentage of sales was versus in basic earnings per share was in  a increase from in fully diluted earnings per share was  a increase from in versus our net sales were million in  a increase from million in the higher sales were attributable to our electrical segment  whose net sales of million were improved from s million 
this sales increase was due primarily to strength in our power generator and related controls products  including our generator joint venture in china  particularly in the second half of the increase in the generator and control sales was due primarily to an overall improvement in market demand as progressed  in part aided by the impact of the northeast power outage  hurricane isabel and middle east rebuilding projects 
sales of our electric motor products were virtually unchanged in from mechanical segment net sales of million were below million in and were basically flat throughout  reflecting broad based weakness in our markets 
our gross profit rose in to million from million the previous year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin in of was virtually unchanged from  although increasing to in the fourth quarter of above the average margin of the first nine months of the fourth quarter gross profit margin increase above the rest of was due primarily to improved manufacturing productivity and the completion of moving production from three of our factories  which are for the most part now closed  into several of our other facilities

our interest expense in decreased following a decrease in  to million from million in  due primarily to a combination of lower average interest rates in the united states in than in and to our lower average debt outstanding 
the average interest rate we paid on outstanding debt in was  following a average in our effective tax rate on income before taxes increased to in from in this increase was due primarily to the impact of one time tax refunds we received in our net income of million was improved from million in net income as a percentage of sales of in was virtually unchanged from basic earnings per share was in and  while diluted earnings per share was compared to a year earlier 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital was million at december   an increase of from million at december  the increase was due primarily to a million increase in current assets partly offset by a million increase in current liabilities 
accounts receivable increased million during  of which million resulted from the acquisitions of businesses from ge and the remainder from the increased sales volume 
accounts payable increased million in  with resulting from the acquisitions and a general increase in accounts payable due to improved business activity at the end of versus at the end of other accrued expenses increased million in as a result of the acquisitions due 
our current ratio at december  decreased to from at year end cash flow from operations was million in  a decrease from million in increases in inventories and receivables resulting from the increased sales volumes  in part offset by higher payables  account for the decrease 
cash flow used in investing activities totaled million versus million in capital spending decreased by million to million 
the net cash paid for the acquisitions of the cac and hvac businesses totaled million 
offsetting these investments were the proceeds from the sale of facilities and equipment  which totaled million 
our commitments for property  plant and equipment as of december  were approximately million 
we believe that our present facilities  augmented by planned capital expenditures  are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in cash flow provided by financing activities was million  as funds were obtained to finance our acquisitions 
the addition to long term debt of million represents the gross proceeds of the convertible senior subordinated debt offering we completed in april we repurchased million of our common stock simultaneously with the closing of the debt offering 
the aggregate financing fees of million were associated with the debt offering and our amended and restated credit agreement on december  the net borrowings of long term debt of million reflects using the million net proceeds of the debt offering to repay loans under our credit facility  the borrowing of approximately million under our credit facility to fund the cash portions of our two acquisitions and million net repayments of long term debt provided by our business operations 
we paid million in dividends during our primary financing source is our million long term unsecured revolving credit facility the facility that expires on may  the facility was increased by million in december from the previous million 
the facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests 
we were in compliance with all of these ratios and tests as of december  those tests consist of a minimum interest coverage ratio of to  a maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio of to  a maximum senior funded debt to ebitda ratio of to  and a minimum net worth consisting of the sum of million plus of net income for each quarter ending after march  plus of the net proceeds of all issuances of equity securities by the company 
at year end  we had million of available borrowing capacity 
we believe we will satisfy the financial ratios and tests specified in the facility for the foreseeable future 
we also believe that the combination of our operating cash flow  which has averaged over million per year over the last three years and we believe is indicative of what we might achieve in  and borrowing availability under the facility will provide sufficient cash flow to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of our capital structure  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
except for the million of convertible senior subordinated debt  virtually all our debt is under the facility with a variable interest rate based on a margin above libor 
as a result  interest rate changes impact our future earnings and cash flows assuming other factors are constant 
a hypothetical change in the libor rate on the facility debt outstanding at december  would result in an annual after tax change in net income of  we had no material foreign currency rate risk at december  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations and payments due by period as of december  in thousands payments due by period long term debt including estimated interest payments operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total variable rate debt based on december  rates

retirement plans approximately half of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the remaining employees covered by defined contribution plans 
our obligations under the defined benefit plans are determined with the assistance of actuarial firms 
the actuaries make certain assumptions regarding such factors as withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuaries also provide us with information and recommendations from which management makes further assumptions on such factors as the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate on benefit obligations and where applicable  the rate of annual compensation increases 
based upon the assumptions made  the investments made by the plans  overall conditions and movement in financial markets  particularly the stock market and how actual withdrawal rates  life spans of benefit recipients and other factors differ from assumptions  annual expenses and recorded assets or liabilities of these defined benefit plans may change significantly from year to year 
based on our annual review of actuarial assumptions as well as historical rates of return on plan assets and existing long term bond rates  we set the long term rate of return on plan assets at and the discount rate at for our defined benefit plans as of december  see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
further discussion of the company s accounting policies is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
