executive overview we are a self managed  self administered  fully integrated real estate investment trust reit that is engaged in the ownership  development  acquisition  leasing  management and operation of regional shopping malls and community centers 
our shopping center properties are located primarily in the southeast and midwest  as well as in select markets in other regions of the united states 
as of december   we owned controlling interests in regional malls  associated centers each adjacent to a regional mall  community centers  and our corporate office building 
we consolidate the financial statements of all entities in which we have a controlling financial interest 
as of december   we owned non controlling interests in five regional malls  one associated center and community centers 
because major decisions such as the acquisition  sale or refinancing of principal partnership or joint venture assets must be approved by one or more of the other partners  we do not control these partnerships and joint ventures and  accordingly  account for these investments using the equity method 
we had one mall  which is owned in a joint venture  two mall expansions  one open air shopping center  two associated centers  one of which is owned in a joint venture  one associated center expansion  one associated center redevelopment and three community centers under construction as of december  the majority of our revenues is derived from leases with retail tenants and generally include minimum rents  percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for expenditures related to property operating expenses  real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs  as well as certain capital expenditures 
we also generate revenues from sales of peripheral land at the properties and from sales of real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize the maximum value of the assets 
proceeds from such sales are generally used to reduce borrowings on our credit facilities 
we expanded our portfolio in with the acquisition of eight malls  two associated centers and a community center  representing a total investment of million 
we opened nine new developments totaling million square feet  including the nearly million square foot regional mall coastal grand myrtle beach in myrtle beach  sc  which we own in a joint venture 
we have approximately million square feet of new developments  which represent over million of net investment  that is scheduled to open during we also added a total of big box stores and eight anchor retailers to our malls  which have made positive contributions by strengthening the tenant mix of these properties 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following significant transactions impacted the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  x the acquisition of eight malls  two associated centers and one community center  and the opening of one new mall which is accounted for using the equity method  one associated center and one community center during additionally  was the first full year of operations for the six malls and two associated centers that were acquired during and the one associated center and two community centers that were opened in the properties opened or acquired during and are collectively referred to as the new properties in this section and are as follows property location date acquired opened acquisitions sunrise mall brownsville  tx april sunrise commons brownsville  tx april cross creek mall fayetteville  nc september river ridge mall lynchburg  va october valley view mall roanoke  va october southpark mall colonial heights  va december harford mall bel air  md december harford annex bel air  md december honey creek mall terre haute  in march volusia mall daytona beach  fl march greenbrier mall chesapeake  va april fashion square orange park  fl april chapel hill mall akron  oh may chapel hill suburban akron  oh may park plaza mall little rock  ar june monroeville mall monroeville  pa july monroeville annex monroeville  pa july northpark mall joplin  mo november mall del norte laredo  tx november new developments the shoppes at hamilton place chattanooga  tn may cobblestone village st

we sold six additional community centers to galileo america in january since we have continuing involvement with these properties through our ownership interest in galileo america and our role as manager of the properties  the results of operations of these properties have not been reflected in discontinued operations 
therefore  the year ended december  includes results of operations for these properties through the dates they were sold 
x effective january   we began to consolidate the results of operations of ppg venture i limited partnership  which owns two community centers and one associated center the ppg properties  as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement 
the ppg properties were accounted for as unconsolidated affiliates using the equity method of accounting prior to january  x properties that were in operation for the entire period during and are referred to as the comparable properties in this section 
revenues the million increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases of million from the new properties  million related to the ppg properties and million from the comparable properties 
these increases were offset by a reduction in revenues of million related to the community centers that were sold to galileo america in october and january the increase in revenues of the comparable properties was driven by our ability to maintain high occupancy levels  while achieving an increase of in rents from both new leases and lease renewals for comparable small shop spaces 
an increase in management and leasing fees of million received from galileo america was the primary contributor to the million increase in management  development and leasing fees 
other revenues increased million due to growth of our taxable reit subsidiary 
operating expenses property operating expenses including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs  increased as a result of increases of million from the new properties and million from the ppg properties  offset by decreases of million related to the community centers that were sold to galileo america and million in operating expenses of the comparable properties 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from increases of million from the new properties  million related to the ppg properties and million from the comparable properties 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million related to the community centers that we sold to galileo america in october and january the increase attributable to the comparable properties is due to ongoing capital expenditures for renovations  expansions  tenant allowances and deferred maintenance 
general and administrative expenses increased million during as a percentage of revenues  this was only a increase over the comparable amount 
general and administrative expenses were significantly impacted by an additional million of expenses in related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of state tax expenses also increased million as a result of our continued growth 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to additional salaries and benefits for the personnel added to manage the properties acquired during and combined with annual compensation increases for existing personnel 
we identified ten community centers and recorded a loss on impairment of real estate assets of million to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their respective estimated fair values 
the ten community centers include four community centers that we sold to galileo america in january  five community centers that we expect to sell during the first quarter of and one community center that was sold for a loss during the fourth quarter of other income and expenses interest expense increased million primarily due to the debt on the new properties and the ppg properties  as well as the additional financings that were obtained on the comparable properties 
the increase was offset by a reduction in interest expense related to the galileo transaction as well as normal principal amortization 
the gain on sales of real estate assets of million in included million of gain related to the galileo transaction and million of gain on sales of seven outparcels at various properties 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by million in as a result of our interest in galileo america and the opening of coastal grand myrtle beach in march we sold two community centers during for a gain on discontinued operations of million 
we sold one community center for a loss of million  which was included in loss on impairment of real estate assets 
operating income from discontinued operations decreased in because the properties were owned for a shorter period of time in than in  and because includes the operations of properties that were sold during comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following significant transactions impacted the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  x the acquisition of six malls and two associated centers and the opening of one new associated center and two new community centers during additionally  there was a full year of operations in for three malls and one associated center that were acquired during and one associated center that was opened in the properties opened or acquired during and are collectively referred to as the new properties and are as follows property location date acquired opened acquisitions richland mall waco  tx may panama city mall panama city  fl may westmoreland mall greensburg  pa december westmoreland crossing greensburg  pa december sunrise mall brownsville  tx april sunrise commons brownsville  tx april cross creek mall fayetteville  nc september river ridge mall lynchburg  va october valley view mall roanoke  va october southpark mall colonial heights  va december harford mall bel air  md december harford annex bel air  md december new developments parkdale crossing beaumont  tx november the shoppes at hamilton place chattanooga  tn may cobblestone village st

x the sale of interests in community centers to galileo america in october the galileo transaction 
x properties that were in operation for the entire period during and are referred to as the comparable properties in this section 
revenues the million increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases of million from the new properties  million from the newly consolidated properties and million from properties that were in operation for all of and  offset by a reduction of million from the galileo transaction 
the increase in revenues at properties that were in operation for all of and was primarily driven by our ability to maintain high occupancy levels while achieving increases in rents from both new leases and lease renewals on comparable spaces 
additionally  our cost recovery ratio improved to in compared to in due primarily to the partial recovery of certain capital expenditures incurred in connection with the significant number of mall renovations completed during the past three years 
management  leasing and development fees decreased million because of a reduction in fees related to the newly consolidated properties 
operating expenses property operating expenses including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs increased million due to increases of million from the new properties and million from the newly consolidated properties  offset by a reduction of million from the galileo transaction 
the million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from increases of million from the new properties  million from the newly consolidated properties and million from the comparable centers  which is primarily attributable to the property renovations and expansions that were completed during and these increases were offset by a reduction of million from the galileo transaction 
general and administrative expenses increased million because we had a lower level of development activity in than in as a result  we capitalized less in salaries of leasing and development personnel  which resulted in higher compensation expense 
there were also additional salaries and benefits for the personnel added to manage the properties acquired during and combined with annual compensation increases for existing personnel 
other income and expenses interest expense increased million due to the debt on the new properties and the newly consolidated properties 
we also refinanced million of short term  variable rate debt with fixed rate  non recourse long term debt with a higher interest rate 
the increase was offset somewhat by a reduction in debt related to the galileo transaction and normal principal amortization 
while converting to fixed rate debt is dilutive in the short term  it is consistent with our strategy of minimizing exposure to variable rate debt when we can obtain fixed rate debt on terms that are deemed favorable for the long term 
the net gain on sales of real estate assets of million in was primarily attributable to the million gain recognized on the galileo transaction 
the remaining million of gain was related to gains on sales of outparcels at various properties and sales of two options on potential development sites 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by million in as a result of the newly consolidated properties no longer being accounted for using the equity method 
we sold six community centers during for a gain on discontinued operations of million 
operating income from discontinued operations decreased in because the properties were owned for a shorter period of time in than in  and because includes the operations of properties that were sold during operational review the shopping center business is  to some extent  seasonal in nature with tenants achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season 
additionally  the malls earn most of their short term rents during the holiday period 
thus  occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year 
we classify our regional malls into two categories malls that have completed their initial lease up are referred to as stabilized malls and malls that are in their initial lease up phase are referred to as non stabilized malls 
the non stabilized malls currently include the lakes mall in muskegon  mi  which opened in august  parkway place in huntsville  al  which opened in october  and coastal grand myrtle beach in myrtle beach  sc  which opened in march we derive a significant amount of our revenues from the mall properties 
the sources of our revenues by property type were as follows year ended december  malls associated centers community centers mortgages  office building and other sales and occupancy costs mall store sales for those tenants who occupy  square feet or less and have reported sales in the stabilized malls increased by on a comparable per square foot basis to per square foot for compared with per square foot for occupancy costs as a percentage of sales for the stabilized malls were and for and  respectively 
occupancy total portfolio occupancy increased basis points to 
since june  we experienced store closings  totaling approximately  square feet and representing approximately million in annual minimum base rent 
as of december   we had re leased approximately  square feet of this space at rents per square foot that are higher than the previous rent and at comparable rents based on total annual base rent 
our portfolio occupancy is summarized in the following table december  total portfolio total mall portfolio stabilized malls non stabilized malls associated centers community centers excludes the community centers that were sold in phases i and ii of the galileo transaction leasing average annual base rents per square foot were as follows for each property type december  stabilized malls non stabilized malls associated centers community centers excludes the community centers that were sold in phases i and ii of the galileo transaction

liquidity and capital resources there was million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of december   an increase of million from december  cash flows from operations are used to fund short term liquidity and capital needs such as tenant construction allowances  capital expenditures and payments of dividends and distributions 
for longer term liquidity needs such as acquisitions  new developments  renovations and expansions  we typically rely on property specific mortgages which are generally non recourse  construction and term loans  revolving lines of credit  common stock  preferred stock  joint venture investments and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the operations of the new properties and improved results at the comparable properties

in august  we entered into a new million unsecured credit facility  which bears interest at libor plus a margin of to basis points based on our leverage  as defined in the agreement 
the credit facility matures in august and we have three one year extension options 
we used borrowings on the credit facility to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our previous million unsecured credit facility  which had an interest rate of libor plus and was scheduled to mature in september at december   total outstanding borrowings of million under the new credit facility had a weighted average interest rate of 
we currently have four secured lines of credit with total availability of million that are used for construction  acquisition and working capital purposes 
each of these lines is secured by mortgages on certain of our operating properties

there was million outstanding under these lines at december  we obtained a million  nonrecourse loan secured by eastgate mall in cincinnati  oh that bears interest at and matures in december we assumed million of debt and obtained an additional million of debt to fund the acquisitions completed during the assumed loans bear interest at stated fixed rates ranging from to and mature at various dates from march to december since the stated interest rates on the fixed rate loans were above market rates for similar debt instruments as of the respective dates of acquisition  debt premiums of million were recorded to reflect the assumed debt at estimated fair values

the additional loans include million of loans that bear interest at libor plus basis points and mature in april and may  and a fixed rate  interest only  nonrecourse loan of million that bears interest at and matures in december the secured and unsecured credit facilities contain  among other restrictions  certain financial covenants including the maintenance of certain coverage ratios  minimum net worth requirements  and limitations on cash flow distributions 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions under our credit facilities at december  additionally  certain property specific mortgage notes payable require the maintenance of debt service coverage ratios on their respective properties 
at december   the properties subject to these mortgage notes payable were in compliance with the applicable ratios 
we expect to refinance the majority of mortgage and other notes payable maturing over the next five years with replacement loans 
based on our pro rata share of total debt  there is million of debt that is scheduled to mature in there are extension options in place to extend the maturity of million of this debt to we repaid million of these loans subsequent to december   and expect to repay the remaining million of maturing loans 
equity on december   we issued  depositary shares in a public offering  each representing one tenth of a share of series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock the series d preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share per depositary share 
the dividends on the series d preferred stock are cumulative  accrue from the date of issuance and are payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of per share per depositary share per annum 
the series d preferred stock has no stated maturity  is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption  and is not redeemable before december  the net proceeds of million were used to reduce outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities 
we received million in proceeds from issuances of common stock during from exercises of employee stock options  our dividend reinvestment plan and our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we paid dividends of million to holders of our common stock and our preferred stock  as well as million in distributions to the minority interest investors in our operating partnership and certain shopping center properties 
as a publicly traded company  we have access to capital through both the public equity and debt markets 
we have an effective shelf registration statement authorizing us to publicly issue shares of preferred stock  common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock with an aggregate public offering price up to million  of which million remains after the series d preferred stock offering 
we anticipate that the combination of equity and debt sources will  for the foreseeable future  provide adequate liquidity to continue our capital programs substantially as in the past and make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts 
our policy is to maintain a conservative debt to total market capitalization ratio in order to enhance our access to the broadest range of capital markets  both public and private 
based on our share of total consolidated and unconsolidated debt and the market value of our equity  our debt to total market capitalization debt plus market value equity ratio was as follows at december  in thousands  except stock prices shares outstanding stock price value common stock and operating partnership units   series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock   series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock  series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock  total market equity  our share of total debt  total market capitalization  debt to total market capitalization ratio stock price for common stock and operating partnership units equals the closing price of our common stock on december  the stock price for the preferred stock represents the liquidation preference of each respective series of preferred stock

the contracts are primarily for development  renovation and expansion of properties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the master lease obligation to galileo america 
the future contractual obligations shown above only include the remaining obligation that was recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at december  capital expenditures we expect to continue to have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken as suitable opportunities arise 
we do not expect to pursue these activities unless adequate sources of financing are available and we can achieve satisfactory returns on our investments 
an annual capital expenditures budget is prepared for each property that is intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non recurring capital expenditures 
we believe that property operating cash flows  which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses  will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures 
developments and expansions the following is a summary of the projects currently under construction dollars in thousands our share of gross our cost as of scheduled leasable share of december  opening property location area total cost date new mall developments imperial valley mall joint venture el centro  ca    march mall expansions citadel mall charleston  sc   august fayette mall lexington  ky    october open air center southaven towne center southaven  ms    october associated centers coolsprings crossing tweeters nashville  tn   march hamilton corner chattanooga  tn    march the district at monroeville mall monroeville  pa    april coastal grand crossing myrtle beach  sc   april community centers cobblestone village at royal palm royal palm  fl    june chicopee marketplace chicopee  ma    august fashion square orange park  fl   july there are construction loans in place for the costs of the new mall and open air center developments 
the costs of the remaining projects will be funded with operating cash flows and the credit facilities 
we have entered into a number of option agreements for the development of future regional malls and community centers 
except for the projects listed in the above table  we do not have any other material capital commitments 
acquisitions we acquired eight malls  two associated centers and a community center during for an aggregate purchase price of million  including transaction costs 
we paid million in cash  assumed million of debt  agreed to pay million for land at a future date and issued limited partnership interests in our operating partnership valued at million to fund these acquisitions 
the cash portions of the purchase prices were funded with borrowings under our credit facilities and the three new loans totaling million 
these acquisitions are expected to generate an initial weighted average  unleveraged return of 
dispositions during  we generated aggregate net proceeds of million from the galileo transaction  the sales of four community centers and one community center expansion and the sales of nine outparcels 
the net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under our credit facilities 
in january  we sold two power centers  one community center and a community center expansion to galileo america 
the net proceeds of million were used to reduce outstanding balances under our lines of credit 
other capital expenditures including our share of unconsolidated affiliates capital expenditures  we spent million in for tenant allowances  which generate increased rents from tenants over the terms of their leases 
deferred maintenance expenditures were million for and included million for resurfacing and improved lighting of parking lots  million for roof repairs and replacements and million for various other expenditures 
renovation expenditures were million in deferred maintenance expenditures are billed to tenants as common area maintenance expense  and most are recovered over a to year period 
renovation expenditures are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of malls  of which approximately is recovered from tenants over a to year period 
we expect to renovate two malls during at a total estimated cost of million  which will be funded from operating cash flows and availability under our credit facilities 
one of the renovation projects will be completed in and the other will be completed in off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated affiliates we have ownership interests in nine unconsolidated affiliates that are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the following are circumstances when we may consider entering into a joint venture with a third party x third parties may approach us with opportunities where they have obtained land and performed some pre development activities  but they may not have sufficient access to the capital resources or the development and leasing expertise to bring the project to fruition 
we enter into such arrangements when we determine such a project is viable and we can achieve a satisfactory return on our investment 
we typically earn development fees from the joint venture and provide management and leasing services to the property once it is placed in operation 
x we determine that we may have the opportunity to capitalize on the value we have created in a property by selling an interest in the property to a third party 
this provides us with an additional source of capital that can be used to develop or acquire additional real estate assets that we believe will provide greater potential for growth 
when we retain an interest in an asset rather than selling a interest  it is typically because this allows us to continue to manage the property  which provides us the ability to earn fees for management  leasing  development  financing and acquisition services provided to the joint venture 
guarantees we have guaranteed of the debt to be incurred to develop the property owned by imperial valley mall lp and of the debt of parkway place lp we have issued these guarantees primarily because it allows the joint ventures to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise 
this results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment  and in a higher return on our investment in the joint venture 
we may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty 
additionally  when we are required to perform under a guaranty  the terms of the guaranty typically provide that the joint venture partners interests in the joint venture is assigned to us  to the extent of our guaranty 
we had guaranteed the debt incurred to develop the property owned by mall of south carolina lp and had received a fee for the guaranty 
this debt was refinanced during by mall of south carolina lp and  as a result  the guaranty was terminated 
we recognized revenues of million and million related to this guaranty during and  respectively 
the company s guarantees and the related accounting are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion describes our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related leases 
certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements 
percentage rent is recognized as revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable 
we receive reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in the lease agreements 
tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the related operating expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements related to certain capital expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of to years and are recognized as revenue when billed 
we receive management  leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates 
management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues as defined in the management agreement and are recognized as revenue when earned 
development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period 
leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals and are recognized as revenue when earned 
development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates during the development period are recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized when it is determined that the sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate  our receivable  if any  is not subject to future subordination  and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 
when we have an ownership interest in the buyer  gain is recognized to the extent of the third party partner s ownership interest and the portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred 
real estate assets we capitalize predevelopment project costs paid to third parties 
all previously capitalized predevelopment costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the project will be completed 
once development of a project commences  all direct costs incurred to construct the project  including interest and real estate taxes  are capitalized 
additionally  certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based on the amount of time applicable personnel work on the development project 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
all acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
the purchase price is allocated to i tangible assets  consisting of land  buildings and improvements  and tenant improvements and ii identifiable intangible assets generally consisting of above and below market leases and in place leases 
we use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows  using appropriate discount rates  and other valuation methods to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets 
liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired 
assumed debt with a stated interest rate that is significantly different from market interest rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated market interest rates at the date of acquisition 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over estimated lives of years for buildings  to years for certain improvements and to years for equipment and fixtures 
tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
lease related intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases 
the amortization of above and below market leases is recorded as an adjustment to minimum rental revenue  while the amortization of all other lease related intangibles is recorded as amortization expense 
any difference between the face value of the debt assumed and its fair value is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method 
carrying value of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value is charged to operations 
we recorded losses on the impairment of real estate assets of  in  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there were no impairment charges in and recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
we determined that one unconsolidated affiliate  ppg venture i limited partnership ppg  is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary 
we began consolidating the assets  liabilities and results of operations of ppg effective january  we initially measured the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of ppg at the carrying amounts at which they would have been carried in the consolidated financial statements as if fin r had been effective when we first met the conditions to be the primary beneficiary  which was the inception of ppg 
we own a interest in ppg  which owns one associated center and two community centers

impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect us from the impact of inflation 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis 
we compute ffo as defined above by nareit less dividends on preferred stock 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
we believe that ffo provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time 
since values of well maintained real estate assets have historically risen with market conditions  we believe that ffo enhances investors understanding of our operating performance 
the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our properties and interest rates  but also by our capital structure 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ffo increased in to million compared to million in the new properties generated of the growth in ffo 
consistently high portfolio occupancy  increases in rental rates from new and renewal leasing and increased recoveries of operating expenses primarily accounted for the remaining growth in ffo 
the calculation of ffo is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders    add depreciation and amortization from consolidated properties    depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated affiliates    depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations minority interest in earnings of operating partnership    less gains on sales of operating real estate assets   minority investors share of depreciation and amortization    gain on discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets funds from operations    ffo applicable to our shareholders    supplemental ffo information lease termination fees    straight line rental income    gains on outparcel sales    amortization of acquired above and below market leases  amortization of debt premiums  gain on sales of nonoperating properties  loss on impairment of real estate assets  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and derivative financial instruments 
we have used derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and not for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk management policy requires that we use derivative instruments for hedging purposes only and that they be entered into only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 
based on our proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable rate debt at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase or decrease annual cash flows by approximately million and  after the effect of capitalized interest  annual earnings by approximately million 
based on our proportionate share of total consolidated and unconsolidated debt at december   a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million  while a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately million
