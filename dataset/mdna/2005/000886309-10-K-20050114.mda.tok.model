item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation marketplace conditions our operating results for fiscal continued to stabilize  a trend that began in fiscal however  overall spending on communications equipment and services remains at significantly lower levels compared to pre levels 
although there have been increases in capital investment in selected areas including fiber to the x initiatives by several communications service providers  a general increase in wireless spending and some signs of growth in enterprise spending  our industry continues to see deferred capital spending for communications equipment 
in addition  there are indications that customers who are initiating new spending on fiber to the x may reduce their spending levels on non fiber products 
our industry also continues to experience intense competition and increased pricing pressures from customers 
while we expect the overall market for communication equipment and services to grow slowly in the near term  we believe that we are positioned to grow our sales better than the overall market in our fiscal year we believe we can achieve this sales growth by focusing on new product offerings for the fiber to the x initiative being pursued by several communication service providers and the growing acceptance of our digivance wireless coverage solution and our truenet and copperten enterprise solutions  opportunities to cross sell products among the traditional krone and adc customer bases  of which there is very little overlap  and taking market share from our competitors as we have recently done with respect to some of our product lines 
although we anticipate revenue growth in  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in achieving this goal 
we continue to be dependent on telecommunications service providers for a majority of our revenues  with the four major us incumbent local exchange carriers verizon  bellsouth  sbc and qwest accounting for approximately  and of our revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  our top ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in these customer concentration levels from to is largely due to the krone acquisition  which has given us a more diversified customer base throughout the world 
this increased diversification may be offset by mergers among our customers  like those recently announced between cingular and at t wireless and between sprint and nextel 
the long term impact these types of mergers may have on our business is difficult to predict 
further  in the shorter term we believe parties to these types of mergers may be inclined to defer spending decisions while they are attempting to integrate their operations  which may have an adverse impact on our business 
consolidation among our competitors or our vendors could also cause changes to our business that are not readily predictable 
when the downturn in communications equipment spending first became evident in fiscal  we implemented a cost restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and capital spending 
as it became evident in and that our industry was experiencing a more pronounced and prolonged economic downturn  we took additional cost restructuring measures to realize further cost savings 
although much of our restructuring activity has been completed  we continue to look for ways to conduct our operations more efficiently and to reduce costs 
for example  the integration of the krone acquisition has presented opportunities to reduce costs through eliminating duplicative facilities  processes and general and administration functions 
accordingly  we anticipate incurring additional restructuring charges in future periods 
historically  our results of operations had been subject to seasonal factors  with stronger demand for our products during our fourth fiscal quarter ending october primarily as a result of customer budget cycles and our fiscal year end initiatives and weaker demand for our products during our first fiscal quarter ending january primarily as a result of the number of holidays in that quarter  our customers development of annual capital budgets during that period and a general industry slowdown during that period 
this historical seasonality trend in our business returned in fiscal and we presently expect it to exist in fiscal a more detailed description of the risks to our business related to seasonality  along with other risk factors associated with our business  can be found in item under the caption risk factors 
during fiscal  we took several significant steps to further our strategic business initiative to be a global leader in communications network infrastructure solutions and services 
first  we completed the acquisition of krone 
secondly  we completed the divestitures of our broadaccess business  cuda cable modem termination system and fastflow broadband provisioning manager businesses  singl 
eview software business and announced the sale of our metrica service assurance software business 
the metrica divestiture was completed shortly after the end of the fiscal year 
these actions will enable us to focus on our strategy of providing products and services that connect every type of communications network over copper  fiber  coaxial and wireless media 
as discussed in part i of this form k  the krone acquisition has several significant strategic elements which we believe will benefit adc in the long term 
since the closing of the krone acquisition in may  we have been working diligently to integrate the operations of the two companies and execute on the opportunities that this acquisition provides 
we intend to continue to explore additional product line or business acquisitions that are complimentary to our communications infrastructure business 
we expect to fund any potential acquisition with existing cash resources  the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock  the issuance of debt or equity linked securities or through some combination of these alternatives

eview product line 
we also entered into an agreement to sell the business related to our metrica service assurance software group 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  these businesses were classified as discontinued operations in fiscal and the financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on may   we completed the acquisition of krone  a global supplier of connectivity solutions and cabling products used in public access and enterprise networks  from gentek  inc this acquisition increased our network infrastructure business and expanded our presence in the international marketplace 
the results of krone subsequent to may  are included in our results of operations 
net sales fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  which was a increase 
international net sales were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  net sales of broadband infrastructure and access products increased by compared to fiscal our broadband infrastructure and access segment includes infrastructure connectivity and access wireless and wireline products 
the inclusion of sales by the krone group beginning on may   accounts for of the increase for fiscal with the remaining increase being accounted for primarily through increased sales of connectivity and wireless products 
for fiscal  sales of our connectivity and wireless increased and  respectively  compared to fiscal the inclusion of million in sales by krone beginning on may   as well as fiber to the x sales  accounted for of the increase in connectivity product sales for fiscal the remaining increase in connectivity sales was attributable primarily to increased spending by our customers in the core central office space 
wireless sales increased primarily due to growing acceptance of our digivance product 
for fiscal  net sales of our wireline products decreased by over the comparable period 
the decrease in wireline product sales was caused by a combination of decreased volumes and price reductions resulting from decreased demand for certain types of products within the industry generally and competitive pressures 
net sales of our professional services segment increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the inclusion of krone s professional services business krone services resulted in a million increase in net sales in fiscal this increase  however  was partially offset by a decline in sales of adc s historical professional services 
excluding krone services  a significant customer of our professional services segment represented of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decreased spending by this customer  however  was largely offset by market share gains with other customers 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease 
international net sales comprised and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in net sales was attributable largely to lower volumes of products sold due to significant reductions in communication service provider capital budgets  as well as the lack of new network build outs or significant expansions of existing networks 
gross profit fiscal vs 
fiscal gross profit percentages were and during fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due to a more favorable sales mix toward higher margin products and a reduction in our fixed costs of sales as a result of our restructuring activities 
we also benefited from production efficiencies and reduced production costs resulting from more favorable supplier pricing derived from better purchasing power due to the krone acquisition and the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing operations 
we anticipate that our future gross profit percentage will vary based on many factors  including sales mix  competitive pricing  timing of new product introductions  timing of customer acceptance and collectibility of significant sales transactions and manufacturing volume 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal and  gross profit percentages were and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due to a more favorable sales mix toward higher margin connectivity products  our decision not to bid on low margin professional services projects and a reduction in our fixed costs of sales as a result of our restructuring activities 
operating expenses fiscal vs 
fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
included in these operating expenses were restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  and impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
krone operating expenses were million in fiscal excluding krone  operating expenses decreased in fiscal although the largest factor in the decrease in operating expenses was the reduction in the amount of our restructuring and impairment charges  our operating expenses also declined due to the ongoing cost savings from our restructuring efforts 
research and development research and development expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  which represents a decrease of 
krone represented of the fiscal expense 
we believe that  given the rapidly changing technological and competitive environment in the communications equipment industry  continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive 
accordingly  we intend to continue to allocate substantial resources  as a percentage of net sales  to product development in each of our operating segments 
selling and administration selling and administration expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal krone was of the increase in fiscal the remaining increase is due to million of krone integration costs and million of increased incentive accruals  which were partially offset by million of decreased occupancy costs resulting from ongoing restructuring 
note that in we expect to incur significant administrative expense associated with our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
this section of the act will require us to conduct a thorough evaluation of our internal controls and we will be working with independent advisors in this process 
impairment charges impairment charges represent a write down of the carrying value of fixed assets to their estimated fair market value 
these charges declined in fiscal compared to fiscal million compared to million 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge for a building included in assets held for sale when it was determined the carrying value exceeded market value 
the fair market value was determined based on an examination of sales prices for similar properties 
the fiscal impairment charges consisted solely of property and equipment impairments  which impacted both the broadband infrastructure and access segment and the professional services segment  and were caused by our plan to dispose of excess equipment 
the fair market value of this equipment was determined using external sources  primarily proceeds received from previous equipment sales or estimates of discounted cash flows 
restructuring charges restructuring charges represent the direct costs of certain leased facilities and severance costs for workforce reductions 
our restructuring charges also declined significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal million compared to million 
the fiscal restructuring charges consisted of million of employee severance for workforce reductions and million of facility consolidation charges 
the employee terminations affected both the broadband infrastructure and access segment and the professional services segment 
the million of restructuring charges in fiscal related to our actions to downsize our business in response to declining sales

substantially all of this goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
no businesses were acquired during fiscal or fiscal discontinued operations broadaccess during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to sell our broadaccess business  which was included in our broadband infrastructure and access segment

income taxes fiscal vs 
fiscal vs 
fiscal note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describes the items which have impacted our effective income tax rate for fiscal  and significant items include the deductibility of impairment charges and expiration of foreign tax credit carryovers 
in addition  as a result of our cumulative losses in fiscal and and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential  we concluded during the third quarter of fiscal that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
since the third quarter of fiscal  we have continued to provide a nearly full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information regarding the valuation allowance 
we recorded an income tax provision totaling million for fiscal primarily attributable to our foreign operations 
the income tax provision attributable to our us operations is minimal since the tax on this income is offset with the realization of deferred tax assets  which have a full valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit totaling million 
this benefit is primarily attributable to the reversal of accrued income tax liabilities resulting from the finalization of federal  state and foreign income tax examinations 
income loss from continuing operations income from continuing operations was million or per diluted share for fiscal  compared to loss from continuing operations of million or per diluted share for fiscal loss from continuing operations was million or per diluted share for fiscal segment disclosures broadband infrastructure and access segment detailed information regarding our broadband infrastructure and access segment is provided in the following table dollars in millions for the years ended october  operating income loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures at october  assets operating loss excludes certain charges and expenses not allocated to the segments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
during fiscal  operating income for the broadband infrastructure and access segment increased by to million compared to million in fiscal the inclusion of operating income by krone beginning on may   accounts for of the increase in operating income for fiscal the remaining increase in operating income for the broadband infrastructure and access segment resulted from increased connectivity sales which was attributable primarily to increased sales to our customers for products used in the core central office space and fiber to the x networks 
during fiscal  operating income for the broadband infrastructure and access segment was million  a million  or  increase over operating loss of million incurred during fiscal this improvement was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of our restructuring and impairment charges  the ongoing cost savings from our restructuring efforts and the divestiture of certain product lines 
while sales decreased  margins increased due to a shift in product sales mix to higher margin products 
we also benefited from production efficiencies and related production cost declines resulting from our decision to outsource portions of our manufacturing operations 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  and decreased million  or  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is attributable to our acquisition of krone 
the decrease in fiscal is the result of our restructuring efforts  which led to a reduction in our property  plant and equipment balances 
capital expenditures increased million  or  and decreased million  or  in fiscal and  respectively

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies because these policies are impacted significantly by estimates we make 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with current or committed inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods for previously sold equipment 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due primarily to adverse market conditions 
it is possible that significant increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
alternatively  if we are able to sell previously reserved inventory  we will find it necessary to reverse a portion of the reserves 
changes in inventory reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as of october  and  we had million and million  respectively  reserved against our inventories  which represents and  respectively  of total inventory on hand 
restructuring accrual during fiscal and  we recorded restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting leased facilities and employee severance costs 
prior to january   such charges were established in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
and recorded restructuring charges based on that standard 
restructuring charges represent our best estimate of our liability at the date the charges were taken 
significant judgment is required in estimating the costs of leased facilities 
for example  in estimating the restructuring costs for leased facilities  we make certain assumptions with respect to when a facility will be subleased and the amount of sublease income 
adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period they become known 
changes in assumptions could have a material effect on our restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
revenue from services consists of fees for systems requirements  system design and analysis  customization and installation services  ongoing system management  system enhancements and maintenance 
we primarily apply the percentage of completion method to these contracts for revenue recognition 
the assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether trade and notes receivable are reasonably assured of collection based on various factors  including an evaluation of whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers  which could result in us being unable to collect or sell the receivables 
in situations where it is unclear whether we will be able to sell or collect the receivable  revenue and related costs are deferred 
costs are recognized when it has been determined that the collection of the receivable is unlikely 
we record provisions against our gross revenue for estimated product returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo activities  current economic trends and changes in our customers demand 
should our actual product returns and allowances exceed our estimates  additional reductions to our revenue would result 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but are not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
significant increases may occur in the future due to deteriorating market conditions 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
changes in the allowance are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
as of october  and  we had million and million  respectively  reserved against our accounts receivable  which represents and  respectively  of total accounts receivable 
the decrease in allowance for uncollectible accounts from to is due to improved collections 
warranty we provide reserves for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we will be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
changes in warranty reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as of october  and  we reserved and million  respectively  related to future estimated warranty costs 
income taxes and deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets primarily in the united states as a result of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our income tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principles 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would not realize these assets 
our decision was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred to that point as well as the full utilization of our loss carryback potential 
from the third quarter of fiscal to date  we have maintained our policy of providing a nearly full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
we expect to continue to provide a nearly full allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
as of october   our net deferred tax assets were  million with a related valuation allowance of  million 
as of october   our net deferred tax assets were million with a related valuation allowance of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
litigation reserves as of october  and  we had recorded approximately million and million  in loss reserves for pending litigation 
this reserve was based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss is capable of reasonable estimation 
as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  and at part i  item of this form k legal proceedings  we are a party to numerous lawsuits  proceedings and claims 
litigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss or the amount thereof requires the exercise of considerable judgment  which is applied as of a certain date 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new matters  developments in existing matters or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to any particular matter 
pensions we acquired krone  which maintains a defined benefit pension for a portion of its german workforce 
a participating individual s post retirement pension benefit is based primarily on the individual s years of service and earnings 
the plan is accounted for in accordance with sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
that measurement includes estimates relating to the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liability could effectively be settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this discount rate  we considered rates of return on high grade fixed income investments with similar duration to the plan liability 
we used a discount rate of at october  a quarter percentage point increase decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which requires companies to consolidate certain types of variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is an entity that has inadequate invested equity at risk to meet expected future losses  or whose holders of the equity investments lack any of the following three characteristics i the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities  ii the obligation to absorb the entity s losses if they occur  or iii the right to receive the entity s future returns if they occur 
fin is applicable immediately for variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities created before february   the provisions of the interpretation are effective for financial statements issued for the first period ending after december   or march   depending on the nature of the variable interest entity 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
the provisions of the interpretation are effective for financial statements issued for periods that begin after june   which will be our fourth quarter beginning august  we will use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
compensation cost for awards granted prior to  but not vested as of the date sfas r is adopted would be based on the grant date  fair value and attributes originally used to value those awards 
we expect the adoption of this standard will reduce fourth quarter net income by approximately million 
this estimate is based on the number of options currently outstanding and exercisable and could change based on the number of options granted or forfeited in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash cash and cash equivalents  consisting primarily of short term money market instruments with maturities of three months or less  had a balance of million at october   which is a decrease of million compared to october  the major uses of cash during fiscal were million of acquisition costs primarily related to krone 
this use of cash was partially offset by million proceeds for the sale of singl 
eview product line 
as of october   we had restricted cash of million compared to million of restricted cash as of october   an increase of million 
our restricted cash increased due to the additions of krone balances and the statutory requirements related to a tender offer for a portion of a minority ownership interest 
restricted cash represents cash pledged to various financial institutions to secure certain of our obligations  and is not available to us for working capital 
the majority of our restricted cash represents collateral for letters of credit and lease obligations 
restricted cash is expected to become available to us upon satisfaction of the obligations pursuant to which the letters of credit or guarantees were issued 
we are entitled to the interest earnings on our restricted cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents were million as of october   which was an increase of million compared to october  the major sources of cash during fiscal were million in income tax refunds and the net proceeds of million from our convertible note offering completed on june  these cash inflows were partially offset by million of net property  plant and equipment additions 
finance related transactions on june   we issued million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes in two separate transactions pursuant to rule a under the securities act of this issuance was made through an initial offering of million of convertible notes on may   and the subsequent exercise in full by the underwriters of such offering of their option to purchase an additional million of convertible notes 
the net proceeds to us from this offering were million after underwriting discounts of million and the net payment for the purchased call options and warrant transactions described below 
in the first transaction  we issued million of fixed rate convertible unsecured subordinated notes that mature on june  in the second transaction  we issued million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes that have a variable interest rate and mature on june  the interest rate for the variable rate notes is equal to month libor plus 
the interest rate for the variable rate notes will be reset on each semi annual interest payment date  which are june and december of each year beginning on december   for both the fixed and variable rate notes 
the interest rate on the variable rate notes was and for the period s ending june and december   respectively 
the interest rate on the variable rate notes is for the current period ending june  the holders of both the fixed and variable rate notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of per share 
we may not redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity date 
we may redeem any or all of the variable rate notes at any time on or after june  concurrent with the issuance of the fixed and variable rate notes  we purchased five and ten year call options on our common stock to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes 
under the terms of these call options  which become exercisable upon conversion of the notes  we have the right to purchase from the counterparty at a purchase price of per share the aggregate number of shares that we are obligated to issue upon conversion of the fixed and variable rate notes  which is a maximum of million shares 
we also have the option to settle the call options with the counterparty through net a share settlement or cash settlements  either of which would be based on the extent to which the then current market price of our common stock exceeds per share 
the total cost of all the call options was million  which is recorded in shareowners investment 
the cost of the call options was partially offset by the sale of warrants to acquire shares of our common stock with terms of five and ten years to the same counterparty with whom we entered into the call options 
the warrants are exercisable for an aggregate of million shares at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants become exercisable upon conversion of the notes  and may be settled  at our option  either through a net share settlement or a net cash settlement  either of which would be based on the extent which the then current market price of our common stock exceeds per share 
the gross proceeds from the sale of the warrants were million  which was recognized in shareowners investment 
the call options and the warrants are subject to early expiration upon conversion of the notes 
the net effect of the call options and the warrants is to either reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes if we elect net share settlement or to increase the net cash proceeds of the offering if we elect net cash settlement if the notes are converted at a time when the current market price of our common stock is greater than per share 
we have used and plan to use the cash proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and strategic opportunities  including financing for possible acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
in connection with our issuance of the fixed rate and variable rate notes  we are required under a reg istration rights agreement to maintain an active registration statement with respect to the fixed and variable rate notes and the shares of our common stock that would be issued upon a conversion of those notes for a period of up to two years from the date the notes were issued 
we presently have an effective registration statement on form s with respect to these securities on file with the sec the registration statement 
because we were unable to timely file a current report on form k in august   we have lost our ability to rely on form s registration statements until august   and as a result  upon the filing of this report on form k  the registration statement will cease to be effective 
we intend to file a post effective amendment to the registration statement on a form s that post effective amendment on form s will need to be declared effective by the sec before it can be utilized 
under the terms of the registration rights agreement  if we fail to keep the registration statement effective  the interest rate on those notes that remain held by their initial holders will be increased by for days and thereafter will be increased by another 
this increase in the interest rate will remain in effect for so long as the registration statement remains ineffective and could last until as late as june  if the registration statement was to remain ineffective through june   the increase in the interest rate on the affected notes would result in additional interest payments of no more than approximately  we were party to an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters facility in eden prairie  minnesota 
this lease was set to expire in october of fiscal this operating lease  which is sometimes referred to as a synthetic lease  contained a minimum residual value guarantee at the end of the lease term  and also gave us a purchase option at the end of the lease term 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we purchased this property for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the entire purchase price was paid out of restricted cash 
in addition  during fiscal  we purchased a total of four other properties that we leased under synthetic leases 
two properties were purchased for million and the remaining two were purchased for million 
all of the properties were purchased using restricted cash previously pledged to secure the lease obligations 
the two properties that were purchased for million were recorded at their fair market value of million  which resulted in a million impairment charge and a million reduction in our restructuring accrual as we previously recognized this loss in a prior fiscal year 
these two properties were sold in fiscal the remaining two properties that were purchased for million were immediately sold for total proceeds of million  which was available to us as unrestricted cash 
the difference between the purchase price for these two properties of million and the sale price of million reduced our restructuring accrual 
vendor financing we have worked with customers and third party financiers to find a means of financing projects by negotiating financing arrangements 
as of october   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million and million for such arrangements  respectively 
the total amount drawn and outstanding under the commitments was approximately million  million and million  respectively  as of october   and the commitments to extend credit are conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates  conditions and purposes 
these commitments may expire without being drawn 
we regularly review all outstanding commitments  and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the overall risk for possible credit losses 
at october   we have recorded approximately million in loss reserves in the event of non performance related to these financing arrangements 
in connection with the sale of a participation interest in a customer note receivable for million  we guaranteed the payment obligation of the customer to the purchaser of the participation interest 
during fiscal  the underlying customer defaulted on the note receivable 
therefore  we were required to pay the purchaser of the participation interest million  which was the outstanding principal and interest on the note receivable at the time the customer defaulted 
of the million payment  we used million from our restricted cash that was previously pledged to secure our guarantee with the remainder being paid from unrestricted cash 
this note receivable was fully reserved for as part our allowance for doubtful accounts 
working capital and liquidity outlook our main source of liquidity continues to be our unrestricted cash on hand 
we believe that our current unrestricted cash on hand should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and restructuring costs through fiscal if we are able to maintain break even or positive cash flow from operations  our existing cash should be adequate to fund such expenditures for several years 
we believe that our entire restructuring accrual of million as of october   will have to be paid from our unrestricted cash shown as cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet as follows million for employee severance will be paid in fiscal  million for facilities consolidation costs  which relate principally to excess leased facilities  will be paid in fiscal  and the remainder of million  which also relates to excess leased facilities  will be paid over the respective lease terms ending through we also believe that our unrestricted cash on hand will also enable us to pursue strategic opportunities  including possible product line or business acquisitions 
however  if the cost of one or more acquisition opportunities exceeds our existing capital resources  additional sources of capital may be required 
we do not currently have any committed lines of credit or other available credit facilities  and it is uncertain whether such facilities could be obtained in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
any plan to raise additional capital may involve an equity based or equity linked financing  such as another issuance of convertible debt or the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or warrants to purchase stock  any of which would be dilutive to existing shareholders 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october   the following table summarizes our commitments in millions to make long term debt and lease payments and certain other contractual obligations 
payments due by period category total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum pension obligations total amounts represent non cancelable commitments to purchase goods and services  including items such as inventory and information technology support

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in security prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial condition adversely 
we  at times  reduce this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of issuing million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes on june   that have a variable interest rate 
the interest rate on these notes is equal to month libor plus 
the interest rate on these notes is reset semiannually on each interest payment date  which is june and december of each year until their maturity in fiscal the interest rate for the six month period ending december  was 
the interest rate on the variable rate notes is for the current six month period ending june  assuming interest rates rise an additional  and  our annual interest expense would increase by million  million and million  respectively 
we offer a non qualified k excess plan to allow certain executives to defer earnings in excess of the annual individual contribution and compensation limits on k plans imposed by the us internal revenue code 
under this plan  the salary deferrals and our matching contributions are not placed in a separate fund or trust account 
rather  the deferrals represent our unsecured general obligation to pay the balance owing to the executives upon termination of their employment 
in addition  the executives are able to elect to have their account balances indexed to a variety of diversified mutual funds stock  bond and balanced  as well as to our common stock 
accordingly  our outstanding deferred compensation obligation under this plan is subject to market risk 
as of october   our outstanding deferred compensation obligation related to the k excess plan was million  of which approximately million was indexed to adc common stock 
assuming a  or aggregate increase in the value of the investment alternatives to which the account balances may be indexed  our outstanding deferred compensation obligation would increase by million  million and million  respectively  and we would incur an expense of a like amount 
we also are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary risk is the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
our largest exposure comes from the e uro 
the result of a strengthening in the us dollar to our e uro denominated revenues and expenses would result in a decrease of operating income of million for the year ended october  we are also exposed to foreign currency exposure as a result of changes in intercompany balance sheet balances and other balance sheet items 
at october   we did not hedge any foreign currency exposures  however  from time to time we may implement certain risk management strategies that include the use of derivative instruments 
these strategies include the use of foreign currency forwards and options to hedge a portion of anticipated future sales denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro  british pound and australian dollar  in order to offset the effect of changes in exchange rates 
the use of foreign currency forwards and options to hedge certain foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables  primarily in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and canadian dollar  to offset the effect on earnings of changes in exchange rates until these receivables are collected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information about our foreign currency exchange hedging program
