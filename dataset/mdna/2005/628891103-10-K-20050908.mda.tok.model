page business overview our business is the supply of open end to end digital technology and services to digital pay television platform operators and content providers 
our technologies include conditional access and microprocessor security  broadcast stream management  set top box middleware  program guides epgs  personal video recording pvr technologies and interactive applications  which are supplied to pay television platform operators and their content providers 
we operate in a single market and manage our business as a single segment 
an analysis and discussion of our various revenue streams is provided in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a geographic analysis of the sources of our revenues for each of the last three fiscal years is given in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  as is information about the location of our long lived assets 
our business has grown through acquisition and through winning new contracts with customers 
in december  we acquired the mediahighway middleware business from thomson sa  which was previously part of the technology business of the french broadcaster canal the mediahighway acquisition 
this extended our presence in the middleware market as is explained below 
additionally  until august  we provided conditional access services  including the supply of smart cards to directv in the united states 
the contract with directv came to an end on august  in march  we signed a new six year contract with directv for conditional access services  and during fiscal we agreed to supply directv with middleware  interactive and pvr technologies 
during fiscal  three customers each accounted directly and indirectly for more than of our revenues 
these customers and the percentage of our fiscal revenues which they contributed were directv  bskyb and sky italia 
these customers  as well as some others  are businesses in which news corporation has an interest 
information about our business transactions with related parties is provided in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
our software systems and systems integration services are focused on providing platform operators and content providers with technology to help them profit from the secure distribution of digital information and entertainment  by allowing them to gain new subscribers  provide new services and gain new revenue streams  increase revenue per subscriber and use software systems to operate more efficiently 
we have identified three main categories of customers for our technologies and services the platform operator or broadcaster who typically operates the broadcast infrastructure 
the platform operator is a potential customer for all of our technologies and services 
we support many delivery methods  including satellite  cable  terrestrial  fixed telecom networks including broadband internet protocol television iptv and mobile telecom networks  the content provider or channel  who will purchase transmission capacity from the platform operator in order to broadcast its programs and information 
these content providers or channels are potential buyers of our interactive television infrastructure and applications 
while these customers do not comprise a separate business segment  we consider them to provide a complementary route to market for some of our technologies and services 
an application developed for a channel on one platform can be transferred to another platform and thereby provide the customer with some economies of scale  and set top box manufacturers and suppliers of other elements of the broadcast infrastructure with whom we work to integrate those aspects of our technologies which reside in devices supplied by them 
in some instances we receive payment from these customers  in other instances both parties work together for no immediate payment  but receive income as and when the device is sold 
viewers of a digital television service  who are customers subscribers of the platform operator or the content provider  are users of our technology but are not our customers because we have no direct commercial relationship with them 
we are committed to developing industry co operation by actively participating in over key standards bodies  consortia and working groups 
we use these forums proactively to promote open interfaces  which maximize interoperability and enable broadcasters and platform operators to meet the challenge of integrating broadcast  information and telecommunications technologies 
page our technology is integrated into set top boxes manufactured by most of the major consumer electronics manufacturers 
it is important for us and for platform operators that our technology be integrated into many different set top boxes  chips incorporated in set top boxes and other broadcast equipment 
this is because it provides platform operators and subscribers with greater choice and security of supply and because it aids price competition 
we compete in a number of business areas and no single company competes with us in all our product lines 
competition is intense and  in addition to price and commercial terms  we consider the key differentiators to be the level of security that our technology offers to a platform operator and our ability to maintain that security  the quality and ease of use of our systems  the availability of our other software elements  such as middleware  interactive software  epg and pvr  which allow a platform operator to provide additional services  the level of integration that exists between the various elements of our technologies  the availability of set top boxes offered by manufacturers with whom our technology is integrated  the availability and cost of chips incorporated into our smart cards  the complexity of the broadcast system requirements and the degree of adaptation and integration required  the degree of our compliance with the various international  national and regional standards that relate to broadcast technology  the ability of our conditional access technology to work alongside that of a competitor s in a process known as simulcrypt  which allows a platform operator to replace one conditional access system with another in a controlled manner without disabling a legacy population of set top boxes  and the ability to integrate our technology with broadcast equipment and related systems 
our sales teams operate in the united kingdom  europe and the middle east  the united states  latin america and the asia pacific region 
they are supported by regional marketing activity designed to promote awareness of our company and our technologies and services in each region 
we may bid jointly for projects to implement a new platform with broadcast equipment manufacturers  system integrators and consumer electronics manufacturers 
we offer technologies and services in the following main areas conditional access systems and services  content protection  middleware  pvr technologies  broadband and iptv  interactive television infrastructure and applications  and integration services 
the technologies deployed at the platform operator s facilities head end and in the consumer device are tightly integrated and are an essential component of a digital pay television network and the channels and other content carried 
our customers may purchase technologies and services from us in one or more of these main areas 
these technologies and services comprise a single business segment from which we derive a number of different revenue streams 
a discussion of these revenue streams and a quantitative commentary on our business is given under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our main technology solutions and services are discussed in more detail below 
page conditional access conditional access systems are an essential component of a pay television platform 
conditional access systems enable our customers to manage and control the secure distribution of entertainment and information  whether distributed by broadcast or broadband media including cable  satellite  terrestrial  telephone network  the internet  etc conditional access provides two primary functions 
firstly  it protects content from unauthorized viewing  redistribution and piracy  and secondly it enables our customers to charge subscribers for a selected content package or event 
our conditional access systems are sold under the name videoguard 
the videoguard family of systems is compatible with all internationally accepted digital television transmission standards 
videoguard conditional access systems include software components that are installed on dedicated server systems at the platform operator s head end and which are responsible for interfacing with the platform operator s subscriber management system  back office and billing systems and play out and transmission management systems  technologies that are integrated in the set top box and which  if authorized  permit the decryption of content and which also support various functions essential to the epg  pvr functionality  secure return path communication and interactive applications  and a removable smart card which is inserted into each set top box and contains an embedded computer chip that  if authorized  generates code words used by the set top box to decrypt and display the relevant content 
the smart card is manufactured under strict security conditions by third party manufacturers  based on proprietary designs provided by us 
all of our smart cards are tested  programmed and dispatched from one of our two facilities  one in the united kingdom and one in the united states  which together are capable of processing up to million cards per year 
in fiscal  we distributed approximately million smart cards 
we maintain a pro active security policy by implementing  when necessary  electronic over the air countermeasures altering authorized smart cards in a manner which then renders counterfeit smart cards obsolete 
we also provide our customers with periodic replacement smart cards changeover cards which enable new features and up to date technology to be introduced 
our smart cards are customized to meet each of our customers requirements 
as of june   approximately million set top boxes were in use with videoguard conditional access technology 
our largest conditional access customers and their region of operation include directv us  bskyb uk  sky italia italy  directv panamericana latin america  sky mexico mexico  sky brasil brazil  foxtel australia  skylife korea  yes israel  hot israel  cablevision us and viasat scandinavia 
we consider our main conditional access competitors to be nagravision developed by kudelski sa  digicypher developed by motorola  inc and power key developed by scientific atlanta  inc 
content protection consumers are increasingly expecting more flexibility as to the place and time they view digital content 
a key issue for content owners and distributors is that once the digital content is moved to an unprotected environment outside their control it can be copied  re distributed and viewed in its original quality  illegally or without the content owners ability to generate revenues from such use 
our secure video processor svp technology addresses this issue by providing a rights management standard scheme using hardware based security such that content may be transferred to an authorized device which has an svp chip in it 
the svp chip is created by incorporating svp technologies into an existing video processor chip which can then be integrated into a consumer electronics device  such as a digital television  set top box  personal video recorder  dvd or mp player  mobile phone and other portable devices 
an svp enabled chip controls both the content and the license to use that content 
we are promoting svp as an open standard  available to all and any chipset manufacturer  consumer electronics manufacturer and broadcast platform operator on reasonable and non discriminatory terms to ensure that the distribution of content to home networks and consumer devices can be achieved securely and at low cost  while supporting the needs and reasonable expectations of consumers 
we established svp alliance  a group of interested parties who are working to promote the widespread use of svp for the secure distribution of digital entertainment content 
page our technologies and systems for mobile digital rights management drm solutions are sold under the mvideoguard name 
mvideoguard is aimed at assisting companies who wish to distribute valuable content to mobile phones in protecting the content revenues from threats of piracy and providing flexible business models that raise revenues and increase network traffic 
our solutions are compliant with the oma drm technology standard and support multiple delivery mechanisms  including downloading  streaming  unicasting  multicasting  broadcasting  secure billing and payments 
numerous companies are developing content protection technologies that will compete with ours 
middleware middleware is similar to operating system software  but is integrated in digital television set top boxes 
the combination of our conditional access technologies and set top box middleware enables applications to be run on the set top box in a standard  user friendly  controlled and secure manner 
this allows our customers to enhance their subscribers experience by providing a user friendly  always on  fast audio and video environment capable of supplying epgs  shopping  e mail  games  banking  advertising and other interactive services 
we provide a full range of middleware solutions  which include mediahighway core an easily upgradeable middleware solution that allows platform operators to deploy a wide range of services  including epgs  interactive applications and pvrs  quickly and cost effectively on low cost set top boxes  mediahighway advanced a multi tasking middleware solution that runs on fully featured set top boxes 
the architecture and features of mediahighway advanced support complex systems such as home networking with broadband access 
mediahighway advanced complies with the major television and internet open standards  including dvb mhp  html  ocap and javascript 
as of june   we estimate that a cumulative million set top boxes containing mediahighway have been shipped  an increase of million since june  mediahighway is being used by the following customers canalsatellite france  canal digital scandinavia  sky mexico mexico  sky brasil brazil  astro measat malaysia and yes israel 
during fiscal  we worked on the development of middleware for directv 
the download of our middleware to directv set top boxes started successfully in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  our revenue recognition criteria were not met as of june  we expect to recognize revenue from this during fiscal and beyond 
our main competitor in middleware is opentv corp 
pvr we have developed a pvr technology called xtv which extends the television viewing experience by integrating mass storage devices  such as hard drives  in set top boxes 
the xtv enabled set top boxes and head end systems are tightly integrated with our conditional access technologies  ensuring that the content in the subscriber s set top box is stored in encrypted form so that viewing  copying or distribution can be controlled by the platform operator or content owner 
xtv uses meta data data about data embedded in the broadcast stream to provide services and functionality that are not readily available in other products that focus only in managing the hard disk that is integrated in the set top box or digital television 
we do not manufacture or market the set top box which forms the basis of the pvr  but we license our technology to platform operators and consumer electronics manufacturers who supply the markets in which our platform operator customers operate 
our xtv technology has been deployed by the following customers bskyb united kingdom  foxtel australia  natsat brazil  sky mexico mexico  yes israel and hot israel 
because of the way in which our xtv is tightly integrated with our conditional access technologies  we do not consider other pvr products to be direct competitors 
broadband and iptv our technologies and systems for broadband and iptv are sold under the synamedia name 
synamedia incorporates our technologies for personalization  meta data synchronization and management  content protection and rights management 
it provides a broadband platform operator with the ability to offer television services  such as video on demand vod  multi cast television  video streaming  content guides  interactive applications  secure commerce and pvr type functionality 
page based on our videoguard security  synamedia protects content at all stages of delivery  from the broadband access point through to the set top box in the home 
once content is received inside the home  videoguard protects the valuable digital content from piracy  whether it is stored locally or routed through a home network 
videoguard uses content encryption and a secure key management system that allows iptv set top boxes to be used for viewing content on a television screen 
synamedia therefore ensures content protection and revenues for telecommunications companies wanting to introduce new video and television services  content providers and broadband broadcasters considering iptv broadcasting and vod services  cable television companies considering phone networks or fiber to the home as an alternative to digital cable  and satellite or terrestrial broadcasters considering vod over iptv to complement their traditional broadcast business 
among our synamedia customers are bb cable softbank japan  cyta cyprus  sistema russia  viasat scandinavia and galaxy hong kong 
numerous companies offer competing technologies in the area of broadband and iptv  including telecommunications companies and businesses which supply software to the personal computer market 
interactive television infrastructure and applications our value tv solution simplifies the business of interactive television for television platform operators  content providers and advertisers by offering a suite of tools supporting the creation  packaging  delivery and management of interactive content and applications  as well as a suite of standardized applications that can be licensed by  or customized for  a particular application 
these applications include epg  games and gaming which are sold under the visionik games and orbis brand names  voting  sports applications  news  commerce  interactive advertising and other enhanced television applications 
apart from these standardized applications  we also develop stand alone applications for platform operators and content providers 
among our value tv customers are the following platform operators bskyb uk  directv usa  directv panamericana latin america  sky mexico mexico  sky brasil brazil  sky italia italy  viasat scandinavia  foxtel australia  yes israel and hot israel 
we also supply technology and applications to numerous channels and content providers operating on these platforms 
our openbet software is used by licensed bookmakers and gaming organizations as a platform for internet and television based bookmaking and gaming operations 
although such bookmaking and gaming operations are highly restricted in the united states  their use is permitted in several jurisdictions  including the united kingdom 
openbet allows a single operator to create multiple betting sites eg  retail locations  internet  television all powered by the same openbet server 
it has two main elements the openbet gambling engine and the openbet game framework 
the openbet gambling engine is the core of the system 
it contains all the central features required by any gambling site  including customer accounts  registration and identity validation  electronic payment  event management  liability management and monitoring  multi currency and multi lingual functions  regulatory compliance  administration and reports 
the openbet game framework allows operators to develop their own games 
different types of games can be hosted by the openbet game framework  such as sports betting  casino games  lottery games and fantasy competitions 
we are expanding the openbet product group to include our own casino type games and person to person betting 
openbet is used by many of the major bookmakers in the united kingdom and some companies in the asia pacific region 
openbet is used by several bookmakers and gaming companies that operate specialist channels or applications on the bskyb platform 
we only sell openbet to companies that operate in tightly regulated markets and which take steps including the use of specific functionality of openbet to ensure that bets are not accepted from persons in jurisdictions where such activities may not be legal 
this policy limits the potential market for openbet 
integration and support services we complement our technologies with a wide range of services  including consulting  broadcast system design and integration  support and maintenance and  in some cases  on site operation and management of systems we have supplied to our customers 
our experience in implementing large and complex systems has enabled us to sell services to assist companies in planning and designing new platforms 
system integration involves both the selection of appropriate vendors and the integration of various components  including those of third party manufacturers  into a single operational broadcast system 
in some cases we may act as prime integrator and subcontract aspects of the work to third parties 
in other cases we may be a subcontractor to a third party prime integrator 
once our customers systems are operational  we offer them after sale services including ongoing support and maintenance 
we also offer consulting services  including business consulting  technical assistance  and security design for interactive and other advanced services 
page intellectual property our technology is critical to our success 
we need to protect our intellectual property rights  both in our proprietary technology and in technology which is licensed to us 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  licenses  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we generally enter into confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our employees  customers and suppliers 
we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of various patents  patent applications and patentable inventions from yeda research development company limited yeda in israel in the area of digital identification and signature schemes  which have been invented by professor adi shamir 
we pay a royalty to yeda based on a percentage of relevant revenues arising from our videoguard conditional access technologies 
we have a worldwide non exclusive license to use certain patents owned by thomson sa which support our mediahighway middleware technologies 
we are also a non exclusive licensee of intellectual property rights owned by various third parties 
these rights have been acquired by the payment of a fixed sum or royalty 
we work on the development of high security encryption algorithms 
these are mathematical procedures implemented in software that are used to accomplish a specific function  such as encrypting or decrypting data  messages or video signals by means of secret keys and code words 
our security research team has developed a number of proprietary high security encryption algorithms used in our conditional access systems 
our chip design team has developed a number of proprietary improvements to the security and functionality of chips that we integrate into our smart cards 
such improvements include  for example  functions that hinder the unauthorized duplication of our smart cards or the use of counterfeit smart cards in a set top box 
we have developed a number of techniques that allow us to send specially disguised and encoded messages that disable or alter the operating characteristics of our smart cards 
these technologies allow our customers to disable the smart cards of delinquent subscribers 
in addition  they allow our customers to combat signal theft more effectively by altering the operating characteristics of all valid smart cards in a way which makes counterfeit smart cards incompatible with the signals transmitted by our customers 
we have developed sophisticated protocols for transmitting authorization  entitlement and other control messages to smart cards 
these protocols allow control messages to be compressed in a way which consumes only a small fraction of the broadcaster s bandwidth  allowing the broadcaster to transmit more programs and channels to its subscribers without having to compromise its ability to control each individual subscriber s viewing entitlements 
research and development our total expenditure on research and development in the three fiscal years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
this includes the cost of research into new technologies which may be of future benefit to us and our customers  the cost of developing prototype applications for demonstration to customers and potential customers  and the costs of adapting and integrating applications and new technologies to meet a particular customer s requirements 
the largest research and development projects have been on set top box software  particularly the development of advanced middleware  program guide and pvr technologies and the development of games and gaming applications 
regulation we are not an operator of conditional access systems 
however  our technology is used by broadcasters and operators of conditional access systems 
our customers may therefore be subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they offer their services 
these regulations  which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and future changes or additions to such regulations  may affect our ability to sell our conditional access technologies and services 
we do not operate as a bookmaker 
however  our openbet software is a betting and gaming application 
our customers are therefore subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they offer their services 
this may involve the independent certification of our software 
in many jurisdictions  betting and gaming regulations are being reviewed  specifically to address betting and gaming on the internet and television 
it is possible that our customers will become subject to new regulations in this area 
the current regulations  which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and any future changes in such regulations  may affect our ability to sell our technologies and services related to betting and gaming 
page raw materials we do not manufacture smart cards  but our engineers design the computer chips which are embedded in our smart cards 
we arrange for the chips to be manufactured and assembled by third party suppliers 
we then program the smart cards with our proprietary software 
smart card costs are dependent upon the costs of raw materials  including the cost of computer chips  plastic and assembly  and the quantity of smart cards purchased and processed in any period 
we purchase the chips which are contained within our smart cards from third party manufacturers 
there are very few companies with the manufacturing skills and capacity to supply our requirements for smart card chips  especially given the sophistication of our designs 
additionally  we often use a single manufacturer for a particular generation of smart card for a particular customer 
accordingly  any disruption to supply or lack of availability of manufacturing capacity at our chip suppliers could harm our ability to deliver smart cards to our customers or could negatively affect our operating margins 
order backlog we do not consider it meaningful to quantify order backlog 
our customer contracts are typically long term arrangements for the supply of smart cards  security and other services  initial systems  subsequent system enhancements and other aspects of our technologies 
seasonality our business is not seasonal 
however  demand for smart cards can be influenced by the consumer marketing activities of our broadcast platform customers and the timing of delivery of technology enhancements can also be influenced by such activities 
risk factors prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the company s securities 
our business will suffer if we do not respond to commercial and technological changes affecting the broadcasting industry 
our business and the market in which we operate is characterized by rapid commercial and technological change  evolving industry standards and frequent product enhancements 
many digital broadcasters are seeking more sophisticated software which will afford them greater flexibility in delivering content such as news  films and sports 
they are also seeking to offer additional services such as middleware  epgs  games  gaming and other interactive applications  pvr functionality  home networks services and other services 
our continued success will depend  in part  upon our ability to develop and market products and services that respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards in a timely and cost effective manner 
if the market in which we operate develops more slowly than we anticipate  or if we should fail to develop and introduce products and services that are compatible with industry standards  satisfy customer requirements and compete effectively with products and services offered by our competitors  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results and growth could decline if our customers subscriber bases do not continue to increase 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of smart cards and new technologies to our customers and ongoing subscriber fees paid by our customers on a monthly basis based on the number of active subscribers or authorized smart cards 
we also receive royalties based on each set top box manufactured or deployed which incorporates our technology 
therefore a significant portion of our revenues is dependent upon our customers subscriber numbers  the growth in those numbers  the degree to which set top boxes are replaced with enhanced models and the number of set top boxes in each subscriber s home 
if our customers subscriber numbers do not continue to increase  we may be unable to generate substantial revenue growth or sustain our current revenue levels and as a consequence our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
page our business could be harmed if the security provided by our conditional access systems and products is compromised 
we face risks relating to the failure of our conditional access systems to protect platform operators and content providers from signal theft 
an important component of our conditional access systems is the smart cards we provide for the platform operators individual subscribers 
unauthorized viewing and use of content may be accomplished by counterfeiting the smart card or otherwise thwarting its security features 
any significant increase in the incidence of signal theft could require the replacement of a platform operator s smart cards sooner than otherwise planned 
in those cases where we have accepted specific responsibilities for maintaining the security of a platform operator s conditional access system  significant costs could be imposed on us if a security breach requires an accelerated replacement of smart cards 
to the extent that signal theft may result in the cessation of all  or some portion of  the per subscriber fees paid to us by a broadcaster while the security breach is being remedied or  in the event of termination by the broadcaster of our agreement if the breach is not satisfactorily remedied  the resultant loss of revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
a significant increase in the level of signal theft  whether or not resulting from a failure of our conditional access systems  could also injure the reputation of our conditional access systems among our customers and potential customers and as a consequence  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
a substantial part of our expected future revenue and income growth is based on our aim to sell advanced technologies and services to our existing customers and to sell end to end systems to new customers 
we expect over the next several years to sell advanced technology solutions for the television market  including middleware  epgs  games  gaming and other interactive applications  pvr functionality  home networks services and other services 
the market for advanced television technology solutions is still new and evolving 
historically  we have derived only a relatively small percentage of our total revenue from these offerings 
we cannot be certain that the demand for or the market acceptance of these technologies will develop as we anticipate  and even if they do  we cannot be certain that we will be able to market these solutions effectively and successfully respond to changes in consumer preferences 
in addition  our ability to market those solutions will be affected to a large degree by platform operators 
if platform operators determine that our solutions do not meet their business or operational expectations  they may choose not to offer our applications to their customers 
to the extent that platform operators and content providers fail to renew or enter into new or expanded contracts with us for provision of advanced technologies  we will be unable to maintain or increase the associated revenue from those offerings 
moreover  due to global economic conditions  platform operators may slow the pace of their deployment of these advanced services and such action would negatively impact our revenues 
accordingly  our ability to generate substantial revenues from our advanced technology solutions offerings is uncertain 
our business could be harmed if a defect in our software or technology interferes with  or causes any failure in  our customers systems 
our software and technology are integrated into the broadcast infrastructure of our customers 
accordingly  a defect  error or performance problem with our software or technology could interfere with  or cause a critical component of  one or more of our customers systems to fail for a period of time 
this could result in claims for substantial damages against us  regardless of whether we are responsible for such failure 
any claim brought against us could be expensive to defend and require the expenditure of a significant amount of resources  regardless of whether we prevail 
although we have not experienced any such material interference or failure in the past  any future problem could cause severe customer service and public relations problems for our customers and as a consequence  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend upon key personnel  including our senior executives and technical and engineering staff  to operate our business effectively  and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel 
our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our senior executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
if certain of our senior executives were to leave the company  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  we may also need to increase the number of our technical  consulting and support employees to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers 
we have  in the past  experienced difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of qualified personnel 
if we are not successful in these recruiting efforts  our business may be adversely affected 
intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
we compete with numerous companies both to attract new customers and to retain our existing customers 
such competition may cause us to lose market share and may result in reduced profit margins 
it may also hinder our ability to develop our business in areas such as pvrs  middleware  interactive television services and iptv 
in addition  some of the companies that currently operate in the software business  but which have not historically been active competitors of ours may  in the future  through acquisitions or the development of their own resources  seek to enter and obtain significant market share in our current or planned business areas 
increased competition from existing or new competitors could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
page we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers 
our revenues could decline significantly if any of these customers significantly reduces its purchases of our technology or services  or terminates its relationship with us 
our growth has depended historically on large digital satellite broadcasters introducing  marketing and promoting products and services that utilize our technology 
we currently derive  and we expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers 
our three largest customers have been directv in the united states  bskyb in the united kingdom and sky italia in italy 
in fiscal  these three customers accounted directly and indirectly for approximately of our total revenues 
we expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues  although the particular customers may vary from period to period 
if a large customer purchases significantly less of our products or services  defers or cancels orders  or terminates its relationship with us  our revenues could decline significantly and as a result  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the adoption of industry wide standards for interactive television could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or place downward pressure on our pricing 
ongoing efforts to establish industry wide standards for interactive television software include a commitment by cable network operators in the united states to deploy a uniform platform for interactive television based on a jointly developed specification known as the opencable applications platform and an initiative by european television industry participants to create a similar platform called multimedia home platform 
the establishment of these standards or other similar standards could adversely affect the pricing of our products and services  significantly reduce the value of our intellectual property and the competitive advantage our proprietary technology provides  cause us to incur substantial expenditures to adapt our products or services to respond to these developments or otherwise harm our business  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
we are not currently a member of cablelabs  the research and development consortium managing the opencable initiative  or certain other standards setting organizations 
while we are involved in the activity of cablelabs and while we continually assess our position with respect to any relevant standards setting organizations  and have joined several of them  our failure to participate in certain organizations may affect the willingness of their respective members to conduct business with us and this may adversely affect our ability to sell products or services cable network operators or other potential customers that are members of those organizations 
if that were to be the case  our ability to continue to grow our business might be adversely affected 
the nature of our business is such that our operating results may fluctuate from period to period 
our operating results have varied in the past from quarter to quarter and from year to year and are likely to vary from period to period in the future 
historically  our revenues have reflected a small number of relatively large orders for our technology and services  which generally have long sales and order cycles 
additionally  our customers replace their subscribers smart cards from time to time  either to upgrade the features of the smart cards or for security purposes 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
our actual results may differ from analyst expectations  which could adversely affect the price of our securities 
changes to current accounting policies or in how such policies are interpreted or applied to our business could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
new accounting pronouncements or a change in how us gaap is interpreted or applied to our business could have a significant effect on our reported results 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may in the future be affected by changes in the accounting rules include revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation and accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
our revenue recognition policy  in particular  is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine what portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
because different contracts may require different accounting treatment  it may be difficult for investors to properly assess our financial condition or operating results unless they carefully review all of our financial information  including our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
page failure to protect the intellectual property rights upon which we depend could harm our business 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  trademark and copyright laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and the obligations we have to third parties from whom we license intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
defending against intellectual property infringement claims could harm our business 
we may be subject to an increased risk of infringement claims as the number of products and competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
it may be alleged that products that we have developed or technology that we have licensed from third parties infringes the rights of others 
intellectual property claims could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause product shipment delays 
such claims could also require us to seek to enter into royalty or license agreements  redesign our products or potentially cease using aspects of technology  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we grant certain indemnification rights to our customers when we license our software technologies 
we may  therefore  become subject to third party infringement claims through those commercial arrangements 
in addition  the damages to which we are subject may be increased by the use of our technologies in our customers products 
many of our agreements with customers contain an indemnification obligation  which could be triggered in the event that a customer is named in an infringement suit involving their products or involving the customer s products or services that incorporate or use our products 
if it is determined that our products infringe any of the asserted claims in such a suit  we may be prevented from distributing certain of our products and we may incur significant indemnification liabilities  which may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  while damage claims in respect of an alleged infringement may  in many cases  be based upon a presumed royalty rate that the patent holder would have otherwise been entitled to  it is possible that our liability may increase as a result of the incorporation of our technology with our customer s products 
in some cases  potential damages against us could be based on the profits derived from a product that infringes through the use of our software even though we receive a relatively moderate economic benefit from the licensing arrangement 
any significant disruption in our processing of smart cards could adversely affect our business 
we process all of our smart cards at two facilities  one located in england and the other in california 
a significant disruption in the processing of smart cards at either facility could result in delays in the delivery of smart cards to our customers 
the sale of smart cards which we have processed is a material portion of our business 
although our smart card processing facilities are designed to provide sufficient capacity to meet expected demand if one facility becomes inoperable for a limited period of time  any significant disruption to our smart card processing facilities could result in the loss of revenues  customers and future sales 
we may be unable to process sufficient quantities of smart cards because we obtain certain components from  and depend upon  a limited number of suppliers 
we currently obtain the chips used in our smart cards from a limited number of suppliers 
in the event of a disruption of supply  including a shortage of manufacturing capacity  we may be unable to develop an alternative source in a timely manner or at favorable prices 
such failure could harm our ability to deliver smart cards to our customers or could negatively affect our operating margins 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
political  regulatory and economic risks associated with our international customers could harm our business 
our customers are located throughout the world 
inherent risks of doing business in international markets include changes in legal and regulatory requirements  export restrictions  exchange controls  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer payment cycles  political disruption  wars  acts of terrorism and civil unrest 
we may incur substantial expense as a result of the imposition of new restrictions or changes in the existing legal and regulatory environments in the territories where we conduct our business or due to political and economic instability in these territories 
the telecommunications  media  broadcast and cable television industries are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies continue to oversee and adopt legislation and regulation over these industries  particularly in the areas of user privacy  consumer protection  online content distribution and the characteristics and quality of online products and services  which may affect our business  the development of our products  the decisions by market participants to adopt our products and services or the acceptance of interactive television by the marketplace in general 
in particular  governmental laws or regulations restricting or burdening the exchange of personally identifiable information could delay the implementation of interactive services or create liability for us or any other manufacturer of software that facilitates information exchange 
these governmental agencies may also seek to regulate interactive television directly 
future developments relating to any of these regulatory matters may adversely affect our business 
page fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could harm our financial condition 
a risk inherent in our international operations is the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
certain of our customer contracts denominate prices in pounds sterling or in euros 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were denominated in pounds sterling and a further were denominated in euros 
some of our smart card costs and our operating expenses are denominated in pounds sterling and euros 
in fiscal  we estimate that approximately of our total cost of sales and operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or in euros 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  although most of our contracts with customers in latin america and the asia pacific region are denominated in us dollars  those customers are affected by fluctuations in their local currencies and by exchange control regulations which may restrict their ability to remit payments to us 
we are subject to certain risks relating to our operations in israel 
we have research and development facilities in israel and we have customers in israel 
we are therefore directly influenced by the political  economic and security conditions affecting israel 
any major hostilities involving israel  or the interruption or curtailment of trade or the movement of people within israel or between israel and other countries  could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  certain of our employees are currently required to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli defense force and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
we have  in the past  operated effectively under these requirements 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on us in the future 
we are controlled by  and are dependent upon our relationship with  news corporation 
we are controlled by news corporation 
as of the date hereof  news corporation beneficially owns approximately of our total issued and outstanding share capital 
because news corporation beneficially owns of our series b ordinary shares  which have ten votes per share as opposed to our series a ordinary shares which have one vote per share  it controls approximately of our voting power 
by reason of such ownership  news corporation is able to control the composition of our entire board of directors and to control the votes on all other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders 
three of our seven current directors are directors of news corporation 
additionally  dr 
abe peled  our president and chief executive officer  is a member of news corporation s executive management committee and from time to time is involved in matters pertaining to news corporation s wider business interests 
businesses in which news corporation has an interest currently account for  and are expected to continue to account for  a significant portion of our revenues 
during fiscal  approximately of our total revenues were derived directly from businesses in which news corporation has an interest 
those businesses include our three largest customers 
although we believe the terms of our contracts with such related parties are no less favorable to us than those that we could obtain from unrelated third parties  we cannot assure you that this is the case 
in addition  because a number of major broadcasters around the world are owned or controlled by entities that compete with news corporation or entities in which news corporation has an interest  our ability to attract customers in which news corporation does not have an interest may be affected by their perception of our relationship with news corporation 
because we are controlled by news corporation  we are exempt from certain listing requirements of the nasdaq national market relating to corporate governance matters 
over the past several years  the national association of securities dealers has adopted certain listing requirements for companies listed on the nasdaq national market 
as a result of news corporation s beneficial ownership of our series b ordinary shares  we are deemed to be a controlled company and accordingly are not subject to some of these requirements  including the requirement that a majority of our board of directors be independent under the guidelines established by the national association of securities dealers and certain requirements regarding the determination of our chief executive officer s compensation and our director nominees 
while we do not believe that our exemption from those requirements affects the manner and method by which we manage and operate the company  investors should be aware that we are not subject to those provisions and may have no obligation to comply with those requirements in the future unless our ownership profile changes 
page since we are a public limited company organized under the laws of england and wales  your rights as a shareholder differ from the rights of shareholders under us law 
nds group plc is a public limited company organized under the laws of england and wales 
the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and  indirectly  many of the rights of holders of our american depositary shares adss are governed by english law and by our memorandum and articles of association 
these rights differ from the rights of shareholders in us companies 
in particular  english law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of english companies may bring derivative actions 
under english law generally  only the company can be the proper plaintiff in proceedings in respect of wrongful acts committed against us 
in addition  it may be difficult for you to enforce liabilities predicated upon us securities laws 
our share price could be affected by our ordinary shares becoming available for sale in the future or by the dilutive effect of the issue of new shares 
if investors or news corporation sell substantial amounts of our adss or ordinary shares in the public market  the market price of our adss could fall 
the negative effect of such sales on the market price of our adss could be more pronounced given the relatively small number of our ordinary shares in ads form relative to the total number of shares outstanding 
in addition  such sales could create the public perception of difficulties or problems with our technologies and services 
these sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate if we require additional financing 
interests of existing shareholders may also be diluted due to the existence of stock options granted to certain employees 
we may grant further stock options to our directors  executive officers and employees
