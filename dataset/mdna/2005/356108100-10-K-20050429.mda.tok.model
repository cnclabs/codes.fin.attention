as we expand our chain and build the infrastructure necessary to support our planned growth  we also have placed continued focus on refining our store prototype and initiated programs to enhance the profitability of the selling space in our stores 
restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  a number of companies within the retail industry have announced adjustments to their financial statements related to lease accounting issues 
after discussions with its audit committee and its current and previous independent registered public accounting firms  the company has re evaluated its lease accounting practices 
like many other retail companies  the company is correcting the way it accounts for leases  specifically the accounting for the amortization periods related to leasehold improvements  the accounting for contingent lease payments  and the straight line accounting of lease payments 
previously the company had amortized its leasehold improvements over the estimated life of the asset 
management determined that the appropriate interpretation of the lease term under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  sfas provides for an amortization period no longer than the sum of the fixed noncancellable term and any options where  at the inception of the lease  renewal is reasonably assured 
management determined that renewal of the majority of lease terms  associated with leasehold improvements whose useful lives included the option period  were not reasonably assured under paragraph of sfas for locations where the amortization period of leasehold improvements exceeded the corresponding lease term and any reasonably assured renewal  the company shortened the amortization of the leasehold improvements to coincide with the end of the lease term as defined by sfas management determined that renewal was reasonably assured for lease terms following a current term in which significant leasehold improvements were made 
these significant leasehold improvements were amortized through the following renewal period but not in excess of months 
the correction required the company to adjust accumulated amortization of leasehold improvements and retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets and to record additional amortization of leasehold improvement expense in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
the company had historically recorded contingent rent in the year in which the amounts were paid 
management analyzed financial accounting standards  eitf  accounting for contingent rent  and determined that the company should accrue payments which are probable for future contingent rents in the period they become probable 
the correction required the company to record additional deferred rent in current accrued expenses and to adjust retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as restate rent expense in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
finally  the company had historically recognized rent holiday periods on a straight line basis over the original lease term commencing on the date of possession 
during the evaluation it was noted  however  that there were additional leases with rent holidays that had not been accounted for on a straight line basis 
leases not accounted for on this basis were corrected to properly recognize rent holiday periods 
management re evaluated financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  and determined that  consistent with the letter issued by the office of the chief accountant  the lease term should include lease renewal options for which the company would be penalized for non renewal 
the company determined that the term penalty under paragraph f of sfas for non renewal includes factors such as the addition of significant leasehold improvements which would be forfeited if a lease term were not renewed 
the majority of the leases entered into by the company do not include a penalty for which the renewal would be reasonably assured 
the correction required the company to record additional deferred rent in other accrued expenses and other long term liabilities and to adjust retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as to restate rent expense in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
the cumulative effect of these corrections is a reduction to retained earnings of million net of taxes of million as of the beginning of fiscal and reductions to retained earnings of million net of taxes of million and million net of taxes of million as of january and  respectively 
these adjustments did not have any impact on the overall cash flows of the company 
public company accounting oversight board pcaob auditing standard no 
identifies a number of circumstances that  because of their likely significant negative effect on internal control over financial reporting  are to be regarded as strong indicators that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting exists  including the restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of a misstatement 
management has evaluated the impact of the aforementioned restatement on the company s assessment of its system of internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted in the incorrect lease accounting represented a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of this restatement on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of january   as well as the company s consolidated statement of income and cash flows for fiscal and the impact on previously reported quarterly results is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to these corrections 
critical accounting policies the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements and the most critical accounting policies are as follows inventories 
warehouse inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the fifo first in  first out method 
retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate cost figures 
based upon our historical information we have not experienced any significant change in our cost valuation for the years and management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which are  and  at january  and january   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost are maintained using the rim method  then adjusted by application of the producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by  at january  and  at january  the lifo reserve increased by   and  during   and  respectively 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement  whichever is lesser 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company changed the estimated lives of certain store fixtures from five to ten years 
based on the company s historical experience  ten years is a closer approximation of the actual lives of these assets 
the change in estimate is applied prospectively 
expenses for the fourth quarter of were favorably impacted by approximately million 
per diluted share 
as a result of this change 
the company expects this change in estimate to have a positive effect on earnings across all four quarters of vendor rebates 
the company receives vendor rebates for achieving certain purchase or sales volume and receives vendor allowances to fund certain expenses 
the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf is effective for arrangements with vendors initiated on or after january  eitf addresses the accounting and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor s products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor s products 
the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold  unless specific criteria are met qualifying the consideration for treatment as reimbursement of specific  identifiable incremental costs 
the provisions of this consensus have been applied prospectively 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements as a whole 
for vendor funding arrangements that were entered into prior to december  and have not been modified subsequently  the company recognizes a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses or cost of goods sold when earned 
if these arrangements are modified in the future  the provisions of eitf will apply and the effect may be material to the financial statements as a whole 
one such arrangement is the company s contract with our primary pharmaceutical wholesaler amerisourcebergen corporation bergen  which presently expires in should the company elect to renew the contract with bergen prior to its expiration date  there could be a material impact on the company s financial statements as a whole  because rebates subsequent to the renewal would initially reduce inventory carrying values 
insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on known claims and estimates for future claims cost and incurred but not reported claims 
estimates for future claims costs would include costs and other factors such as the type of injury or claim  required services by providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claim  and governmental regulations 
if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns  the company may be required to record additional expense or expense reductions which could be material to the company s results of operations 
additional insurance coverage exists for excessive or catastrophic claims 
stock based compensation 
the company grants stock options having a fixed number of shares and an exercise price equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant to certain executive officers  directors and key employees 
the company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations because the company believes the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is generally not recognized for plans in which the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and the number of shares subject to exercise is fixed 
had compensation cost for the company s stock based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
 net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts net income as reported    less pro forma effect of stock option grants pro forma    basic earnings per share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma as restated  see note to the consolidated financial statements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes standards that require companies to record the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions using the fair value method 
transition under sfas no 
r requires using a modified version of prospective application under which compensation costs are recorded for all unvested share based payments outstanding or a modified retrospective method under which all prior periods impacted by sfas no 
are restated 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec announced the adoption of a new rule that delays the compliance date for the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the sec s new rule will allow implementation at the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company intends to adopt sfas no 
r in the company also periodically awards restricted stock having a fixed number of shares at a purchase price that is set by the compensation committee of the company s board of directors  which purchase price may be set at zero  to certain executive officers  directors and key employees 
the company also accounts for restricted stock grants in accordance with apb no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 the company calculates compensation expense as the difference between the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and the purchase price  if any  and recognizes such amount on a straight line basis over the period in which the restricted stock award is earned by the recipient 
the company recognized compensation expense relating to its restricted stock awards of approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure relating to stock incentive plans

for the year 
this reduction was offset by the positive impact of better store shrinkage control 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in compared with of net sales in the increase for the year results from labor expenses and occupancy costs in the stores  higher corporate professional fees associated with our sarbanes oxley internal control compliance work  insurance costs  and fuel price increases affecting distribution costs
