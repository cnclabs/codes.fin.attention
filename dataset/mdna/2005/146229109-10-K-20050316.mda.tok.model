net income 
our fiscal net income increased to million as compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service 
historically  we have financed these needs through operating cash flow and funds borrowed under our senior credit facility 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving loan facility  and we expect that these sources will fund our ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures 
these sources of liquidity may be impacted by continued demand for our products and our ability to meet debt covenants under our credit facility 
net accounts receivable at january  were million compared to million at january  this increase primarily reflects higher levels of revenue in the latter part of fiscal as compared to the latter part of fiscal inventory levels at january  were million compared to million at january  increased inventory levels as of january  include inventory required to support forecasted revenue growth in all channels of distribution 
average inventory levels increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal average inventory levels are expected to be higher in fiscal based on increases in forecasted demand 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal and fiscal was million and million 
this increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by the growth in earnings and reductions in prepaid expenses  partially offset by increased levels of inventory to support demand and increased levels of accounts receivable resulting from growth in revenue and the timing of shipments 
net cash provided by our operating activities in fiscal was approximately million 
the increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the decline in inventory levels  our growth in earnings  and fluctuations in accounts receivable  accounts payable  and other liabilities 
we have invested million  million  and million  in capital expenditures during fiscal years   and we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal major areas for investment in fiscal included our distribution center expansion  retail store openings and remodelings  and fixturing programs for our key wholesale customers

net proceeds to us from the offering totaled million 
on november   we used approximately million of the proceeds to redeem approximately million in outstanding senior subordinated notes and pay a redemption premium of approximately million and related accrued interest charges of million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to terminate the berkshire partners llc management agreement and used approximately million to prepay amounts outstanding under the term loan as required by the senior credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
effective november   our credit facility was amended to increase our letter of credit sublimit to million from million and eliminate the requirement to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
effective july   our credit facility was amended to  among other things  increase the amount of the commitments under the revolving loan facility from million to million  provide for a basis point reduction in the applicable interest margin by prepaying our existing tranche b term loan and replacing it with a new tranche c term loan  and reduce the amount of our mandatory loan prepayment requirement from or of excess cash flow to or of excess cash flow  depending on the applicable leverage ratio 
pursuant to the amendment  we are also permitted to repurchase up to million of additional senior subordinated notes  which we may consider from time to time 
principal borrowings under the term loan are due and payable in quarterly installments of  from march  through september   and four quarterly payments of approximately million from december  through september  interest on the term loan is payable at the end of interest rate reset periods  which vary in length but in no case exceed six months 
the outstanding balance of the revolving loan facility is payable in full on august  interest is payable quarterly on base rate borrowings under the revolving loan facility and may be payable more frequently in the event we choose a eurodollar rate option available under the terms of the senior credit facility 
no principal payments are required on the senior subordinated notes prior to their scheduled maturity in august beginning august   we may redeem all or part of the senior subordinated notes as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest is payable semi annually on the senior subordinated notes in february and august of each year 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering  our semi annual interest payments on the senior subordinated notes were million 
after giving effect to the redemption of million of the principal amount of these senior subordinated notes in november  our semi annual interest payment is now approximately million 
the senior credit facility  as amended  sets forth mandatory and optional prepayment conditions that may result in our use of cash to reduce our debt obligations  including payments of i of the net cash proceeds from an equity issuance by carter s  inc  excluding  among other things  any issuance of equity in connection with employee or director stock plans or a permitted acquisition and ii or of consolidated excess cash flow or prior to the july  amendment  depending on the applicable leverage ratio  as both terms are defined in the amended senior credit facility 
accordingly  we made principal prepayments of approximately million on march  and million on march  no such prepayment is required in fiscal the lenders will apply such prepayments first to the term loan and  second  to permanently reduce the revolving loan facility 
subject to certain conditions in the senior credit facility  we may make optional prepayments of our debt obligations without premium or penalty 
the lenders will apply such optional prepayments according to our instruction 
in december  march  and december  we prepaid an additional million  million  and million in term loan indebtedness 
at january   we had approximately million of debt outstanding  consisting of million of senior subordinated notes  million in term loan borrowings  and no revolver borrowings  exclusive of approximately million of outstanding letters of credit 
average outstanding letters of credit were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal at january   we had approximately million of financing available under our revolver 
as previously provided by a management agreement with berkshire partners llc  we agreed to  among other things  pay berkshire partners an annual management fee of million per year for four years  commencing on the first anniversary of the acquisition 
we paid this fee quarterly  in advance 
as described above  upon completion of our initial public offering  this management fee agreement was terminated 
on july   we paid a cash dividend of approximately million on the outstanding shares of carter s  inc s common stock to the stockholders of record as of july  concurrently  we paid a special bonus of approximately million to our vested option holders 
these payments were funded using cash on hand as well as borrowings under our revolving loan facility  as described above 
we have no current intention of paying further dividends 
our credit facility imposes certain covenants  requirements  and restrictions on actions by us and our subsidiaries that  among other things  restrict the payment of dividends beyond the dividend noted above 
in july of  we decided to exit our sewing facilities located in costa rica given our ability to obtain lower costs from third party suppliers 
as a result of these closures  in fiscal  we recorded approximately  of accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold   of asset impairment charges   of severance  and  of other exit costs 
we also incurred approximately  of federal income tax expense in fiscal and  in fiscal related to the dissolution of the costa rican subsidiaries included in the provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  we recorded  in severance and other exit costs related to these closures 
the following table summarizes as of january   the maturity or expiration dates of mandatory contractual obligations and commitments for the following fiscal years dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt   interest on debt variable rate a     fixed rate b      operating leases see note to the consolidated financial statements total financial obligations     letters of credit   purchase obligations c  total financial obligations and commitments   a reflects estimated variable rate interest on obligations outstanding on our term loan as of january  using an interest rate of rate in effect at january  
b reflects fixed interest on our senior subordinated notes 
c unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligations category above relates to commitments for inventory purchases 
amounts reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable or other current liabilities are excluded from the table above 
in addition to the total contractual obligations and commitments in the table above  we have post retirement benefit obligations  included in other current and other long term liabilities  as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
based on our current level of operations  anticipated cost savings  and operating improvements  we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash  together with amounts available under the revolving loan facility  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
we may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of the principal amount of our term loan on or before august  and the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes on or prior to maturity in effects of inflation and deflation we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices 
while we have been successful in offsetting such deflationary pressures through product improvements and lower costs with the expansion of our global sourcing capabilities  if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain further price reductions from our global suppliers  our profitability may be affected 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability  with generally lower sales and gross profit in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 
over the past five fiscal years  approximately of our consolidated net sales were generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
accordingly  our results of operations for the first and second quarters of any year are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each fiscal year 
during these peak periods we have historically borrowed under the revolving loan facility 
peak borrowings on our revolving loan facility in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize wholesale and mass channel revenue after shipment of products to customers  when title passes and when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred 
in certain cases  in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the product has been shipped and when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business  we grant certain accommodations and allowances to our wholesale and mass channel customers 
such amounts are reflected as reductions of net sales 
for certain accommodations related to cooperative co op advertising for which we can determine the fair value  such amounts are classified as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale 
we reduce revenue for customer returns and deductions 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed regularly by our credit and collections department 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
during fiscal  we contracted with a third party service to provide us with the fair value of co op advertising arrangements entered into with certain of our major wholesale and mass channel customers 
such fair value is determined based upon  among other factors  comparable market analysis for similar advertisements 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer reseller eitf  we have included the fair value of these arrangements of approximately  in fiscal as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations rather than as a reduction of revenue 
co op advertising arrangements in previous fiscal years were treated as a reduction of revenue in accordance with eitf as we had determined that it was impracticable to obtain the fair value of those arrangements 
inventory we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
goodwill and tradename as of january   we had approximately million in goodwill and tradename assets 
the fair value of the carter s tradename was estimated at the acquisition to be approximately million using a discounted cash flow analysis  which examined the hypothetical cost savings that accrue as a result of our ownership of the tradename 
the cash flows  which incorporated both historical and projected financial performance  were discounted using a discount rate of ten percent 
the tradename was determined to have an indefinite life 
the carrying value of these assets is subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year 
factors affecting such impairment reviews include the continued market acceptance of our offered products and the development of new products 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances 
our impairment review of goodwill is based on the estimated fair values of the underlying businesses 
these estimated fair values are based on estimates of the future cash flows of the businesses 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for health insurance  workers compensation  incentive compensation  professional fees  and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on actual commitments  statistical trends  and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal  and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant  and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation arrangements we account for stock based compensation on stock options under the intrinsic value method  whereby we record compensation expense equal to the difference between the exercise price of the stock option and the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of the option grant 
for disclosure purposes only  we also estimate the impact on our net income of applying the fair value method of measuring compensation cost on stock options with the fair value  prior to our initial public offering  determined under the minimum value method as provided by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
for stock issued or sold outright to employees  directors  or third parties  we measure expense as the difference between the price paid by the recipient and the fair market value of the stock on the date of issuance or sale 
prior to our initial public offering  in the absence of a public market for carter s  inc s common stock  management and the board of directors estimated the market value of carter s  inc s common stock for all option grants and stock issuances using an approach that applies a multiple to adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization  and also excludes acquisition related charges  write downs of long lived assets  closure costs  and a deferred charge write off 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
additionally  we will use the modified prospective method of adoption  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r and for all subsequent stock options granted thereafter 
the impact of adoption  based upon current options outstanding  is estimated to result in an aggregate reduction in third and fourth quarter of fiscal pre tax earnings of approximately million or approximately per diluted share 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletins arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing arb  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company 
forward looking statements statements contained herein that relate to our future performance  including  without limitation  statements with respect to our anticipated results of operations or level of business for fiscal or any other future period  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on current expectations only  and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated  or projected 
among the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include a decrease in sales to or the loss of one or more of our key customers  downward pressure on our prices  disruptions in foreign supply sources  negative publicity  the loss of one or more of our major suppliers for raw materials  increased competition in the baby and young children s apparel market  our substantial leverage which increases our exposure to interest rate risk and could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to repay principal  the impact of governmental regulations and environmental risks applicable to our business  and seasonal fluctuations in the children s apparel business 
these risks are described under the heading risk factors 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the operation of our business  we have market risk exposures including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates 
these risks and our strategies to manage our exposure to them are discussed below 
we contract for production with third parties primarily in the far east and south and central america 
while these contracts are stated in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and the local currencies of these contractors 
due to the number of currencies involved  we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on net income in future years 
in order to manage this risk  we source products from approximately vendors worldwide  providing us with flexibility in our production should significant fluctuations occur between the united states and various local currencies 
to date  such exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our senior credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
at january   our outstanding debt aggregated million  of which million bore interest at a variable rate  so that an increase of in the applicable rate would increase our annual interest cost by  and could have an adverse effect on our net income and cash flow 
other risks there also are other risks in the operation of our business specifically related to raw material pricing and our global sourcing network 
the principal raw materials we use are finished fabrics and trim materials 
prices for these materials are affected by changes in market demand  and there can be no assurance that prices for these and other raw materials will not increase in the near future 
these materials are available from more than one supplier  which enables us to negotiate pricing 
however  the loss of one or more of these suppliers could temporarily interrupt our supply  which could have an adverse effect on our sales and increase our costs 
we currently source substantially all of our production from our offshore operations and third party manufacturers located in foreign countries 
as a result  we may be adversely affected by political instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries  the imposition of new regulations relating to imports  duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  any significant decreases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  and restrictions on the transfer of funds 
these and other factors could result in the interruption of production in offshore facilities  delay receipt of the products into the united states  or affect our operating income 
our future performance may be subject to such factors  which are beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we carefully select our sourcing agents  and in an effort to mitigate the possible disruption in product flow  we place production in various countries we believe to be of lower risk 
we continually evaluate opportunities to improve our products and reduce our costs 
our remaining sewing facilities  located in mexico  continue to provide us with an advantageous cost structure 
if we determine in the future that we are able to source products currently sewn in mexico at a significantly lower cost with superior quality elsewhere  we would develop a plan to exit such facilities and incur closure related costs 
we enter into various purchase order commitments with full package suppliers 
we can cancel these arrangements  although in some instances  we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation 
historically  such cancellations and related termination charges have occurred infrequently and have not had a material impact on our business 
however  as we rely more heavily on our full package global sourcing network  we expect to incur more of these termination charges  which could increase our cost of goods sold
