item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in part ii  item of the form k 
overview shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers 
as of january   we operated stores in states in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our ability to identify and react to fashion changes is a key factor in our sales and earnings performance 
our marketing effort targets middle income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively and earn attractive store level returns 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers who choose to serve themselves 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we prefer to locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
our fiscal year consists of a week period ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to the years  and relate respectively to the fiscal years ended january   january   and february  fiscal years  and consisted of weeks 
restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the us securities and exchange commission the sec released a letter expressing the sec s views on certain lease accounting matters as they relate to the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
based on these views we  along with numerous other retailers  reviewed our lease accounting practices and determined that our accounting for the lease commencement date was not consistent with gaap 
historically  and consistent with practice prevalent throughout the retailing industry  we recognized straight line rent expense for leases beginning on the earlier of rent commencement date or the store opening date 
this had the effect of excluding the build out period of our stores from the calculation of the period over which we expense rent 
we have now changed this practice to include the build out period in our calculation of rent expense 
while this change results in an acceleration of the commencement of rent expense for each lease  the total rent due under the lease remains unchanged and is amortized over a greater number of months 
this change has no effect on historical or future cash flows or the timing or amounts of payments under related leases 
we believe it is appropriate to align our historical financial statements with the sec s comments on lease accounting under gaap  and we have done so  as reflected in our decision to restate results for prior periods 
this restatement reduced net income by  and  for fiscal years and  respectively  and resulted in a million reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the effects of the restatement on our consolidated balance sheet  consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented 
the accompanying management discussion and analysis includes the impact of these restatements 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgements in our reported financial results 
these judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgements are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred 
we evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets  impairment losses are recorded 
when events such as these occur  the impaired assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgement and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
deferred income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
a valuation allowance has been provided for certain state operating losses recorded as a deferred tax asset 
we anticipate that future taxable income  and prior year taxable income during loss carryback periods  will not be sufficient to recover the full amount of deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax 
we have also been involved in tax audits 
at any given time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
outlook in  we initiated certain changes to our business that we believe positively impacted our sales and earnings in the last half of we expect the changes will also benefit our financial performance 
certain of these changes are as follows store openings currently  we expect to open between and new stores and close four stores in these new stores will be located in large and small markets within our existing geographic areas 
our intention is to fill in certain under penetrated larger markets with additional stores  thereby increasing the performance of the overall market 
we also intend to enter smaller markets that we can fully penetrate with one or two stores 
we generally can advertise more effectively in these markets  which helps to create immediate brand awareness 
new store design in late  we developed a new design for shoe carnival stores 
this design  in addition to updating the color scheme  changed the placement of product on the sales floor  allowing us to place more emphasis on our women s non athletic product 
prominently displaying the women s merchandise is one way in which we expect to achieve our goal of raising the percent of sales of women s merchandise from of total sales in to between an over the next five years 
currently  we have about stores with the new design 
over the next four years  we intend to remodel virtually all remaining stores to the latest store design 
for  we intend to fully remodel stores and partially remodel another stores 
additionally  we are going to roll out a new graphics package to all stores this year that will tie in to our new advertising campaign 
for remodels and the enhanced graphics package  we intend to spend approximately million in merchandise early in the spring of  we recognized that our non athletic product mix was not as fashion forward as it needed to be 
this was particularly true in our women s category 
as a result  beginning in the fall of and continuing into the spring of  we significantly increased the assortment of fashion footwear in both our men s and women s non athletic categories 
marketing in late  we initiated a number of changes in our marketing program  including the hiring of a new advertising agency 
a new television and radio advertising campaign was introduced during the easter selling season with a fresh creative message that highlights the fashion and value of our improved women s product assortment 
we also changed our grand opening promotion for the new store openings  which highlights the women s side of our business and targets a woman consumer better than we did in prior years 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in  a increase over net sales of million in the increase was attributable to the sales generated by the stores opened in and the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in  partially offset by the closing of four stores and a comparable store sales decrease of 
while sales of athletic footwear and accessories in our comparable stores increased slightly for the year  our men s  women s and children s non athletic footwear categories each experienced declines in comparable store sales 
in the first two quarters of we saw declines in our comparable store sales  but ended the year with back to back quarterly comparable store sales gains 
we believe the improved sales performance in the second half of the year was at least partly due to enhancing the fashion content of our merchandise offering and to improving the way we advertise to our customers 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in  a increase from gross profit of million in our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased and buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
the increase in the merchandise margin as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by a decline in the amount of markdowns necessary to liquidate seasonal product

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  these expenses remained unchanged from the prior year at

the increase in the merchandise margin was primarily driven by increases in our adult athletic category and our children s category

liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows s fiscal years net income plus depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes lease incentives working capital increases other operating activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the change was primarily due to the slower growth in inventories due to fewer store openings during the year  the timing of payment of accounts payable resulting from the earlier receipt of spring merchandise coupled with a shift from an income tax receivable to payable position 
to a lesser extent  this increase in cash provided by operating activities was offset by a decline the amount of cash lease incentives obtained from landlords 
inventory on a per store basis was up over the prior year 
working capital increased slightly to million at january  from million at january  the current ratio at january  was as compared to at january  long term debt as a percentage of total capital long term debt plus shareholders equity was at january   as compared with at january  capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in these amounts include  of capital lease obligations incurred in no capital lease obligations were incurred in or of the fiscal capital expenditures incurred  million was for fiscal new stores  million was for stores to open in fiscal  and million was for remodeling and relocation of existing stores 
the remaining capital expenditures in were primarily for various store improvements  loss prevention equipment  and technology 
lease incentives received from landlords were  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  including assets acquired through leasing arrangements  are expected to be million to million in fiscal the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
in fiscal  we intend to open approximately to stores at an expected aggregate cost of between million and million 
the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels  visual presentation enhancements and various other store improvements  along with continued investments in technology 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital expenditures for a new store in are expected to average approximately  and lease incentives received from landlords are expected to average  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in as compared to  in this decrease is primarily due to a more cost effective advertising program 
on a per store basis  for the stores opened during  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged  in  we completed a forward looking logistics study evaluating the need for additional distribution center capacity as we grow 
based on our current growth plans  the results of the study identified the need to have additional distribution capacity available by the end of our current plan is to replace our existing  square foot distribution center with a new  square foot facility 
construction is anticipated to begin in the spring of preliminary cost estimates for land  building and equipment are expected to range between million and million 
we are contemplating that this project will be financed through a long term debt facility  however  alternative financing options will be explored during the coming year 
no expenditures for this project are anticipated to be incurred in our unsecured credit facility provides for up to million in cash advances on a revolving basis and commercial letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit line are based on eligible inventory 
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were million at january  as compared to million at january  letters of credit outstanding at january  were million 
as of january   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
on april   the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to april  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
significant contractual obligations as of january  and the periods in which payments are due include payments due by period s total less than year years years after years contractual obligations line of credit letters of credit capital lease obligations operating leases purchase commitments deferred compensation total contractual obligations see notes and as contained in part ii  item for a discussion of long term debt and leases  respectively 
we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at january  or january   except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business 
seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
a change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the credit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by approximately  in and  in
