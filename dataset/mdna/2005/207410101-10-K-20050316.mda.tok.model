item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data item  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
overview of conmed corporation conmed corporation conmed  the company  we or us is a worldwide developer  manufacturer and distributor of a broad portfolio of advanced surgical instruments and medical devices with an emphasis on minimally invasive procedures and monitoring 
our products are used by surgeons and physicians in a variety of specialties including orthopedics  general surgery  gynecology  neurosurgery and gastroenterology 
we offer surgical products and technologies to our customers through six principal product lines 
these product lines and the percentage of consolidated revenues associated with each  are as follows arthroscopy powered surgical instruments electrosurgery patient care endosurgery endoscopic technologies consolidated net sales a significant amount of our products are used in surgical procedures with approximately of our revenues derived from the sale of disposable products 
we manufacture substantially all of our products in facilities located in the united states 
we market our products both domestically and internationally directly to customers and through distributors 
international sales approximated  and in  and  respectively 
business environment  opportunities and challenges the aging of the worldwide population along with lifestyle changes  continued cost containment pressures on healthcare systems and the desire of clinicians and administrators to use less invasive or noninvasive procedures are important trends which are driving the growth for our surgical and patient care products 
we have historically used strategic business acquisitions and exclusive distribution relationships to diversify our product offerings  increase our market share in certain product lines and realize economies of scale 
in we made important progress in broadening our arthroscopy product line with the acquisition of bionx implants  inc the bionx acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  we announced an agreement with dolphin medical  inc  a subsidiary of osi systems  inc  under which we became the exclusive north american distributor for a full line of dolphin r pulse oximetry products 
these products are included in our patient care product line 
on september  we completed the acquisition of certain products of the endoscopic technologies division of cr bard  inc the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquired product line consists of various disposable products used by gastroenterologists to diagnose and treat diseases of the digestive tract 
several of the products are used in conjunction with electrosurgical devices to cause hemostasis following the removal of diseased tissue 
it is anticipated that these products will complement our current electrosurgery product offerings 
manufacturing of the products is currently being conducted in various cr bard facilities under a transition agreement 
it is anticipated that future manufacturing will be shifted to our facilities during the third quarter of continued innovation and commercialization of new proprietary products and processes are essential elements of our long term growth strategy 
in february  we unveiled several new products at the american academy of orthopedic surgeons annual meeting which will enhance our arthroscopy and powered instrument product offerings 
our reputation as an innovator is exemplified by these recent product introductions  which include an advantage r turbo arthroscopic shaver system  pinn acl r cross pin device  lightwave tm suction ablator  powerpromax tm powered instrument handpieces  batteries and attachments  threvo tm triple loaded suture anchor  and superrevo r bio anchor r duet tm impact tm suture anchors pre threaded with herculine tm 
our current research initiatives include the development of reflectance technology products 
this technology permits non invasive analysis of blood oxygen levels in clinical situations which previously could not be accomplished using traditional non invasive techniques pro r 
we anticipate a product launch in the united states and europe 
additionally  in we acquired technology for a product referred to as endotracheal cardiac output monitor ecom 
our ecom product offering is expected to replace catheter monitoring of cardiac output with a specially designed endotracheal tube which utilizes proprietary bio impedance technology 
a large portion of the development of this product  as well as future product enhancements  will be conducted in our newly created research subsidiary in israel 
in june  conmed and our israeli subsidiary were awarded a million grant from the israel us binational industrial research and development foundation to assist in product development 
we anticipate a product launch in the united states and europe 
certain of our products  particularly our line of surgical suction instruments  tubing and ecg electrodes  are more commodity in nature  with limited opportunity for product differentiation 
these products compete in mature  price sensitive markets 
as a result  while sales volumes have continued to increase  we have experienced and expect that we will continue to experience pricing and margin pressures in these product lines 
we believe that we may continue to profitably compete in these product lines by maintaining and improving our low cost manufacturing structure 
in addition  we expect to continue to use cash generated from these low margin  low capital intensive products to invest in  improve and expand higher margin product lines 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of conmed corporation 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title has been transferred to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment 
the following policies apply to our major categories of revenue transactions o sales to customers are evidenced by firm purchase orders 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer when product is shipped 
payment by the customer is due under fixed payment terms 
o we place certain of our capital equipment with customers in return for commitments to purchase disposable products over time periods generally ranging from one to three years 
in these circumstances  no revenue is recognized upon capital equipment shipment and we recognize revenue upon the disposable product shipment 
the cost of the equipment is amortized over the term of individual commitment agreements 
o product returns are only accepted at the discretion of the company and in accordance with our returned goods policy 
historically the level of product returns has not been significant 
we accrue for sales returns  rebates and allowances based upon an analysis of historical customer returns and credits  rebates  discounts and current market conditions 
o the company s terms of sale to customers generally do not include any obligations to perform future services 
limited warranties are generally provided for capital equipment sales and provisions for warranty are provided at the time of product sale based upon an analysis of historical data 
o amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling have been included in net sales 
shipping and handling costs included in selling and administrative expense were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
o we sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and  therefore  believe there is no material concentration of credit risk 
o we assess the risk of loss on accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this risk assessment 
historically  losses on accounts receivable have not been material 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses resulting from accounts receivable 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on going basis 
such marketplace changes may result in our products becoming obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of our products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate 
business acquisitions we have a history of growth through acquisitions  including the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition in assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
other intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our business 
estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows may be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
intangible assets which continue to be subject to amortization are also evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
an intangible asset is determined to be impaired when estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value to its current fair value 
although no goodwill or other intangible asset impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurance that future impairment will not occur 
it is our policy to perform annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter 
in connection with the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition  significant estimates were made in the million valuation of purchased in process research and development assets 
the purchased in process research and development value relates to next generation gastro intestinal products  which are expected to be released between the fourth quarter of and second quarter of the acquired projects include enhancements and upgrades to existing device technology  introduction of new device functionality and the development of new technology for gastro intestinal applications 
the value of the in process research and development was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated net cash flow stream associated with the in process technology of the related product sales 
estimated future net cash flows were discounted back to their present values using a discount rate of  which was based on the weighted average cost of capital for publicly traded companies within the medical device industry  adjusted for the stage of completion of each of the in process research and development projects 
the risk and return considerations surrounding the stage of completion were based on costs  man hours and complexity of the work completed versus to be completed and other risks associated with achieving commercial feasibility 
in total  these projects were approximately complete as of the acquisition date 
the total budgeted costs for the projects were approximately million and the remaining costs to complete these projects were approximately million as of the acquisition date 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technologies and products based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance may be made that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the future cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension plan we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all our employees 
overall benefit levels provided under the plan were reduced effective january  resulting in a reduction in the projected benefit obligation of approximately million 
major assumptions used in accounting for the plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and expected mortality 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated annually as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
lower market interest rates have resulted in us lowering the discount rate used in determining pension expense from in to in this change in assumption will result in higher pension expense during we have used an expected rate of return on pension plan assets of for purposes of determining the net periodic pension benefit cost 
in determining the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 
in addition  we consult with financial and investment management professionals in developing appropriate targeted rates of return 
we have estimated our rate of increase in employee compensation levels at consistent with our internal budgeting 
as of december   the company changed from the unisex pension mortality table to the group annuity reserving mortality table for purposes of determining expected mortality 
this change in assumption will result in higher pension expense during based on these and other factors  pension expense is estimated at approximately million 
actual expense may vary significantly from this estimate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes the recorded future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is approximately million at december  management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
we have established a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain net operating loss carryforwards recognized in connection with the bionx acquisition 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with the valuation allowance would be allocated to reduce goodwill 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain categories included in our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expense research and development expense write off of purchased in process research and development assets other expense income  net income from operations loss on early extinguishment of debt interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to sales for were million  an increase of million compared to sales of million in the bionx acquisition and bard endoscopic technologies acquisition accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for million 
the bionx acquisition and bard endoscopic technologies acquisition are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
o arthroscopy sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of the bionx acquisition and increased sales of our procedure specific  knee reconstruction  soft tissue fixation and video imaging products for arthroscopy and general surgery 
this increase was offset in part by reduced sales of integrated operating room systems and equipment 
o powered surgical instrument sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of increased sales of our powerpro r line of large bone instruments 
this increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our small bone instruments and specialty product offerings 
o patient care sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of increased sales of our pulse oximetry monitoring devices  ecg electrodes  surgical suction instruments and other patient care products 
o electrosurgery sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of increased sales of electrosurgical disposable ground pads and pencils 
o endosurgery sales increased million in to million from million in  as a result of increased sales of our various laparoscopic instrument products and systems 
o endoscopic technologies sales for were million representing the inclusion of results of operations for the former endoscopic technologies division of cr bard since the date of acquisition 
cost of sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased sales volumes in each of our principal product lines as described above 
gross profit margins decreased from in to in we incurred million and million of acquisition related expenses during and  respectively  which have been included in cost of sales 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in as compared to is principally due to the increase in acquisition related expenses 
the million of acquisition related charges included in costs of sales in  consists of the following million of expense which represents a portion of the step up to fair value recorded relating to the sale of inventory acquired through the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition  and million in charges representing the incremental costs we are incurring during a transition period in which we are continuing to purchase the acquired products from cr bard 
during  we expect to continue to experience higher incremental costs until manufacturing of the acquired products is integrated into our facilities during the third quarter of selling and administrative expense increased to million in as compared to million in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this increase of percentage points is attributable to increased selling expenses primarily associated with the transition to a larger  independent sales agent based sales force in our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines percentage points and increased administrative expenses associated with litigation against johnson johnson see note to the consolidated financial statements and our sarbanes oxley compliance program percentage points 
research and development expense was million in compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense increased to in from in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales is principally a result of increased spending on the development of our pro r reflectance pulse oximetry system and endotracheal cardiac output monitor for our patient care business 
the addition of the endoscopic technologies business in september also contributed to the increase in research and development expense 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we wrote off million and million of purchased in process research and development assets associated with the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition and bionx acquisition in and  respectively 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  other expense in consisted primarily of million of expenses associated with the termination of our surgical lights product offering and million of expenses related to the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition 
we expect to incur an additional million in expenses associated with the termination of our surgical lights product offering in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  other income in consisted of a million net gain on the settlement of a contractual dispute  million in pension settlement costs associated with the restructuring of our orthopedic sales force and million in acquisition costs related primarily to the acquisition of core dynamics  inc the core acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements and bionx acquisition 
during  we recorded million in losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of a portion of the term loans under our senior credit agreement through the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes 
see additional discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily a result of lower weighted average borrowings outstanding in as compared to and lower weighted average interest rates on our borrowings in as compared to in inclusive of the implicit finance charge on our accounts receivable sale facility 
the decrease in weighted average interest rates on our borrowing is primarily a result of our redemption of million in senior subordinated notes in see note to the consolidated financial statements in favor of lower cost bank debt 
a provision for income taxes has been recorded at an effective rate of in and in the effective rate for was lower than that recorded in and the united states statutory rate of as a result of an increase in the estimated benefits to be realized from the extraterritorial income exclusion eti tax rules on foreign sales 
the effective rate in increased from the statutory rate as a result of the non deductibility for income tax purposes of the bionx in process research and development charge discussed above 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
we expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction to result in an increase in the effective rate of approximately two percentage points for compared to the effective tax rate of 
see additional discussion and a reconciliation of the united states statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate in note to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to sales for were million  an increase of million compared to sales of million in the core acquisition and bionx acquisition accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for million 
the bionx and core acquisitions are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
o arthroscopy sales increased million in to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the bionx acquisition and inclusion of full year results from two businesses acquired during engaged in the design  manufacture and installation of integrated operating room systems and equipment 
o powered surgical instrument sales increased million in to million from million in  primarily as a result of increased sales of our new powerpro r line of powered instrument products 
o patient care sales increased million in to million from million in as sales of our ecg and surgical suction product lines continued to face significant competition and pricing pressures 
o electrosurgery sales increased million in to million from million in  primarily as a result of increased sales of our new system r electrosurgical generator 
o endosurgery sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of the inclusion of full year sales from the core acquisition 
cost of sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of the increased sales volumes in each of our principal product lines as described above 
gross profit margins decreased from in to in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  we incurred million of acquisition related charges which have been included in cost of sales 
additionally  as noted above  our ecg and surgical suction product lines continue to face significant competition and pricing pressures resulting in lower gross margins for these product lines 
selling and administrative expense increased to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expense increased to in from in this increase of percentage points is primarily attributable to the transition to a larger  independent sales agent based sales force in our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines 
during  we restructured our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument sales force by increasing our domestic sales force from to sales representatives 
the increase is part of our integration plan for the bionx acquisition 
as part of the sales force restructuring  we converted direct employee sales representatives into nine independent sales agent groups 
as a result of this restructuring  we now have exclusive sales agent groups managing arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument sales representatives 
the transition of the sales force and greater number of sales staff is expected to result in higher future sales growth in our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines 
research and development expense was million in compared to million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expense decreased to in from in due to higher net sales 
the increase in research and development spending is principally as a result of the bionx acquisition and represents continued research and development efforts focused primarily on product development in the arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the first quarter of we wrote off purchased in process research and development assets of million associated with the bionx acquisition 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  other income in consisted primarily of a million net gain on the settlement of a contractual dispute  million in pension settlement costs associated with the restructuring of our orthopedic sales force and million in costs related primarily to the core acquisition and bionx acquisition 
other expense in consisted of a million loss on the settlement of a patent dispute 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes during and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million 
this amount represents call premium and unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the purchase 
during  we recorded an expense in the amount of million related to the refinancing of our debt agreements 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily a result of lower weighted average borrowings outstanding in as compared to and lower weighted average interest rates on our borrowings in as compared to in inclusive of the implicit finance charge on our accounts receivable sale facility 
the decrease in weighted average interest rates on our borrowing is primarily a result of our redemption of million in senior subordinated notes in see note to the consolidated financial statements in favor of lower cost bank debt 
a provision for income taxes has been recorded at an effective rate of in and in the effective rate for was substantially higher than that recorded in and the united states statutory rate of as a result of the non deductibility for income tax purposes of the bionx in process research and development charge discussed above 
a reconciliation of the united states statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investments  working capital requirements and payments on indebtedness under the senior credit agreement 
we have historically met these liquidity requirements with funds generated from operations  including sales of accounts receivable and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we use term borrowings  including borrowings under our senior credit agreement and borrowings under separate loan facilities  in the case of real property purchases  to finance our acquisitions 
we also have the ability to raise funds through the sale of stock or we may issue debt through a private placement or public offering 
operating cash flows our net working capital position was million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in was favorably impacted by the following noncash charges to income depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  pension costs in excess of pension contributions  the write off of purchased in process research and development assets and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs 
also benefiting cash flow from operations were the income tax benefit of stock option exercises  increased sales of accounts receivable  increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and decreases in inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities in was unfavorably impacted principally by increases in other assets and decreases in other liabilities as a result of timing of cash payments  increased cash payments for income taxes and increases in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales levels 
investing cash flows capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures represent the ongoing capital investment requirements of our business and are expected to continue at the same approximate rate during net cash flow used in investing activities in consisted primarily of million in payments related to the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition 
financing cash flows net cash provided by used in financing activities during consisted of the following million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan see note to the consolidated financial statements  million in net repayments under the senior credit agreement  million in net repayments on mortgage notes  million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes  million in payments related to the offering of the convertible senior subordinated notes  million net change in cash overdrafts  and the repurchase of million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
our senior credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
at december  there were no amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
the aggregate amount outstanding on the term loan was million at december  the term loan is scheduled to be repaid in quarterly installments over a period of approximately years  with scheduled principal payments of million annually through december increasing to million in and the remaining balance outstanding due in december we have made all scheduled term loan repayments as they have come due 
we may also be required  under certain circumstances  to make additional principal payments based on excess annual cash flow as defined in the senior credit agreement 
no such payments were required during interest rates on the term facility and the revolving credit facility are at the london interbank offered rate libor plus at december  
the senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which have been sold in connection with our accounts receivable sales agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require maintenance of certain working capital levels and financial ratios  prohibit dividend payments and restrict the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities  including acquisitions and dispositions 
the senior credit agreement contains a material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to access additional funding under our revolving credit facility should a material adverse change in our business occur 
we are also required  under certain circumstances  to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issue of equity and asset sales 
outstanding debt assumed in connection with the purchase of property in largo  florida utilized by our conmed linvatec subsidiary consists of a note bearing interest at per annum with semiannual payments of principal and interest through june the class a note  and a note bearing interest at per annum compounded semiannually through june  after which semiannual payments of principal and interest will commence  continuing through june the class c note 
the principal balances outstanding on the class a note and class c note aggregated million and million  respectively  at december  these loans are secured by our largo  florida property 
on november  we completed an offering  in a private placement  of million in convertible senior subordinated notes the notes due this offering has allowed us to fix interest rates on million of our total outstanding long term debt at 
the notes represent our subordinated unsecured obligations and are convertible under the following circumstances  as defined in the bond indenture  into a combination of cash and conmed common stock when the closing price of our common stock for each of or more consecutive trading days in a period of consecutive trading days exceeds of the applicable conversion price  after any consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price per  principal amount of the notes was equal to or less than of the average conversion value of the notes  if we call a note for redemption  and based on certain corporate transactions such as if we are party to a consolidation  merger or binding share exchange in which over of our outstanding shares of common stock would be converted into cash  securities or other property  or if another fundamental change as defined in the bond indenture occurs 
upon conversion  the holder of each note will receive the conversion value of the note payable in cash up to the principal amount of the note and conmed common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
amounts in excess of the principal amount are at an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of the note which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes mature on november  and are not redeemable by us prior to november  holders of the notes will be able to require that we repurchase some or all of the notes on november   and we have determined that the notes contain two embedded derivatives 
the embedded derivatives are recorded at fair value in other long term liabilities and changes in their value are recorded through the consolidated statement of income 
the embedded derivatives have a nominal value  and it is our belief that any change in their fair value would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the notes offering resulted in gross proceeds of million  less million in initial purchaser s discount and other offering related payments which are being amortized to interest expense over a year period through november  the earliest date at which we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes 
net proceeds from the offering and cash on hand were used to repay million on the term loan and a further million in borrowings then outstanding on the revolving credit facility under our senior credit agreement 
the revolving credit facility borrowings were used to finance a portion of the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in conjunction with the notes offering  we repurchased million of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result of the million prepayment on the term loan  we recorded million in losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees 
initial purchasers for the notes included ubs securities llc  banc of america securities llc  citigroup global markets inc and jp morgan securities inc the initial purchasers 
the notes were resold by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers within the meaning of rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes and the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion have not been registered under the securities act or any applicable state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the united states  absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements 
we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on form s  which is not yet effective  which will enable the qualified institutional buyers to resell their holdings in the notes 
on february   we announced that our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock  although no more than million may be purchased in any calendar year 
the repurchase program calls for shares to be purchased in the open market or in private transactions from time to time 
we may suspend or discontinue the share repurchase program at any time 
we expect to repurchase shares to offset the dilutive effect of the issuance of shares under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  but we may also repurchase shares depending upon market conditions and the market price of our common stock 
we expect to finance repurchases from cash on hand and amounts available under our senior credit agreement 
management believes that cash flow from operations  including accounts receivable sales  cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreement will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating working capital requirements  debt service  funding of capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in the foreseeable future 
see item business forward looking statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an accounts receivable sales agreement pursuant to which we and certain of our subsidiaries sell on an ongoing basis certain accounts receivable to conmed receivables corporation crc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary of conmed corporation 
crc may in turn sell up to an aggregate million undivided percentage ownership interest in such receivables the asset interest to a bank the purchaser 
the purchaser s share of collections on accounts receivable are calculated as defined in the accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended 
effectively  collections on the pool of receivables flow first to the purchaser and then to crc  but to the extent that the purchaser s share of collections may be less than the amount of the purchaser s asset interest  there is no recourse to conmed or crc for such shortfall 
for receivables which have been sold  conmed corporation and its subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities as agent for the purchaser 
as of december  and  the undivided percentage ownership interest in receivables sold by crc to the purchaser aggregated million and million  respectively  which has been accounted for as a sale and reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable 
expenses associated with the sale of accounts receivable  including the purchaser s financing costs to purchase the accounts receivable  were million and million  in and  respectively  and are included in interest expense 
there are certain statistical ratios  primarily related to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable  which must be calculated and maintained on the pool of receivables in order to continue selling to the purchaser 
the pool of receivables is in full compliance with these ratios 
management believes that additional accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business will be of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements for sale under the accounts receivables sales agreement 
in the event that new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale  then collections on sold receivables will flow to the purchaser rather than being used to fund new receivable purchases 
to the extent that such collections would not be available to conmed in the form of new receivables purchases  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment  on an annual basis  from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment was amended effective october  whereby it was extended for an additional year under substantially the same terms and conditions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter amounts in thousands 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders for goods and services placed in the ordinary course of business 
there were no capital lease obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt      purchase obligations   operating lease obligations      total contractual obligations      in addition to the above contractual obligations  we are required to make periodic interest payments on our long term debt obligations  see additional discussion under item a

we may also be required to make contributions to our pension plan which are not expected to exceed million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we have reserved shares of common stock issuance to employees and directors under three shareholder approved stock option plans 
the exercise price on all outstanding options is equal to the quoted fair market value of the stock at the date of grant 
stock options are non transferable other than on death and generally become exercisable over a five year period from date of grant and expire ten years from date of grant see note to the consolidated financial statements
