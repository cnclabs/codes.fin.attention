through general re  berkshire also reinsures life and health risks 
in primary insurance activities  berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks 
in reinsurance activities  berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities 
berkshire s principal insurance businesses are geico  one of the five largest auto insurers in the us  general re  one of the four largest reinsurers in the world  berkshire hathaway reinsurance group bhrg and berkshire hathaway primary group 
berkshire s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations underwriting and investing 
accordingly  berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income 
a significant marketing strategy followed by all these businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength 
statutory surplus of berkshire s insurance businesses totaled approximately billion at december  this superior capital strength creates opportunities  especially with respect to reinsurance activities  to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet unique needs of sophisticated insurance and reinsurance buyers 
additional information regarding berkshire s insurance and reinsurance operations follows 

table of contents management s discussion continued insurance underwriting continued geico geico provides primarily private passenger automobile coverages to insureds in states and the district of columbia 
geico policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company over the telephone  through the mail or via the internet 
this is a significant element in geico s strategy to be a low cost insurer 
in addition  geico strives to provide excellent service to customers  with the goal of establishing long term customer relationships 
geico s underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below 
dollars are in millions 
amount amount amount premiums written premiums earned losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting expenses total losses and expenses pre tax underwriting gain premiums earned in and increased and  respectively  over the corresponding prior year amounts 
the growth in premiums earned in for voluntary auto was and reflects an increase in policies in force during the past year and average rate increases of less than two percent 
during the third quarter of geico began selling auto insurance in new jersey  which will contribute to future policies in force growth 
in late and early  rate decreases have been implemented in several states in response to improved claims experience 
during  policies in force increased in the preferred risk markets and in the standard and nonstandard markets 
voluntary auto new business sales in increased compared to voluntary auto policies in force at december  were  higher than at december  and reflect strong growth in the standard and nonstandard lines 
losses and loss adjustment expenses in totaled  million  an increase of over the loss ratio declined to in compared to in and in primarily due to decreasing claim frequencies across all markets and most coverage types 
in  claims frequencies for physical damage coverages have decreased in the two to four percent range from while frequencies for bodily injury coverages decreased in the three to five percent range 
bodily injury severity in increased in the two to four percent range over while physical damage severity has increased in the three to six percent range 
incurred losses from catastrophe events totaled approximately million in primarily from the hurricanes in the third quarter compared to million in underwriting expenses in totaled  million  an increase of over  which increased over policy acquisition expenses in increased over to million reflecting increased advertising and other costs associated with the increase in policies in force

amounts are in millions 
pre tax underwriting premiums written premiums earned gain loss property casualty north american international 
life health property casualty north american property casualty premiums written in declined from and premiums written declined compared to international property and casualty premiums written in decreased from  which increased over the declines in reflect reductions in the amounts of business accepted over the past two years  offset in part by higher rates 
underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks 
management expects written premiums to continue to decline during  primarily due to maintaining underwriting discipline in an increasingly price competitive property casualty market 

table of contents insurance underwriting continued general re continued property casualty continued the decline in premiums earned in from north american operations was attributed to cancellations non renewals over new contracts estimated at million  partially offset by renewal rate increases and changes in renewal terms and conditions across all lines of business estimated at million 
the decline in premiums earned in from reflected cancellations non renewals exceeding new contracts estimated at million  partially offset by rate increases across all lines estimated at million 
the decline in international premiums earned in versus reflected the reductions of premium volume partially offset by a lower value of the us dollar 
in local currencies  premiums earned declined compared with  which  in turn  declined in versus the north american property casualty business produced a pre tax underwriting gain of million in compared with a gain of million in  and a loss of  million in the million net underwriting gain in was comprised of current accident year gains of million  partially offset by million in prior accident year losses 
current accident year results included approximately million of catastrophe losses from the four hurricanes that struck the southeast united states in the third quarter 
despite these losses  current accident year underwriting results benefited from the favorable effects of re pricing efforts and improved coverage terms and conditions implemented over the past three years and a one time reduction of million in pension expense during the third quarter  resulting from the curtailment of certain benefits at the end of underwriting results for included net underwriting gains for the current accident year of million compared to million in the current accident year results in and reflected re pricing efforts and unusually low amounts of large individual and catastrophe related property losses 
in both and  the current accident year gains were reduced or eliminated by additional losses million in and  million in established for prior accident years loss occurrences 
in  the million charge related to prior accident year loss occurrences consisted of million of increases in casualty and workers compensation reserves  million related to discount accretion on workers compensation reserves and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance coverages  offset by million of reserve reductions for prior year property losses and million of gains associated with contract commutations and settlements 
the aforementioned increases in workers compensation reserves in reflected escalating medical utilization and inflation  and casualty reserve increases related primarily to losses under financial institutions errors and omissions and directors and officers lines of business and asbestos and environmental mass tort exposures 
the decrease in property reserves in was primarily due to reductions in estimated world trade center losses 
as previously stated  underwriting results in and included million and  million  respectively  in losses related to prior accident years  which included million and million  respectively  from discount accretion on workers compensation reserves and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts 
in  reserve increases also included million in increased loss estimates mostly related to casualty lines of business general liability  workers compensation  medical malpractice  auto liability and professional liability coverages  principally for the through accident years  partially offset by million of reserve reductions related to reduced estimates for certain world trade center claims 
although loss reserve levels are now believed to be adequate  there are no guarantees 
a relatively small change in the estimate of net reserves can produce large changes in annual underwriting results 
in addition  the timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual property losses are expected to continue to contribute to volatile periodic underwriting results in the future 
see critical accounting policies for additional information concerning loss reserves 
international property casualty businesses produced a pre tax underwriting loss of million in compared with a gain of million in  and a loss of million in underwriting results in include million of catastrophe losses from the third quarter hurricanes 
in  losses from catastrophes and large individual property losses were minimal and in totaled million  primarily from flood and storm losses in europe 
underwriting results for each of the last three years benefited from favorable results of the aviation business and relatively low non catastrophe property losses 
underwriting results of the international businesses have improved overall over the last two years as a result of re pricing efforts and more disciplined underwriting 
underwriting results of the international property and casualty businesses included losses from prior years loss occurrences of million in  million in and million in life and health life and health premiums earned in increased million over  which decreased by million compared with adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange  premiums earned increased in and declined in the increase in premiums earned is due in part to the strengthening of foreign currencies and an increase in european life business 
the decline in was primarily due to decreases in the group and individual health businesses in the us life health operations 
underwriting results for the global life health operations produced pre tax underwriting gains of million in and million in  compared with an underwriting loss of million in while both the us and international life health operations were profitable in both and  most of the gains were earned in the international life business 
the underwriting losses for were principally due to increased reserves on run off business in the us life health operations 

table of contents management s discussion continued insurance underwriting continued berkshire hathaway reinsurance group the berkshire hathaway reinsurance group bhrg underwrites excess of loss reinsurance and quota share coverages for insurers and reinsurers around the world 
bhrg s business includes catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance  excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk 
retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events 
other multi line reinsurance refers to other contracts that are written on both a quota share and excess basis  and include participations in and contracts with lloyd s syndicates 
amounts in the table below are in millions 
premiums earned pre tax underwriting gain loss catastrophe and individual risk retroactive reinsurance other multi line total catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification  often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of billion  and cover catastrophe risks such as hurricanes  earthquakes or other natural disasters or other property risks such as aviation and aerospace  commercial multi peril or terrorism 
catastrophe and individual business written totaled about billion in and billion in the level of business written in future periods will vary  perhaps materially  based upon market conditions and management s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates 
premiums written in included million to reinstate coverages as a result of the third quarter hurricane losses 
in  underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business included estimated catastrophe losses of million  primarily from four hurricanes that struck the us and caribbean during the third quarter 
the catastrophe and individual risk business produced substantial underwriting gains in and due to the lack of catastrophic or otherwise large loss events 
however  catastrophic losses such as the recent hurricane losses are anticipated to occur over time  which could exceed the gains earned in recent years 
the pre tax maximum probable loss from a single event at december  is estimated to be billion resulting from potential risk of loss from a major earthquake in california 
bhrg  as a matter of general practice  does not cede catastrophe and individual risks to other reinsurers 
the timing and magnitude of such losses may produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results 
nevertheless  berkshire s management remains willing to accept such volatility provided there is a reasonable prospect of long term underwriting profitability 
retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies for losses arising under insurance or reinsurance contracts written in the past  often many years ago 
while contract terms vary  losses under the contracts are subject to a very large aggregate dollar limit  occasionally exceeding billion under a single contract 
generally  it is also anticipated  although not assured  that claims under retroactive contracts will be paid over long time periods 
these contracts do not produce an immediate underwriting loss for financial reporting purposes 
the excess of the estimated ultimate claims payable over the premiums received is established as a deferred charge which is subsequently amortized over the expected claim settlement periods 
such amortization is included as a component of losses incurred 
underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance are primarily attributed to the amortization of deferred charges established on retroactive reinsurance contracts 
deferred charges  which represent the difference between the policy premium and the estimated ultimate claim reserves  are amortized over the expected claim payment period using the interest method 
the timing and amount of expected future losses are re estimated periodically 
deferred charge balances are adjusted accordingly on a retrospective basis via a cumulative adjustment 
gross loss reserves established under retroactive reinsurance totaled approximately billion as of december  and losses paid during the year totaled approximately million 
unamortized deferred charges at december  totaled approximately billion compared to approximately billion as of december  management believes that these charges are reasonable relative to the large amount of float generated from these policies 
income generated from the investment of float is reflected in investment income and investment gains 
premiums earned in from traditional multi line reinsurance decreased million compared to the comparative decrease was primarily due to declines in quota share participations including lloyd s and the termination of a major quota share contract in mid several contracts were not renewed or were curtailed in so further premium declines are anticipated in pre tax underwriting results in included losses of approximately million arising from the third quarter hurricanes affecting the united states and caribbean 
however  these losses were more than offset by increased underwriting gains in aviation coverages and approximately million in gains from the commutations of several reinsurance contracts in underwriting gains in reflected low amounts of property and aviation losses 
there were no significant commutations in berkshire hathaway primary group berkshire s primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of smaller insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts 
these businesses include national indemnity company s primary group operation nico primary group  a writer of motor vehicle and general liability coverages  us investment corporation usic  
table of contents insurance underwriting continued berkshire hathaway primary group continued whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages  a group of companies referred to internally as homestate operations  providers of standard multi line insurance  and central states indemnity company  a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions 
collectively  berkshire s other primary insurance businesses produced earned premiums of  million in   million in  and million in the increases in premiums earned during the past two years were largely attributed to increased volume of usic and the nico primary group 
net underwriting gains of berkshire s other primary insurance businesses totaled million in  million in and million in the improvement in year to year comparative underwriting results was due to the aforementioned increases in premiums and better than expected claim experience

investment income before taxes applicable income taxes and minority interests investment income after taxes and minority interests pre tax investment income earned by berkshire s insurance businesses in totaled  million  a decrease of from the decline reflects increased amounts invested in low yielding cash and cash equivalents in as well as a reduction in amounts invested in high yield corporate obligations 
in the second half of  short term interest rates in the united states increased  which should result in increased earnings from such investments in periods when compared to periods 
management continues to seek to invest cash balances into long term instruments  including business acquisitions 
however  absent such opportunities  investment income may remain relatively low 
berkshire s management believes that this current strategy  while potentially hurting current earnings  is appropriate in preserving capital and maintaining flexibility to make significant acquisitions when opportunities arise

revenues pre tax earnings loss apparel building products finance and financial products flight services mclane company retail shaw industries other businesses in  berkshire adopted the provisions of eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
as a result  for consolidated reporting purposes  the method of recognizing revenue related to netjets fractional aircraft sales was changed 
management continues to evaluate the results of netjets under the prior revenue recognition criteria and thus has shown revenues and pre tax earnings for the flight services segment using the prior revenue recognition method 
the prior revenue recognition method results in the revenues and pre tax earnings in this table being million greater and million greater than the amounts reported in berkshire s consolidated financial statements 
apparel apparel revenues in totaled  million  an increase of million over increased sales by fruit of the loom fol accounted for essentially all of the increase  as unit sales increased  offset partially by lower net selling prices 
fol generated approximately of total apparel group revenues in pre tax earnings of apparel businesses totaled million in  an increase of over about half of the increase in pre tax earnings was generated by fol due to the aforementioned unit sales increase  although lower net selling prices and higher cotton costs resulted in a decrease in fol s gross margin rate 
in addition  increased earnings were achieved in the footwear businesses hh brown and justin and children s apparel garan  which benefited from increased sales as well as expense controls 
the increases in sales and pre tax earnings in over were due largely to acquisitions of fol april and garan september 
building products building products revenues in totaled  million  an increase of million over increased sales volume was generated in all significant product lines in  including insulation and roofing products  paint  brick and masonry and steel connector plates and truss components  which also reflected higher selling prices 
favorable housing construction markets in the us continued in  which benefited the group as a whole 
pre tax earnings of the building products group in exceeded earnings in by million  reflecting increased pre tax earnings from insulation products and connector plate truss components 
in addition  the results for of the insulation business included a loss of million from a fire at a pipe insulation plant 
eliminating the impact of the fire loss reduces the earnings increase to about 
over the past year  certain production costs such as steel  petroleum based materials  and energy  such as natural gas have risen significantly 
for instance  the cost of steel used in manufacturing connector plates and trusses has risen about over the past year 
also  average prices for natural gas used in manufacturing fiberglass and bricks and gasoline delivery costs have risen significantly over the past year 
such rapid increases produced declines in profit margins  which accelerated during the last half of revenues and pre tax earnings of the building products group in and benefited from the favorable residential housing construction markets 

table of contents non insurance businesses continued finance and financial products revenues generated by the finance and financial products group in totaled  million  an increase of over revenues in include clayton homes for the full year 
clayton was acquired by berkshire on august  and its results are included in berkshire s consolidated financial statements beginning as of that date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this acquisition 
clayton generated total revenues of approximately  million in compared to million in excluding clayton  finance revenues in declined million from life insurance annuity premiums of million were earned in the last half of from a few sizable transactions 
annuity premiums generated in were nominal 
the comparative declines in revenues also reflect lower interest income  resulting from lower amounts of invested assets associated with leveraged investing activities  including reduced interest from berkadia s loan to finova  and higher proportions of low yielding short term investments to total invested assets 
somewhat offsetting the decline was the fact that value capital was consolidated during the first half of see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding value capital 
pre tax earnings from finance and financial products businesses  excluding investment gains losses  in were million  a decrease of million from pre tax earnings reflect the inclusion of clayton for the full year of as well as much improved earnings from leasing businesses cort and xtra 
in  the leasing businesses generated pre tax earnings of million compared to million in in addition  the net loss from the run off of general re s finance business was reduced by million in pre tax earnings from leveraged investing activities declined approximately million in as a result of comparatively lower amounts of invested assets 
in addition  pre tax earnings for of the life annuity insurance business declined approximately million as a result of higher allocations of investments in cash and cash equivalents  a significant reduction in the early redemption of fixed income securities purchased at a discount and adverse changes in mortality assumptions 
flight services flight service revenues increased million over over of the revenue increase resulted from the netjets business where flight operations revenue increased just under million and revenues from aircraft sales increased about million 
the increase in flight operations revenue was primarily due to higher usage  a larger percentage of hours being on larger aircraft and a slight rate increase 
sales of fractional aircraft increased due to an approximately increase in aircraft sold and a higher percentage of sales being large cabin aircraft which carry a higher sales price 
in  revenues from flightsafety increased about million over the prior year 
increased revenues from simulator sales represent about of the increase with increased training revenues accounting for the remainder 
increased training revenues in were attributed to a increase in simulator usage  primarily from corporate aviation and regional airline customers  offset by reduced revenues from government customers 
pre tax earnings of flight services businesses totaled million in  an increase of million as compared to about half of this increase is due to reduced write downs of certain simulators and aircraft inventory 
during  such write downs were about million and during they were about million 
pre tax earnings from flightsafety s training business  excluding asset write downs  increased about million due to the aforementioned revenue increases 
pre tax earnings from netjets flight operations business  excluding asset write downs  improved by about million 
operating results of the flight services business have improved gradually since these businesses were adversely affected by the attack on the world trade center and the deterioration in the us economy that followed 
revenues and pre tax earnings of this segment in declined in comparison with mclane company on may   berkshire acquired mclane company  inc  a distributor of grocery and food products to retailers  convenience stores and restaurants

retail berkshire s principal retail operations consist of home furnishings and jewelry retailers 
total revenues attributed to retail operations were billion in and billion in same store sales in increased from pre tax earnings of the retail group totaled million in compared to million in the increase in sales was substantially offset by higher costs associated with new home furnishings stores  including increased salaries and benefits  depreciation  and distribution costs 

table of contents management s discussion continued non insurance businesses continued shaw industries floor covering sales generated by shaw industries totaled billion in  an increase of million over the increase in revenues was driven by an approximate increase in square yards of carpet sold  higher net selling prices and increased hard surface and rug sales 
sales in include those of two businesses acquired by shaw georgia tufters and the north georgia operations of the dixie group in  which contributed sales of million in and million in pre tax earnings in totaled million  an increase of million over during  petroleum based raw material costs increased on several occasions 
production cost inflation was driven by higher petroleum based raw material and energy related costs 
sales price increases have lagged raw material supplier price increases resulting in a decline in gross sales margins during further margin declines in are possible 
equity in earnings of midamerican energy holdings company earnings from midamerican represent berkshire s share of midamerican s net earnings  as determined under the equity method

investment gains losses investment gains and losses arise when investments are sold and foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market with a corresponding gain or loss included in earnings 
investment gains and losses also arise in connection with investments by berkshire in life settlement contracts 
investment losses can also arise when available for sale or held to maturity securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired otti 
a summary of investment gains and losses follows 
dollar amounts are in millions 
investment gains losses from sales of investments insurance and other finance and financial products otti securities foreign currency forward contracts life settlement contracts other investment gains before income taxes and minority interests income taxes and minority interests net investment gains prior to january   berkshire accounted for investments in life settlement contracts on the cost basis 
therefore  the cost of the investment included the initial purchase price plus periodic maintenance costs 
beginning in  as a result of obtaining information which suggested that the sec believed that a different accounting method should be used  these investments are being accounted for under fasb technical bulletin ftb accounting for purchases of life insurance 
under ftb  the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the contract 
cash paid to purchase these contracts that is in excess of the cash surrender value at the date of purchase is recognized as a loss immediately and periodic maintenance costs  such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying policy in force  are charged to earnings immediately 
the life insurance benefits are payable to the company 
the loss during included million related to life settlement contracts held at december  despite the accounting loss recorded for these contracts  management views these contracts to have a current value no less than the cost paid for the policies plus any subsequent maintenance costs and believes these contracts will produce satisfactory earnings 
gains and losses from foreign currency contracts arise as the value of the us dollar changes against certain foreign currencies 
small changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates can produce material changes in the fair value of these contracts given the large net notional value of berkshire s open contracts billion as of december  and consequently  may produce exceptional volatility in reported earnings in a given period

in february  the remaining balance of berkadia s bank borrowing million was repaid upon the collection of the final million loan to finova and in the second quarter grs repaid debt of approximately million 
berkshire believes that it currently maintains sufficient liquidity to cover its existing contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity 
contractual obligations a summary of long term contractual obligations as of december  follows

table of contents management s discussion continued contractual obligations continued berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities  which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods 
notes payable and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected in the consolidated financial statements along with accrued but unpaid interest as of the balance sheet date 
in addition  berkshire will be obligated to pay interest under debt obligations for periods subsequent to the balance sheet date 
although certain principal balances may be prepaid in advance of the maturity date  which could reduce future interest obligations  it is assumed that no principal prepayments will occur for purposes of this disclosure 
further  while short term borrowings and repurchase agreements are currently expected to be renewed as they mature  such amounts are not assumed to renew for purposes of this disclosure 
berkshire and subsidiaries are also parties to long term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future  which are not currently reflected in the financial statements 
such obligations  including future minimum rentals under operating leases  will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided 
amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date 
contractual obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates 
the timing and amount of such payments is contingent upon the ultimate outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years 
the amounts presented in the preceding table are based upon past claim settlement activities 
the timing and amount of such payments are subject to significant estimation error 
the factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding berkshire s critical accounting policies 
accordingly  the actual timing and amount of payments may differ materially from the amounts shown in the table 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future 
amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty 
accordingly  the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available 
property and casualty losses a summary of berkshire s consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below

depending on the type of loss being estimated  the timing and amount of property and casualty loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent  among other things  upon the timing of the claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process 
a variety of techniques are used to establish and review the liabilities for unpaid losses recorded as of the balance sheet date 
while techniques may vary  significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amount payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred 
as of any balance sheet date  claims that have occurred have not all been reported  and if reported may not have been settled 
the time period between the occurrence date and payment date of a loss is referred to as the claim tail 
property claims usually have fairly short claim tails and  absent litigation  are reported and settled within no more than a few years after 
table of contents property and casualty losses continued occurrence 
casualty losses usually have very long claim tails  occasionally extending for decades 
casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment  which contributes to extended claim tails 
claim tails for reinsurers may be further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices 
the loss and loss expense reserves include provisions for those claims that have been reported referred to as case reserves and for those claims that have not been reported  referred to as incurred but not yet reported ibnr reserves 
receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to other reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and  therefore  are also subject to estimation error 
in addition to the factors cited above  reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders 
each of berkshire s significant insurance operations including geico  general re and bhrg utilize techniques for establishing reserves that are believed to best fit the business 
additional information regarding reserves established by each of the significant businesses follows 
geico geico s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of december  totaled  million and net of reinsurance recoverable were  million 
as of december   gross reserves included  million of case reserves and  million of ibnr reserves 
geico predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim tail 
accordingly  the risk of estimation error is thought to be much less at geico than for either general re or bhrg 
the key assumptions affecting geico s reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts and average loss per claim severity  which includes loss adjustment expenses 
geico s reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims or a ground up approach  which in the aggregate yields a point estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
ranges of loss estimates are not calculated in the aggregate 
a detailed discussion of the process and significant factors considered in establishing reserves follows 
actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard statistical loss development methods and techniques 
the significant reserve components and percentage of gross reserves are average reserves  case and case development reserves  and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims 
such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns 
data is analyzed by policy coverage  jurisdiction of loss  reporting date and occurrence date  among other factors 
a brief discussion of each component follows 
average reserve amounts are established for property claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve 
average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened 
the average severity per claim amount is projected each accident quarter  reflecting both reported claims and unreported claims 
claim adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated 
case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim  including expenses 
individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known 
for most liability coverages  case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim tail  the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the claim is first reported 
therefore  additional case development reserve estimates are established  usually as a percentage of the case reserve 
in general  case development factors are selected by historical statistical analysis  which includes incurred case loss analysis for groups of claims from period to period projected to future dates and amounts or age to age techniques when substantially all of the claims are expected to be settled 
case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically based upon trends in loss development patterns 
for unreported claims  ibnr reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts  to develop age to age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter 
reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims 
the number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the ibnr reserve amount 
actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations  such as to new legal precedents  class action suits  long term claimants from personal injury protection coverages or recent catastrophes 
consequently  supplemental ibnr reserves for these types of events may be established 

table of contents management s discussion continued property and casualty losses continued geico continued for each of its major coverages  geico tests the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models  paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles 
each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period over intervals of time until substantially all of the expected claims have been settled 
geico s exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from to remaining reserves associated with such exposure is currently a relatively insignificant component of geico s total reserves and there is little if any apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure 
related claim activity over the past year was insignificant 
general re general re s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  are summarized below 
amounts are in millions 
workers property compensation casualty total reported case reserves ibnr reserves gross reserves ceded reserves and deferred charges net reserves general re s process of establishing loss reserve estimates is based upon a ground up approach  beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves acr s and ibnr reserves 
critical judgments in the establishment of these loss reserves involve the establishment of acr s by claim examiners  the expectation of ultimate loss ratios  which drive ibnr reserve amounts and the case reserve reporting trends compared to the expected loss reporting patterns 
actuaries do not routinely calculate loss reserve ranges  because it is currently believed that the mathematics of determining ranges has not been sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required  render such resulting range to be unreliable 
in addition  counts of claims or average amount per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail 
general re claim examiners establish case reserve estimates based on the facts and circumstances of the claims and the terms and provisions of the insurance and reinsurance contracts 
for reinsurance claims  claim examiners receive notices from client companies in a manner that reflects the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
contract terms governing claim reporting are generally based on the client s view of the case loss eg  claims with reserves greater than one half the retention or injury type eg  any claim arising from a fatality 
some reinsurance contracts permit claims to be reported on a bulk basis 
bulk reporting provisions generally apply to quota share reinsurance contracts 
upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company  claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts 
in some cases  examiners estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies 
if the examiners estimates are significantly greater than the ceding company s estimates  the claims are further investigated 
if deemed appropriate  acr s are established above the amount reported by the ceding company 
examiners also conduct claim reviews at client companies periodically and case reserves are often increased as a result 
in  claim examiners conducted in excess of claim reviews 
actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments reserve cells primarily based on product eg  treaty  facultative  and program and line of business eg  auto liability  property  eg for each reserve cell  losses are aggregated by accident year and analyzed over time 
depending on client reporting practices  some losses and premiums are aggregated by policy year 
these loss aggregations are called loss triangles  which are the primary basis for ibnr reserve calculations 
north american operations presently review over reserve cells and the international operations presently review about reserve cells 
loss triangles are used to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns and  in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year  are further used to determine ibnr reserves 
certain calculations are performed and form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern 
the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process 
in instances where the historical loss data is insufficient  estimation formulas are used along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment 
factors affecting loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following changing client claims practices  changes in claim examiners use of acr s or the frequency of client company claim reviews  changes in the mix of policy terms and coverage such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits  changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses  as well as other sources of statistical variability 
these items influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns 

table of contents general re continued expected loss ratios are selected by reserve cell  by accident year  based upon reviewing indicated ultimate loss ratios predicted from aggregated pricing statistics 
indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern  reported losses and earned premium 
if the selected emergence pattern is not accurate  then the indicated ultimate loss ratios will not be correct and this can influence the selected loss ratios and hence the ibnr reserve 
as with selected loss emergence patterns  selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios 
ibnr reserves are estimated by reserve cell  by accident year  using the expected loss emergence pattern and the expected loss ratios 
the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical ibnr reserving assumptions and are generally updated every year end 
once the year end ibnr reserves are determined  actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year 
this calculation does not involve new assumptions and uses the prior year end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios 
the expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year 
this comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year end ibnr reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing ibnr reserve assumptions during the course of the year 
in certain reserve cells excess directors and officers and errors and omissions ibnr reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses  without consideration of expected emergence patterns 
these cells typically involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern as has been experienced from the recent wave of corporate scandals that have caused an increase in reported losses 
overall industry wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability  such as in setting the estimates for asbestos and hazardous waste claims 
unpaid environmental  asbestos and mass tort reserves at december  were approximately billion gross and billion net of reinsurance 
such reserves were approximately billion gross and billion net of reinsurance as of december  claims paid attributable to such losses were about million in bhrg bhrg s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  are summarized as follows 
amounts are in millions 
property casualty total reported case reserves ibnr reserves retroactive gross reserves ceded reserves and deferred charges net reserves as of december   bhrg s gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were attributed to casualty losses 
retroactive policies include excess of loss contracts  in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified as well as contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the effective date 
retroactive losses paid in totaled million 
the classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies  who may have inconsistent definitions of case reserves 
reserves are reviewed and established in the aggregate including provisions for ibnr reserves 
in establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves  historical aggregate loss payment patterns are analyzed and projected into the future under various scenarios 
the claim tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades 
management attributes judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined 
due to contractual limits of indemnification  maximum unpaid losses under retroactive policies approximated billion as of december  management cannot reasonably estimate the low end of the retroactive reserve range given the nature of the liabilities assumed 
bhrg s liabilities for environmental  asbestos  and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently believed to be concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts 
reserves for such losses were approximately billion at december  and billion at december  claims paid in attributable to such losses were approximately million 
bhrg  as a reinsurer  does not regularly receive reliable information regarding numbers of asbestos  environmental and latent injury claims from ceding companies on a consistent basis  particularly with respect to multi line treaty or aggregate excess of loss policies 
bhrg s other property and casualty loss reserves derive from catastrophe  individual risk and multi line reinsurance policies 
reserve amounts are based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and ibnr reserves  which are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis supplemented by management s judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known 
anticipated loss ratios are based upon management s judgment considering the type of business covered  analysis of each ceding company s loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company  which are in turn ceded to bhrg 
a range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared 

table of contents management s discussion continued other critical accounting policies berkshire records as assets deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts 
at the inception of these contracts the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses 
no net gain or loss is recognized at the inception of the contract 
deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period and are reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses 
the deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments 
adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract 
unamortized deferred charges totaled billion at december  significant changes in either the timing or ultimate amount of loss payments may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization 
berkshire s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately billion 
these amounts have been recorded as a result of berkshire s numerous prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method 
prior to  goodwill from each acquisition was generally amortized as a charge to earnings over periods not exceeding years 
under sfas no 
 which was adopted by berkshire as of january   periodic amortization ceased  in favor of an impairment only accounting model 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of berkshire s reporting units 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
there are several methods of estimating a reporting unit s fair value  including market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted projected net earnings and multiples of earnings 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value  then individual assets  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value 
the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill 
the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss 
berkshire s consolidated financial position reflects large amounts of invested assets 
a substantial portion of these assets are carried at fair values based upon current market quotations and  when not available  based upon fair value pricing models 
certain fixed maturity securities berkshire owns are not actively traded in the markets 
further  berkshire s finance businesses maintain significant balances of finance receivables  which are carried at amortized cost 
considerable judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in certain pricing models  including interest rate  loan prepayment speed  credit risk and liquidity risk assumptions 
significant changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on carrying values 
information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective is included in note r to the consolidated financial statements 
as indicated in note r to the consolidated financial statements  berkshire does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on its financial statements 
market risk disclosures berkshire s consolidated balance sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
berkshire s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity prices and to a lesser degree derivatives 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with berkshire s business activities 
interest rate risk berkshire s management prefers to invest in equity securities or to acquire entire businesses based upon the principles discussed in the following section on equity price risk 
when unable to do so  management may alternatively invest in bonds  loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments 
berkshire s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk 
management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur 
berkshire has historically utilized a modest level of corporate borrowings and debt 
further  berkshire strives to maintain the highest credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized 
berkshire utilizes derivative products to manage interest rate risks to a very limited degree 
the fair values of berkshire s fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table

includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
equity price risk strategically  berkshire strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management and at sensible prices 
berkshire s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee 
accordingly  berkshire s equity investments are concentrated in relatively few investees 
at december   of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees 
berkshire s preferred strategy is to hold equity investments for very long periods of time 
thus  berkshire management is not necessarily troubled by short term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the table below summarizes berkshire s equity price risks as of december  and and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and a decrease in market prices as of those dates 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in berkshire s equity investment portfolio

table of contents management s discussion continued foreign currency risk berkshire s market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are concentrated primarily in a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts 
generally  these contracts provide that berkshire receive certain foreign currencies and pay us dollars at specified exchange rates and at specified future dates 
management entered into these contracts as a partial economic hedge of the adverse effect from a decline in the value of the us dollar on its net us dollar based assets 
the value of these contracts changes daily due primarily to changes in the spot exchange rates and to a lesser degree  interest rates and time value 
the average duration of the contracts is approximately six months 
the aggregate notional value of such contracts  which are spread among currencies at december   was approximately billion compared to about billion as of december  the fair value asset of these contracts totaled approximately  million at december  and million at december  berkshire monitors the currency positions daily for each currency 
the following table summarizes the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of december  and and shows the estimated changes in values of the contracts assuming changes in the underlying exchange rates applied immediately and uniformly across all currencies 
the changes in value do not necessarily reflect the best or worst case results and therefore  actual results may differ

effective january  grs commenced the run off of its business 
it is expected that the run off will take several years to complete 
since january  approximately of grs s contracts have terminated 
accordingly  derivatives market risks from the grs portfolio declined substantially 
while grs may incur losses to unwind its remaining positions  market risks in the portfolio of derivatives at december  have declined significantly and as of december  management believes that market risks are no longer significant 
however  credit risks from the potential inability of counterparties to settle amounts due to grs remains 
management monitors counterparty credit constantly and contracts may require such exposures to be collateralized 
uncollateralized credit exposure as of december  totaled billion 
no significant credit losses have occurred to date
