item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net income for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal  and a loss of million in fiscal reasons for the improvement in our results are described in more detail in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this item however  some of the key factors that impacted this improvement are summarized as follows sales trends 
our revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal was 
factors effecting our growth are discussed more thoroughly in the results of operations section of this item compared to the prior year  our revenue grew and in the first and second quarters  respectively  was flat in the third quarter and declined in the fourth quarter 
a significant factor negatively effecting our revenue as the year progressed was the continuing penetration of mail order prescription programs  particularly the mandatory mail program that the united auto workers implemented between january and june additionally  our revenue growth was negatively effected by the difficult comparisons to prior year revenues for our stores in southern california that benefited from the effects of a strike at several southern california grocery chains that lasted from october until february as described in the strategy section of item of this form k  we are taking steps to address this declining revenue trend by working to increase sales at our existing stores through improved customer service and developing new stores in our strongest markets 
we also believe that the introduction of a day mail option through our pbm capabilities will have a positive impact on our revenue trend 
however  we expect our revenue results to continue to face significant pressures from the existing competitive environment 
income tax valuation allowance adjustment 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based upon a review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we can generate sustainable consolidated net income for the foreseeable future  we now believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these net deferred tax assets will be utilitzed 
based upon our expectation of future utilization  we have reduced a portion of our valuation allowance at year end resulting in a non cash increase in net income of million during fiscal an additional reduction in the valuation allowance of million was recorded as additional paid in capital in fiscal to reflect the tax benefit associated with previously recorded stock based compensation 
we will continue to monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
to the extent that it becomes more likely than not that those net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would be required to reverse all or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of billion against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end debt refinancing and receivables securitization 
in fiscal and in fiscal  we took several steps to improve our leverage and extend the terms of a substantial amount of our debt 
in fiscal  we replaced our senior secured credit facility with a new credit facility  entered into receivable securitization agreements  issued new senior secured notes  and repurchased portions of several existing notes prior to maturity 
as a result of entering into the new senior secured credit facility and the receivables securitization agreements  we recorded a loss on debt modifications of million  offset by net gains of million related to the note repurchases described above 
in fiscal  we replaced our then existing senior secured credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility  issued new senior notes  and repurchased portions of several existing notes prior to maturity 
these activities resulted in a loss of million related to the termination of the old senior secured credit facility and the issuance of the new senior secured credit facility  offset by net gains of million related to the note repurchases described above 
these steps have enabled us to reduce our debt from billion as of march  to billion as of february   and to extend the maturity of the majority of our debt to and beyond 
these transactions are discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
dilutive equity issuances 
at february   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible notes and preferred stock 
our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consist of the following

b the conversion of these notes to equity would reduce the principal amount of debt by million working capital 
we generally finance our inventory and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds  funds generated from our securitization facility  funds generated from sale leaseback transactions and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
we expect to use cash from operating activities  proceeds from our securitization facility and  when necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance inventories and to support our continued growth 
the majority of our front end sales are in cash 
third party payors  which typically settle in fewer than days  accounted for of our pharmacy sales and of our revenues in fiscal industry trends 
we believe pharmacy sales in the united states will increase at least over the next three years based upon studies published by pharmacy benefit management companies and a pharmaceutical market intelligence firm 
this rate of increase is lower than it has been in the past five years 
the anticipated increase of over the next three years is expected to be driven by the baby boom generation entering their fifties  the increasing life expectancy of the american population  the new medicare endorsed prescription program  the introduction of several new drugs and the rate of inflation 
the retail drugstore industry is highly competitive and has been experiencing consolidation 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry  continued new store openings  increased mail order and drug importation will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
in addition  sales of potential generic pharmaceuticals continue to grow as a percentage of total prescription drug sales  which has a dampening effect on sales growth 
the growth rate of prescription drug sales has also been impacted by slower introductions of successful new prescription drugs and safety concerns related to recalls of prescription medications  such as the recent antiarthritic drug recalls 
the retail drugstore industry relies significantly on third party payors at an increasing rate 
third party payors  especially state sponsored medicaid agencies  have recently evaluated and reduced certain reimbursement levels 
also  modifications to the medicare program will expand coverage of prescription drugs 
if third party payors  including state sponsored medicaid agencies  reduce their reimbursement levels  or if medicare covers prescription drugs at lower reimbursement levels  sales and margins in the industry could be reduced  and profitability of the industry could be adversely affected

revenues fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by pharmacy sales growth of  and front end sales growth of 
sales growth in both pharmacy and front end was driven by increases in same store sales  which are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below 
we include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocated stores are included in same store sales 
fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased by  due to increases in price per prescription 
the increase in price per prescription is due to inflation  offset by an increase in generic sales and lower reimbursement rates 
offsetting the increase in price per prescription was a decrease in the number of prescriptions filled 
this reduction is due primarily to certain third party payors requiring or encouraging customers to use mail order  safety concerns in hormone therapy  psychotherapeutic and antiarthritic prescriptions  the movement of certain prescription drugs to over the counter and a milder cold and flu season than in the prior year 
we expect the negative impact from mail order activity to continue for the foreseeable future 
the lower rate of increase in fiscal is also partially attributable to our southern california stores benefiting from an increase in business in fiscal related to a union strike at several grocery store chains 
fiscal front end same store sales increased  primarily as a result of improvement in our consumable over the counter and health and beauty care categories  partially offset by a decrease in photo and film sales  sales decreases in categories negatively impacted by a milder cold and flu season and decreased traffic in stores that were negatively impacted by mail order programs 
the lower rate of increase in fiscal is also partially attributable to our southern california stores benefiting from an increase in business in fiscal related to a union strike at several grocery store chains 
fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by pharmacy sales growth of and front end sales growth 
sales growth in both pharmacy and front end was driven by same store sales which are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below 
fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased by due primarily to increases in price per prescription and  to a lesser extent  increases in the number of prescriptions filled 
the increase in price per prescription was driven by inflation  partially offset by an increase in generic sales mix 
the increase in the number of prescriptions filled was aided by prescription file purchases  a more severe flu season and favorable industry trends 
favorable industry trends include an aging population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems  and the introduction of a number of successful prescription drugs 
partially offsetting increases in the number of prescriptions filled was an increase in third party payors requiring customers to use mail order for certain prescriptions and a reduction in hormone replacement and non sedating antihistamine prescriptions 
fiscal front end same store sales increased by  primarily as a result of improvements in core categories  such as over the counter items  consumables and vitamins and improved assortments 
also contributing to front end same store sales increases was the switch of certain drugs from prescription to over the counter products 
pharmacy and front end same store sales increases in fiscal benefited from increased business in southern california stores  driven by the migration of customers impacted by a union strike at several grocery store chains 
the union strike ended in the beginning of march the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by pharmacy sales growth of  offset slightly by front end sales decline of 
the decline in front end sales was a direct result of closing stores in fiscal  partially offset by same store sales growth of 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased by  due to increases in both the number of prescriptions filled and sales price per prescription 
factors contributing to our pharmacy same store sales increases include inflation  improved attraction and retention of managed care customers  our increased focus on pharmacy initiatives  such as predictive refill  and favorable industry trends 
these favorable factors were partially offset by the increase in generic sales mix  a reduction in hormone replacement therapy prescriptions and the impact of a less severe flu season than in the prior year 
fiscal front end same store sales increased  primarily as a result of improvement in most core categories  such as over the counter items  consumables and vitamins  and improved assortments

cost of goods sold gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin was positively impacted by improvements in pharmacy margin  which was driven by improved generic product mix and reduced inventory costs resulting from purchasing improvements 
these items were partially offset by lower reimbursement rates 
gross margin was also positively impacted by the recording of a lifo credit in fiscal  which resulted from a decrease in the pricing indices caused by generic drug deflation 
partially offsetting these items was a decrease in front end margin  which was caused by increased markdowns and a decrease in one hour photo margins

overall gross margin was also positively impacted by lower occupancy and depreciation and amortization charges

impairment charges in fiscal  and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the impairment of long lived assets at  and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were assessed for impairment as part of our on going review of the performance of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close the store 
store and equipment lease exit charges credits in fiscal  and  we recorded charges for  and stores  respectively  to be closed or relocated under long term leases 
effective january   charges to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  were recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities 
prior to january   charges incurred to close a store were recorded at the time management committed to closing the store 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
this liability is discounted using a risk free rate of interest 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
the effect of adjustments to the risk free rate of interest and the reversal of reserves established for stores that were previously committed for closure by management  but ultimately were not closed  resulted in a net credit for fiscal as part of our ongoing business activities  we will continue to assess stores for potential closure 
there can be no assurance that other such actions may not be required in the future  or that such actions would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period in which we take those actions 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to the lower outstanding balance and lower interest rate on our senior secured credit facility resulting from the fiscal refinancing 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to a decrease in debt issue cost amortization and reclassification of closed store interest expense  which pursuant to sfas no 
 is classified as a component of store closing and impairment charges 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were   and respectively 
interest rate swap contracts we entered into two year interest rate swap contracts in june and july of to hedge the exposure to increasing rates with respect to our variable rate debt 
as a result of the june refinancing  the interest rate swap contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment  and therefore the changes in fair value of these interest rate swap contracts were required to be recorded as components of net loss 
changes in market value of the interest rate swaps in fiscal were not significant 
these contracts expired and were fully funded during fiscal and have not been renewed 
income taxes income tax benefits of million  million and million have been recorded for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal benefit was comprised of a tax benefit of million offset by tax expense of million consisting primarily of state income taxes 
the fiscal benefit was principally the result of a reduction of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets that were previously fully reserved 
the fiscal benefit was comprised of a federal tax benefit of million and state tax expense of million 
the federal tax benefit was related to the conclusion of the internal revenue service examination for fiscal years through  representing recoverable federal and state income taxes and interest  as well as a reduction of previously recorded liabilities 
the state tax expense of million was the result of the provision from operations for state income taxes for which the use of net operating losses nols was temporarily suspended by certain jurisdictions 
the fiscal benefit resulted primarily from a federal tax law change that increased the carry back period of net operating losses incurred in fiscal and from two to five years 
generally accepted accounting principles require that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based upon a review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we can generate sustainable consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future  we now believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these net deferred tax assets will be utilized 
based upon our expectation of future utilization  we have reduced a portion of our valuation allowance at year end resulting in a non cash tax benefit of million during fiscal an additional reduction in the valuation allowance of million was recorded as additional paid in capital in fiscal to reflect the tax benefit associated with previously recorded stock based compensation 
we will continue to monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets and continue to maintain a valuation allowance of billion against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end beginning in fiscal  we expect to record income tax expense on forecast earnings at an effective rate of to 
however  as of february   we had approximately billion of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
accordingly  we expect to pay minimal taxes for the forseeable future 
should these operating loss carryforwards be utilized  we may be required to reverse all or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance 
the company underwent an ownership change for statutory tax purposes during fiscal  which resulted in a limitation on the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
this limitation was considered when determining the required level for the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources general we have five primary sources of liquidity i cash equivalent investments  ii cash provided by operating activities  iii the sale of accounts receivable under our receivable securitization agreements  iv the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility  and v sale leasebacks of owned property 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to provide funds for capital expenditures and to provide funds for payment and repurchase of our debt 
transactions new credit facility on september   we replaced our senior secured credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility 
the new facility consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  and will mature in september  the proceeds of the loans made on the closing date of the new credit facility along with available cash and proceeds from the receivables securitization agreements were used to repay outstanding amounts under the old credit facility 
borrowings under the new facility currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
we are required to pay fees of per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
amortization payments of million related to the new term loan began on november  and will continue on a quarterly basis until may   with a final payment of million due august  substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the new senior secured credit facility 
the subsidiary guarantees are secured by a first priority lien on  among other things  the inventory and prescription files of the subsidiary guarantors 
rite aid corporation is a holding company with no direct operations and is dependent upon dividends  distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to service payment under the new senior secured credit facility 
rite aid corporation s direct obligations under the new senior secured credit facility are unsecured 
the new senior secured credit facility allows for the issuance of up to million in additional term loans or additional revolver availability 
we may request the additional loans at any time prior to the maturity of the senior secured credit facility  provided we are not in default of any terms of the facility  nor are we in violation of any of our financial covenants 
the new senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured subordinated debt in addition to the senior secured credit facility which amount is reduced by any additional unsecured debt that matures prior to december   as described below 
we also have the ability to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt  if the debt does not mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to december  we have the ability to incur additional unsecured debt of up to million with a scheduled maturity of prior to december  the maximum amount of additional secured subordinated debt and unsecured debt with a maturity prior to december  that can be incurred is billion 
at february   remaining additional permitted secured subordinated debt under the new senior secured credit facility is million in addition to what is available under the revolver  however  other debentures do not permit additional secured subordinated debt if the revolver is fully drawn 
the new senior secured credit facility also allows for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity on or before september   and for the repurchase of debt with a maturity after september   if we maintain availability on the revolving credit facility of at least million 
the new senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants  which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above  the payments of dividends  mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens 
the new senior secured credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial covenant ratios  but only if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million 
if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million  the covenants would have required us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of for the twelve months ended february  subsequent to february   the ratio gradually decreases to for the twelve months ending august  in addition  if the availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million  we would have been required to maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio of for the twelve months ended february  subsequent to february   the ratio gradually increases to for the twelve months ending august  the new senior secured credit facility provides for customary events of default  including nonpayments  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of million or if any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity of such debt 
our ability to borrow under the new senior secured credit facility is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of inventory and prescription files 
at february   the term loan was fully drawn and we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at february   we also had letters of credit outstanding against the revolving credit facility of million  which gave us additional borrowing capacity of at february  as a result of the placement of the new senior secured credit facility and the receivable securitization agreements  we recorded a loss on debt modification of million for the year ended february  off balance sheet obligations on september   we entered into receivables securitization agreements with several multi seller asset backed commercial paper vehicles 
under the terms of the securitization agreements  we sell substantially all of our eligible third party pharmaceutical receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity spe and retain servicing responsibility 
the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person  including any of our affiliates 
these agreements provide for us to sell  and for the spe to purchase these receivables  and for the spe to borrow the funds secured by these receivables of up to million 
the amount of receivables funded at any one time is dependent upon a formula that takes into account such factors as default history  obligor concentrations and potential dilution 
adjustments to this amount can occur on a weekly basis 
at february   we retained an interest in the third party pharmaceutical receivables in the form of overcollateralization of million  which is included in accounts receivable  net  on the consolidated balance sheet at allocated cost  which approximates fair value 
proceeds from the initial sale of the receivables were used to repay outstanding amounts under the exisiting senior secured credit facility 
any additional proceeds are used to fund operations 
we paid one time arrangement and marketing fees of million at the closing date  which are recorded as a loss on debt modification 
we must pay an ongoing program fee of approximately libor plus on the amount sold to the spe under the securtization agreements and must pay a liquidity fee of on the daily unused amount under the securitization agreements 
the program and the liquidity fees are recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
rite aid corporation guarantees certain perfomance obligations of its affiliates under the securitization agreements  but does not guarantee the collectibility of the receivables and obligor creditworthiness 
the vehicles that make loans to the spe have a commitment to lend that ends september with the option to annually extend the commitment to purchase 
should any of the vehicles fail to renew their commitment  we have access to a backstop credit facility  which is backed by the entities that make loans to the spe s 
the backstop facility is committed through september sales leaseback transactions during fiscal  we sold the land and buildings on owned stores to several outside entities 
proceeds from these sales totaled million 
we entered into agreements to lease these stores back from the purchasers over minimum lease terms of years 
the leases are being accounted for as operating leases 
gains on these transactions of million have been deferred and are being recorded over the related minimum lease terms 
losses of million  which related to certain stores in these transactions  were recorded as losses on the sale of assets and investments in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended february  preferred stock transactions in the thirteen week period ended february   we issued million shares of series e mandatory convertible preferred stock at an offering price of per share

net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal operating cash flow was positively impacted by improved operating results and net proceeds of million from the sale of certain of our third party receivables  partially offset by an increase in inventory 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  which more than offset increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  income tax refunds of million and decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  which more than offset a decrease in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash of million was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and cash of million was used for the purchase of prescription files 
cash of million was provided by proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions and cash of million was provided by proceeds from other asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash of million was used to purchase land and buildings at our perryman  md and lancaster  ca distribution centers  which had previously been held under a synthetic lease arrangement 
cash of million was used for the purchase of other fixed assets and cash of million was used for the purchase of prescription files 
cash of million was provided by the disposition of fixed assets and other investments 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash of million was used for the purchase of fixed assets and cash of million was used for the purchase of prescription files 
cash of million was provided by the disposition of fixed assets and other investments 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  due to the restructuring of our credit facility and early redemption of several bonds 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal cash usage related to the change in our credit facility  the early redemption of several bonds and payments on certain bonds at maturity was largely offset by proceeds from bond issuances 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal the cash used consisted of the repayments of long term debt and deferred financing fees  offset with proceeds from the issuance of bonds 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million to million during fiscal  consisting of approximately to million related to new store construction  store relocation  store remodel projects and capitalized store repairs  to million related to technology enhancements  improvements to distribution centers  and other corporate requirements  and to million related to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacies 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility available under our senior secured credit facility 
we have resumed the activities of a new store and store relocation program 
in fiscal  our goal is to open or relocate stores 
approximately of the stores will be relocated stores and the remaining will be new stores 
the program is focused on our strongest existing markets 
we also expect to remodel stores in fiscal we believe that this program over the long term  along with the execution of the near term strategy of improving store productivity  will continue to increase our sales and operating profits 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon current levels of operations and planned improvements in our operating performance  management believes that cash flow from operations together with cash equivalent investments  available borrowings under the senior credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated annual requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
obtaining any such supplemental liquidity through the increase of indebtedness or asset sales may require the consent of the lenders under one or more of our debt agreements 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or that our lenders would provide the necessary consents  if required 
recent accounting pronouncements we have several stock option plans 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
effective march   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the modified prospective method of adoption selected by us under the provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
compensation cost recognized in fiscal and is the same as that which would have been recognized had the recognition provisions of sfas no 
been applied from its original effective date 
results for the prior periods have not been restated 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard requires companies to account for share based payments to associates using the fair value method for expense recognition 
this standard is required to be adopted as of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we have not yet adopted sfas no 
r 
however  as we have adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin states that a conditional asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  retrospective application for interim financial information is permitted but not required 
early adoption of fin is encouraged 
we have not quantified the impact of adopting fin  but we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management allowance for uncollectible receivables the majority of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventory included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrink  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates that our reserves are based on  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including stores and excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the store s assets 
cash flows are calculated utilizing individual store forecasts and total company projections for the remaining estimated lease lives of the stores being analyzed 
should actual results differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to these facilities 
goodwill impairment as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our test as of february  resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
self insurance liabilities we record estimates for self insured medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage with assistance from actuaries 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that are calculated under the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are based on market interest rates  and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the accumulated benefit obligation of the defined benefit plans is a discounted amount calculated using the discount rate from published high quality long term bond indices  the term of which approximates the term of the cash flows to pay the accumulated benefit obligations when due 
an increase in the market interest rates  assuming no other changes in the estimates  reduces the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation and the related required expense 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  that are present valued at current risk free interest rates 
anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  and anticipated future subleases of properties 
if interest rates or the real estate leasing markets change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel  and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
factors affecting our future prospects risks related to our financial condition we are highly leveraged 
our substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary 
we had  as of february   billion of outstanding indebtedness not including obligations under the receivables securitization agreements and stockholders equity of million 
we also had additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million at that time  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
our debt obligations adversely affect our operations in a number of ways and while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal year  there can be no assurance that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt  which may require us to borrow additional funds for that purpose  restructure or otherwise refinance our debt 
our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for fiscal was 
our earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges for fiscal by million and by considerably higher amounts prior to fiscal our high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will

spacer

limit our ability to obtain additional financing  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to substantially improve our operating performance  which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which we cannot control 
if our cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient  we may take certain actions  including delaying or reducing capital or other expenditures  attempting to restructure or refinance our debt  selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital 
we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
further  any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business 
our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions 
our failure to earn enough to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us 
borrowings under our senior credit facility and expenses related to the sale of our accounts receivable under our receivables securitization agreements are based upon variable rates of interest  which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness as of february  bears an interest rate that varies depending upon libor 
if we borrow additional amounts under our senior credit facility  the interest rate on those borrowings will also vary depending upon libor 
further  we pay ongoing program fees under our receivables securitization agreements that vary depending upon libor 
if libor rises  the interest rates on outstanding debt and the program fees under our receivables securitization program will increase 
therefore an increase in libor would increase our interest payment obligations under these outstanding loans  increase our receivables securitization program fee payments and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
we currently do not maintain any hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest 
the covenants in our outstanding indebtedness impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
the covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to

in addition  if we have less than million available under our revolving credit facility  we will be subject to certain financial covenant ratios 
if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants  a default could result under one or more of these agreements 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable 
if acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we obtain modifications of our agreements  or are required to obtain waivers of defaults  we may incur significant fees and transaction costs 
in fiscal and the previous four fiscal years  we modified certain covenants contained in our then existing senior credit facility and loan agreements 
in connection with obtaining these modifications  we paid significant fees and transaction costs 
risks related to our operations we need to continue to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition  but our operations will not improve if we cannot continue to effectively implement our business strategy or if our strategy is negatively affected by general economic conditions 
we have not yet achieved the sales productivity level of our major competitors 
we believe that improving the sales of existing stores is important to achieving profitability and continuing to improve operating cash flow 
if we are not successful in implementing our strategy  or if our strategy is not effective  we may not be able to improve our operations 
in addition  any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  which are our higher margin products  and cause a proportionately greater decrease in our profitability 
failure to continue to improve operations or a decline in general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt 
our new store and store relocation development program requires entering construction and development commitments and occasionally purchasing land that will not be utilized for several years which may limit our financial flexibility 
we will enter into significant construction and development commitments as part of our new store and store relocation development program 
also  we will occasionally make capital expenditures to acquire land that may not be used for several years 
even if there are significant negative economic or competitive developments in our industry  financial condition or the regions where we have made these commitments  we are obligated to fulfill these commitments 
further  if we subsequently dispose of the property that we acquire  we may receive less than our purchase price or the net book value of such property  which may result in financial loss 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our executive management team 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial condition or cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal investigations by the united states attorney 
in addition to any fines or damages that we might have to pay  any criminal conviction against us may result in the loss of licenses and contracts that are material to the conduct of our business  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal governmental investigations by the united states attorney involving matters related to prior management s business practices 
settlement discussions have begun with the united states attorney of the middle district of pennsylvania  who has proposed that the government would not institute any criminal proceeding against us if we enter into a consent judgment providing for a civil penalty payable over a period of years 
the amount of the civil penalty has not been agreed to and there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached or that the amount of such penalty will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we recorded an accrual of million in fiscal in connection with the resolution of these matters  however  we may incur charges in excess of that amount and we are unable to estimate the possible range of loss 
we will continue to evaluate our estimate and to the extent that additional information arises or our strategy changes  we will adjust our accrual accordingly 
if we were convicted of any crime  certain licenses and government contracts  such as medicaid plan reimbursement agreements that are material to our operations  may be revoked  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  substantial penalties  damages or other monetary remedies assessed against us could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
a disruption in this relationship may have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we obtain approximately of the dollar value of our prescription drugs from a single supplier  mckesson  pursuant to a contract that runs through march pharmacy sales represented approximately of our total sales during fiscal  and  therefore  our relationship with mckesson is important to us 
any significant disruptions in our relationship with mckesson would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business until we executed a replacement strategy 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to find a replacement supplier on a timely basis or that such supplier would be able to fulfill our demands on similar terms  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
risks related to our industry the markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  discount stores  dollar stores and mail order pharmacies 
our industry also faces growing competition from companies who import drugs directly from other countries  such as canada 
we may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours 
in addition  we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors 
the ability of our stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of customers 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
as competition increases  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur  which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue effectively to compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition 
another adverse trend for drugstore retailing has been initiatives to contain rising healthcare costs leading to the rapid growth in mail order prescription processors 
these prescription distribution methods have grown in market share relative to drugstores as a result of the rapid rise in drug costs experienced in recent years and are predicted to continue to rise 
mail order prescription distribution methods are perceived by employers and insurers as being less costly than traditional distribution methods and are being encouraged  and  in some cases  required  by third party pharmacy benefit managers  employers and unions that administer benefits 
as a result  some labor unions and employers are requiring  and others may encourage or require  that their members or employees obtain medications from mail order pharmacies which offer drug prescriptions at prices lower than we are able to offer 
for example  when we announced our fourth quarter earnings  we disclosed that our sales continued to be negatively impacted by mandatory mail prescription programs  including the united auto workers program 
mail order prescription distribution has negatively affected sales for traditional chain drug retailers  including us  in the last few years and we expect such negative effect to continue in the future 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to offset the effects of mail order will be successful 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales of prescription drugs  as a percentage of sales  and the percentage of prescription sales reimbursed by third parties  have been increasing and we expect them to continue to increase 
in fiscal  sales of prescription drugs represented of our sales and of all of the prescription drugs that we sold were with third party payors 
during fiscal  the top five third party payors accounted for approximately of our total sales  the largest of which represented of our total sales 
any significant loss of third party payor business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
also  these third party payors could reduce the levels at which they will reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  the passing in december of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act will grant a prescription drug benefit to participants 
as a result of this benefit  we may be reimbursed for some prescription drugs at prices lower than our current reimbursement levels 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were from state sponsored medicaid agencies 
there have been a number of recent proposals and enactments by various states to reduce medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget problems  some of which propose to reduce reimbursement levels in the applicable states significantly  and we expect other similar proposals in the future 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare or state medicaid programs cover prescription drugs at lower reimbursement levels  our margins on these sales would be reduced  and the profitability of our business and our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business  the results of our operations or our financial condition 
our pharmacy business is subject to federal  state and local regulation 
these include local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations and prohibitions against paid referrals of patients 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including suspension of payments from government programs  loss of required government certifications  loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs  such as the medicare and medicaid programs  loss of licenses  significant fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations  submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business 
furthermore  our pharmacies could be affected by federal and state reform programs  such as healthcare reform initiatives which could  in turn  negatively affect our business 
the passing of these initiatives or any new federal or state programs could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our pharmacy business is subject to the patient privacy and other obligations including corporate  pharmacy and associate responsibility  imposed by the health insurance portability and accountability act 
as a covered entity  we are required to implement privacy standards  train our associates on the permitted use and disclosures of protected health information  provide a notice of privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy health customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information 
failure to properly adhere to these requirements could result in the imposition of civil as well as criminal penalties 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions adequacy of warnings and unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs 
in addition  federal and state laws that require our pharmacists to offer counseling  without additional charge  to their customers about medication  dosage  delivery systems  common side effects and other information the pharmacists deem significant can impact our business 
our pharmacists may also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  from time to time  claims result in the payment of significant amounts  some portions of which are not funded by insurance 
we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission 
we will not be able to compete effectively if we are unable to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
there is a nationwide shortage of qualified pharmacists 
in response  we have implemented improved competitive benefits and training programs in order to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
we have also expanded our pharmacist recruiting efforts through an increase in the number of recruiters  a successful pharmacist intern program and improved relations with pharmacy schools 
however  we may not be able to attract  hire and retain enough qualified pharmacists 
this could adversely affect our operations 
we may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
products that we sell could become subject to contamination  product tampering  mislabeling or other damage requiring us to recall our private label products 
in addition  errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death 
product liability claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell and we may be obligated to recall our private brand products 
a product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of february

our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings on this facility are libor plus for the term loan and the revolving credit facility 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of as of february  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately million on february a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 
in addition to the financial instruments listed above  the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our receivables securitization agreements are determined based on libor
