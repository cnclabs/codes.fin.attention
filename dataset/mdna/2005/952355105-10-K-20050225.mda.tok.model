critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by securities and exchange commission financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
the communication services segment recognizes revenue for customer initiated  agent based services  including order processing  customer acquisition  customer retention and customer care in the month that calls are answered by an agent based on the number of calls and or minutes received and processed on behalf of clients 
for agent based services that we initiate including order processing  customer acquisition  customer retention and customer care  revenue is recognized on an hourly basis or on a success rate basis in the month that we place calls to consumers on behalf of clients 
automated services revenue is 
table of contents recognized in the month that the calls are received or sent by automated voice response units and is billed based on call duration 
the conferencing services segment recognizes revenue when services are provided and generally consists of per minute charges 
revenues are reported net of any volume or special discounts 
the receivables management segment recognizes contingency fee revenue in the month collection payments are received based upon a percentage of cash collected or other agreed upon contractual parameters 
the acquisition of worldwide on august  resulted in us adopting a critical accounting policy for revenue recognition of purchased receivables 
we believe that the amounts and timing of cash collections for our purchased receivables can be reasonably estimated and therefore  we utilize the effective interest method of accounting for our purchased receivables as set forth in accounting standards executive committee practice bulletin pb 
selection of this revenue recognition policy  versus the cash recovery method  is based on our historical results and our knowledge of the industry 
in accordance with this revenue recognition policy  each pool of receivables is recorded at historical cost and statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
the relevant factors in computing the cash flow are the timing  which typically averages from to months  and amount of cash to be received 
an internal rate of return irr is established for each pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows and applied to the balance of the pool 
the resulting revenue recognized is based on the irr applied to the remaining balance of each pool of accounts 
the effective interest method is used to allocate cash collections between revenue and amortization of the portfolios principal reduction 
revenue is recognized over the period of the purchased receivables anticipated cash flow using the resulting yield 
in the event that cash collected would be inadequate to amortize the carrying value  an impairment charge would be taken 
in the event that cash collected would result in an excess amortization of the carrying value  the irr would be adjusted 
periodically the receivables management segment will sell all or a portion of a pool to third parties 
proceeds of these sales are also recognized in revenue under the effective interest method 
application of pb requires the use of estimates to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than projected cash collections  earnings could be affected either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur earlier than projected cash collections will have a favorable impact on irr  revenues and amortization of portfolios 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected cash collections will have an unfavorable impact on irr  revenues and amortization of portfolios 
for the five months ended december   that worldwide s operations were included in our results  every basis point change in the average amortization rate for all pools would have affected year to date revenue by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable reflects reserves for receivables to reduce receivables and notes receivable to amounts expected to be collected 
management uses significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
while management believes the processes effectively address our exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in the economy  industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of acquisitions made from through  our recorded goodwill as of december  was million and the recorded value of other intangible assets as of december  was million 
two matters arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
in connection with these acquisitions  a third party valuation was performed to assist management in the determination of the purchase price allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase price allocation process requires estimates and judgments as to certain expectations and business strategies 
if the actual results differ from the assumptions and judgments made  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration in amortization expense 
in addition  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
any changes in key assumptions about the businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
stock options 
our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
as allowed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we do not record any compensation expense on the income statement with respect to options granted to employees 
alternatively  under gaap  we could have recorded a compensation expense based on the fair value of employee stock options 
as described in note in the consolidated financial statements  had we recorded a fair value based compensation expense for stock options  diluted earnings per share would have been to less than what we reported for  and income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we recognize current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
as part of the determination of our current tax liability  we exercise considerable judgment in evaluating positions we have taken in our tax returns 
we have established reserves for probable tax exposures 
these reserves  included in current tax liabilities  represent our estimate of amounts expected to be paid  which we adjust over time as more information becomes available 
we also recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences eg  book depreciation versus tax depreciation  eg the calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws or related interpretations  uncertainties related to the outcomes of tax audits and changes in our operations or other facts and circumstances 
further  we must continually monitor changes in these factors 
changes in such factors may result in changes to management estimates and could require us to adjust our tax assets and liabilities and record additional income tax expense or benefits 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r is effective for all interim periods beginning after june  and thus  will be effective for west beginning with the third quarter of early adoption is encouraged and retroactive application of the provisions of sfas r to the beginning of the year that includes the effective date is permitted  but not required 
based on the unvested outstanding options at december   we estimate the effect on net income of adopting sfas r in july will be approximately million 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans of debt securities acquired in a transfer 
this statement of position sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
increases in expected cash flows should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of irr while decreases in expected cash flows should be recognized as an impairment 
the sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively to loans acquired on or before december  as it applies to decreases in expected cash flows 
our preliminary evaluation of the effects of this sop indicate the impact on our results of operations will not be material 

table of contents risk factors an investment in our common stock involves risks 
you should carefully consider the following risks before making an investment decision 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be seriously harmed  in which case the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment 
we face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions 
our growth has been enhanced through acquisitions of other businesses 
we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions 
if we are unable to make appropriate acquisitions on reasonable terms our financial results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and our investors 
in addition  when considering an acquisition  we determine whether such acquisition will allow us to achieve certain objectives including operational synergies  reduced costs and expenses  increased revenues  additional clients  increased market share  new products and capabilities 
to the extent that we are unable to achieve our planned objectives from an acquisition  this may affect our financial results 
we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business 
the united states congress  fcc  ftc and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern the methods and processes of making and completing telephone solicitations and sales and the collection of consumer debt 
we believe that our operating procedures currently comply in all material respects with presently effective provisions of these rules and laws 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would not be subject to agency or state proceedings alleging violation of such rules and laws 
future rules and laws may require us to modify our operations or service offerings in order to effectively meet our clients service requirements  and there can be no assurance that additional regulations would not limit our activities or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
for further discussion of regulatory issues  see item business government regulations 
even if we comply with the rules and laws  the restrictions imposed by such regulations may generally adversely impact our business 
our clients may reduce the volume of business they outsource 
regulations regarding the use of technology  such as restrictions on automated dialers or the required transmittal of caller identification information  may further reduce the efficiency or effectiveness of our operations 
however  we cannot predict the impact state and federal regulations may have on our business or whether such impact may adversely affect or limit our operations 
our clients are also subject to varying degrees of government regulation  particularly in the telecommunications  insurance and financial services industries 
we may be subject to a variety of enforcement or private actions for non compliance or our clients non compliance with such regulations 
there is increasing federal and state interest in privacy protection  some aspects of which could impose additional regulatory pressure on the business of our clients and  less directly  on our business 
such pressures could impact our business if it has the effect of reducing the demand for our services or exposes us to potential liability 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive industries 
we face significant competition in our markets and expect this competition will intensify 
the principal competitive factors in our industries are technological expertise  service quality  sales and marketing skills  the ability to develop and implement customized products and services and the cost of services 
in addition  we believe there has been an industry trend to move agent based operations towards offshore sites 
such movement could result in excess capacity in the united states where most of our current capacity exists 
the trend towards international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuous technological changes may bring new and different competitors into our markets and may erode profits because of reduced prices 
our competitors products and services and pricing practices  as well as the timing and circumstances of the entry of additional competitors into our markets may harm our business 

table of contents our communication services segment s business and growth depends in large part on the industry trend toward outsourcing crm solutions and services 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves 
a significant change in this trend could seriously harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our cross selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single source outsourcing approach 
our conferencing services segment faces competitive pressures as the audio conferencing services industry continues to consolidate in response to pricing pressures and technological advances 
video and web conferencing services continue to develop as new vendors are entering the marketplace offering a broader range of conferencing solutions 
the consumer debt collection industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with a wide range of other purchasers of charged off consumer receivables  third party collection agencies  other financial service companies and credit originators and other owners of debt that manage their own charged off consumer receivables 
some of these companies have substantially greater personnel and financial resources than we do 
furthermore  during the past year some of our competitors have raised substantial amounts of capital  the proceeds from which may be used  at least in part  to fund expansion and to increase their purchases of charged off portfolios 
in addition  companies with greater financial resources than we have may elect in the future to enter the consumer debt collection business 
competitive pressures affect the availability and pricing of receivable portfolios as well as the availability and cost of qualified debt collectors 
we face bidding competition in our acquisition of charged off consumer receivable portfolios 
we believe successful bids generally are awarded based on a combination of price  service and relationships with the debt sellers 
some of our current competitors  and possible new competitors  may have more effective pricing and collection models  greater adaptability to changing market needs and more established relationships in our industry than we have 
moreover  our competitors may elect to pay prices for portfolios that we determine are not reasonable and  in that event  our volume of portfolio purchases may be diminished 
in addition  there continues to be a consolidation of credit card issuers  which have been a principal source of our receivable purchases 
this consolidation has decreased the number of sellers in the market which may  over time  give the remaining sellers increasing market strength and adversely affect the price and other terms of charged off credit card accounts 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  we may experience reduced access to portfolios of charged off consumer receivables in sufficient amounts at appropriate prices 
if this were to occur  our business may be seriously harmed 
our ability to recover on our charged off consumer receivables may be limited under federal and state laws 
federal and state consumer protection  privacy and related laws and regulations extensively regulate the relationship between debt collectors and debtors 
federal and state laws may limit our ability to recover on our charged off consumer receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part 
some laws and regulations applicable to credit card issuers may preclude us from collecting on charged off consumer receivables we purchase if the credit card issuer previously failed to comply with applicable law in generating or servicing those receivables 
additional consumer protection and privacy protection laws may be enacted that would impose additional or more stringent requirements on the enforcement of and collection on consumer receivables 
any new laws  rules or regulations as well as existing consumer protection and privacy protection laws  may adversely affect our ability to collect on our charged off consumer receivable portfolios and seriously harm our business 
in addition  federal and state governments are considering  and may consider in the future  other legislative proposals that would further regulate the collection of consumer receivables 
although we cannot predict if or how any future legislation would impact our business  any failure to comply with any current or future laws applicable to us could limit our ability to collect on our charged off consumer receivable portfolios  which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

table of contents our operating results may be harmed if we are unable to maximize our call center capacity utilization 
our profitability is influenced significantly by our call center capacity utilization 
we attempt to maximize utilization 
however  we have significantly higher utilization during peak periods 
from time to time we assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our contact centers 
accordingly  we may  if deemed necessary  consolidate or close under performing centers in order to maintain or improve utilization and margins 
we may not be able to achieve or maintain optimal contact center capacity utilization 
if we lose one or more significant clients  or if the volume of calls from any such client or clients decline  or if a significant contract is not implemented in the time frame and budget anticipated  our operating results are likely to be harmed unless and until we are able to reduce expenses proportionally or successfully negotiate contracts with new clients to generate additional revenues at a comparable level 
increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could seriously harm our business 
we depend on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
because of this dependence  any change to the telecommunications market that would disrupt these services or limit our ability to obtain services at favorable rates could harm our business 
we have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to the risks associated with rate fluctuations and service disruption by entering into long term contracts 
there is no obligation  however  for these vendors to renew their contracts with us or to offer the same or lower rates in the future  and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could seriously harm our business 
the financial results of our receivables management segment depend on our ability to purchase charged off receivable portfolios on acceptable terms and in sufficient amounts 
if we are unable to do so  our business will be harmed 
if we are unable to purchase charged off consumer receivables from credit originators on acceptable terms and in sufficient amounts  our business will be harmed 
the availability of portfolios that generate an appropriate return on our investment depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control  including continued growth in the levels of consumer debt  continued growth in the number of industries selling charged off consumer receivable portfolios  continued sales of charged off consumer receivable portfolios by credit originators  competition from other buyers of consumer receivable portfolios  and our ability to purchase portfolios in industries in which we have little or no experience with the resulting risk of lower returns if we do not successfully purchase and collect these receivables 
our inability to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could seriously harm our business 
the crm and receivables management industries are very labor intensive and experience high personnel turnover 
many of our employees receive modest hourly wages and  although we employ a significant number of full time employees  many are nevertheless employed on a part time basis 
some of our operations require specially trained employees 
we must recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
a significant portion of our costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
an increase in hourly wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could seriously harm our business 

table of contents because we have operations in countries outside of the united states  we may be subject to political  economic and other conditions affecting such countries that could result in increased operating expenses and regulation on our business 
we operate or rely upon businesses in numerous countries outside the united states 
we may expand into additional countries and regions 
there are risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  uncertainty regarding intellectual property protection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
if one or more of such factors occurs our business could be harmed 
the loss of one or more key clients would result in the loss of net revenues 
in  and  our largest clients represented  and of total revenue  respectively 
one customer  at t  accounted for of our total revenue in and and of total revenue in and  respectively 
if we fail to retain a significant amount of business from at t or any of our other significant clients  our business could be seriously harmed 
many of our contracts are cancelable by the client at any time or on short term notice  and clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty 
thus  our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue 
we serve clients and industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation in recent years 
additional consolidating transactions could occur in which our clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired 
the loss of any significant client could seriously harm our business 
because of the length of time involved in collecting charged off consumer receivables on acquired portfolios and the volatility in the timing of our collections  we may not be able to identify trends and make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner 
we entered into a number of forward flow contracts during these contracts commit a debt seller to regularly sell charged off receivables to us and commit us to purchase receivables for a fixed percentage of the face amount 
consequently  our results of operations could be harmed if the fixed percentage price is higher than the appropriate market value 
worldwide has entered into such contracts in the past and plans to do so in the future depending on market conditions 
to the extent new or existing competitors enter into forward flow contracts  the pool of portfolios available for purchase may be diminished 
we are exposed to the risks that third parties may violate our proprietary rights 
our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents  trademarks  trade names  trade secrets or other intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm our business 
the actions we take to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we may not be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information 
any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights 
in addition  third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages 
an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party s patent or to license alternative technology from another party 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 

table of contents our networks are exposed to the risks of software failure 
the software that we have purchased and developed to provide our products and services may contain undetected errors 
although we generally engage in extensive testing of our software prior to introducing the software onto any of our networks and or product equipment  errors may be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any of these errors may result in partial or total failure of our networks  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of clients to use our service or the cancellation of services by significant customers 
our clients may be affected by rapid technological change and systems availability 
we may be unable to introduce solutions on a timely basis 
we have invested in sophisticated and specialized computer and telephone technology 
our business relies on this technology to provide customized solutions to meet our client s needs 
we anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain our competitiveness 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to develop technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands 
our products and services are dependent upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our facilities against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
despite taking a variety of precautions  we have experienced downtime in our infrastructure from time to time and we may experience downtime in the future 
these types of service interruptions could result in the loss of significant clients and revenue 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common stock  quarterly variations in actual liquidity of the trading market of our common stock  quarterly variations in actual and anticipated operating results  growth rates  changes in estimates by analysts  change of analyst coverage  market conditions in the industries in which we compete  announcements by competitors  the loss of a significant client or a significant change in our relationships with a significant client  regulatory actions  litigation  including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility  which would distract management  result in substantial costs and could result in significant judgments against us 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could cause serious harm to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gary and mary west can exercise significant control over us 
gary west  our chairman  and mary west  our vice chair of the board of directors  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  mr 
and mrs 
west can exercise significant control over the outcome of substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders 
mr 
and mrs 
west can demand registration of their shares  which may have a material affect on our stock price volatility 
terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business 
the risks of war and potential terrorist attacks on our operations cannot be estimated 
however  we believe war and terrorist attacks could disrupt our operations 
for example the agent based business may 
table of contents experience significant reductions in call volume during the initial phases of any significant event  and the conferencing business may experience significant increases in call volume 
pending and future litigation may divert management time and attention and result in substantial costs of defense damages or settlement  which would seriously harm our business 
we face uncertainties relating to the pending litigation described in item legal proceedings 
we also cannot predict whether any other material suits  claims  or investigations may arise in the future based on the same claims as those described in item legal proceedings or other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business 
regardless of the outcome of any of these lawsuits or any future actions  claims  or investigations relating to the same or any other subject matter  we may incur substantial defense costs and such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention 
also  it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could seriously harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

the amended and restated facility bears interest at a minimum of basis points over the selected libor and a maximum of basis points over the selected libor 
at december  the contractual interest rate was basis points over the selected libor 
based on our obligation under this facility at december   a basis point change would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
we are party to a synthetic lease agreement that had an outstanding balance of million at december  the synthetic lease has interest terms similar to that of the revolving credit facility and bears interest at a variable rate over a selected libor based on our leverage  which adjusts quarterly in or basis point increments 
the weighted average annual interest rate at december  was 
the lease bears interest at a minimum of basis points over the selected libor and a maximum of basis points over the selected libor 
based on our obligation under this synthetic lease at december   a basis point change would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately we do not believe that changes in future interest rates on these variable rate obligations would have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we have not hedged our exposure to interest rate fluctuations
