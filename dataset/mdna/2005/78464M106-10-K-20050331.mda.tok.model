home entertainment home entertainment products represent the largest current market for our technologies and have historically been the largest revenue contributor to our licensing business 
manufacturers in this market utilize our technologies to differentiate their products from their competitors and improve functionality and product performance 
in many instances  manufacturers license multiple technologies from us for multiple product lines and divisions 
product categories within this market  include televisions  advanced displays  such as projection  plasma and lcd  set top boxes  dvd players  audio video receivers and complete home theater in a box system 
televisions 
our audio technologies are widely used by television manufacturers as not only a differentiating feature  but also because they resolve a multitude of audio challenges that manufacturers encounter 
as the television market migrates from bulky tube models to thinner digital displays  manufacturers are finding that they have less room for speakers  which in turn compromises the overall audio quality of the television 
from bass enhancement and dialog clarity to virtual surround sound  we provide manufacturers with patented solutions that deliver outstanding audio quality  without the expense of additional equipment or larger speakers 
in  we announced several new and expanded licensing relationships in the tv segment  including akai  ben q  dell  lg electronics  hyundai image quest  samsung and metz 
during the year we also announced a collaborative partnership with chinese tv manufacturer skyworth to develop audio technologies for the chinese consumer electronics market 
in  our technologies have increasingly been implemented in flat panel tvs and monitors such as lcds  plasma and projection displays 
the flat panel display market has grown significantly  and over the past year  our licensing royalties derived from flat panels have increased as these advanced models are quickly replacing traditional crt cathode ray tube televisions 
dvd players set top boxes 
a primary challenge for dvd player  recorder and set top box manufacturers is that the average household uses a two speaker audio system  while most of the content played over these devices is encoded in multichannel audio 
we have developed a technology that creates a virtual surround sound experience over any existing two speaker systems  including the internal speakers of a television 
our technology also creates a virtual surround experience from stereo material 
in  we announced a cooperative agreement with st microelectronics for exclusive worldwide sales and marketing of trusurround xt for digital set top box applications 
as well  our technologies continue to be included in set top boxes from hughes for directv and motorola 
in the dvd market  we have seen a continued slowdown of licensing royalties as a result of increasing pricing pressure on stand alone dvd playback devices and ongoing transition to new dvd recorder devices 
a v receivers home theater in a box 
the receiver is the central hub for a typical home theater system and is rapidly becoming integrated into a home theater in a box system that comes complete with a dvd player  vcr  cd player  set top box and speakers 
our portfolio of technologies can address this rapidly growing market from bass enhancement to the improvement of the center channel dialog or front speaker stereo enhancement to full surround sound 
in  we announced new or expanded oem relationships with companies including marantz  pioneer and motorola for their latest home entertainment systems 
personal telecommunications personal telecommunications  which include mobile phones  are becoming a true convergent product as many of the newest generation handsets and wireless products are quickly becoming complete personal entertainment devices 
we first penetrated the mobile phone market in with our vip technology  the first patented voice technology for mobile phones that provides significant spoken word comprehension to handset users through real time digital signal analysis and processing 
with the advent of multimedia functionality  including digital music playback  ring tones  streaming video  two way video conferencing  gaming  digital video recording and tv viewing  we continue to work with many of the leading mobile phone and voice communications companies to implement our voice technology solutions in communications products 
due to simple physical constraints  handset makers face the difficult challenge of achieving high quality audio during playback of these multimedia applications 
most often  headphones or ear buds are selected for their cost  convenient small size and aesthetics  rather than for their audio performance 
for handsets with integrated external speakers  the device size limits the speaker size  the spacing and even the separation between two speakers if they can fit in the device at all 
various popular audio compression schemes and codecs can also adversely affect the quality of reproduced audio due to the compression methodologies 
to address these problems  in we developed wow xt for mobile  the industry s first complete audio enhancement solution designed to improve the quality of any audio played on mobile devices 
this advanced technology suite contains stereo audio  psychoacoustic bass enhancements  noise reduction  voice clarity and voice quality enhancement technologies 
coupled with valuable audio management utility techniques that manage the audio level  this solution overcomes the physical limitations of small speaker drivers and headphones and improves the audio and voice quality  ensuring the best possible user experience for consumers 
in  we further enhanced our portfolio of solutions for wireless devices with the introduction of srs d positional audio  which is a psychoacoustic audio rendering engine that makes audio cues sound as if they have been placed in a three dimensional area in the space around the listener s head 
whether the device has one speaker  two closely spaced speakers  or relies on headphone or ear bud playback  our audio and voice solutions can be customized for any handset maker or oem s specific requirements and handset design 
we also have enabling and utility technologies to help overcome the physical limitations of the small speaker drivers and headphones of mobile devices to produce a more natural  realistic and immersive audio experience 
some of these technologies include the ability to preserve the original music source s stereo instrumentation during stereo to mono mix down  the ability to manage the output level of multiple audio sources to prevent clipping  and many other breakthrough solutions that help handset makers increase their market share by providing cost effective audio enhancement solutions that help mobile carriers attract and keep more customers 
for the newer stereo speaker enabled mobile phones  wow xt provides the industry s most extreme stereo width from polyphonic ring tones and digitally compressed music formats such as mp  wma and aac 
these solutions for mobile phones are primarily implemented using software 
the key benefit of adding srs software technologies is that hardware design changes aren t needed to quickly achieve fuller  more dynamic audio 
the wow xt audio enhancement suite  voice processing suite  audio management utility suite and srs d positional audio technology are either available now or in development for a wide variety of popular mobile software solutions  platforms and processors 
during  companies including fangtek  nec  sharp and samsung either signed a new licensing agreement with srs  or expanded their use of srs technologies for their latest personal telecommunications devices 
portable media the use of portable media players  such as mp and portable listening devices  is widespread around the world  reflecting demand from consumers to take their music and soon their video with them 
while the demand for more entertainment features increases  the size of the devices are decreasing and because of simple physical design constraints  the quality of the audio experience cannot always be maintained 
the small footprint of these devices limits speaker size  speaker spacing and the quality of headphone listening is variable since headphones are often selected for their small size and aesthetics rather than their audio performance 
in addition to physical considerations  the various audio compression algorithms in common use  such as mp  aac and wma  can adversely affect the quality of the reproduced audio depending on factors such as encoded bit rate and encoder quality level 
manufacturers of these devices are looking for solutions to improve the listening experience without affecting design change  increasing power consumption or adding additional product components 
similar to the mobile phone market  our solutions for portable media devices are primarily implemented using software  which allows manufacturers to quickly and easily implement our technologies once they have been optimized for their specific software and hardware requirements 
the primary technology solution for this market is srs wow  which is a suite of patented techniques designed to create a full  rich and wide audio image over one speaker  two speakers or headphones 
as of the end of  our srs wow technology libraries were available on a wide variety of the portable media device market s leading semiconductor and software platforms 
in  we announced new or expanded licensing agreements with oems including lg electronics  rio japan and samsung 
personal computers advances in computer technology and flat panel lcd monitors with speakers have transformed personal computers into home theater media hubs 
through pcs  users can now enjoy and manage collections of music and movies  as well as satellite and cable tv programs  and can distribute this multimedia content throughout the home using popular networking protocols 
with computer functionality growing every day  and the form factor of these devices shrinking and flattening  gone are the days of large crt monitors or pc towers under the desk 
most traditional desktop pc makers have now focused their product lines into notebook and tablet computers from ultra portable to widescreen portable home theaters 
we have developed specific technology solutions that deliver home theater sound from small and closely spaced speakers  as well as from headphones 
our technologies enhance the audio experience from any content and any application 
in  we achieved a major milestone for the penetration of this market and introduced system level drivers for adi soundmax  sigmatel and realtek audio codecs 
our drivers are whql tested by our audio codec partners and can be delivered as signed drivers 
in addition  we can provide generic system level drivers that can be used by manufacturers for custom integration into their graphical user interface 
the design premise behind these system level driver solutions is that by delivering srs technology on a low level within the audio path  any audio played through the computer  no matter the application or source  can be enhanced 
the value for manufacturers is that their product s overall sound quality is instantly improved through the use of srs technologies and can be achieved cost effectively 
leading semiconductor companies also provide numerous analog audio processor chips that include our technology 
by the end of  our customers in this market included sony  who incorporated our wow technology into their vaio desktops and toshiba  who licensed our srs trusurround for their line of satellite and qosmio laptop computers 
in addition  micro star international licensed our d audio technology for its mega pc product line 
automotive in  we developed srs circle surround automotive  a special version of our circle surround technology that can be customized by car manufacturers for the specific audio requirements of any vehicle 
circle surround delivers up to channels of full bandwidth surround sound from any audio source  including the radio  cds and even mp files burned onto a cd 
rear seat passengers are increasingly using dvd systems for entertainment 
our trusurround technology  which is widely used by traditional dvd player manufacturers  provides a realistic virtual surround sound experience over traditional headphones 
in addition  our srs automotive technology  which is a suite of audio enhancement and processing technologies that can be optimized for two or more speaker systems  or headphone playback provides remarkable improvement in the width  height and depth of any mono or stereo audio source  as well as provides deep  rich bass enhancement 
while little revenue was generated from this market segment during  we think this market holds significant long term opportunities for the license of our technologies 
in  we achieved several design wins with leading manufacturers and automakers  including johnson controls  honda  toyota and fujitsu ten 
the following table identifies a few of our largest licensing customers and the market or markets for which such licensees are licensing our technologies  as of december  oem name home entertainment personal telecom portable media devices personal computer automotive amtran benq cantronic changhong hitachi ltd 
hughes network system kenwood corporation lg electronics marantz corporation motorola bcs nec corporation philips consumer electronics pioneer corporation reigncom iriver samsung electronics sharp corporation skyworth sony corporation st microelectronics toshiba corporation our six largest customers accounted for more than of our licensing revenues in  and one customer  st microelectronics  accounted for approximately of our licensing revenues 
our strategy semiconductors our strategy in our semiconductor business is to integrate our srs technologies into our ics and to leverage our technology to create added value for our semiconductor customers 
manufacturers of electronic products are under increasing pressure to bring their products to market rapidly  at lower cost and with differentiated features 
we believe that our audio technologies provide a compelling differentiable feature 
in  we leveraged our expertise in the design of integrated circuits and began development of a series of semiconductor products that included srs technology 
in mass production began on many of these products and by the end of  of the asp product line included srs technology chips 
these chips include a wide variety of stand alone analog solutions for srs technologies  including srs wow  srs trubass  srs d  srs focus and srs dialog clarity that are marketed to the high growth and high volume product categories manufactured in the asia pacific region  such as portable audio systems  televisions  lcd monitors  portable audio devices and computers 
in  we also launched several universal audio processors that combined our audio technologies with standard audio functions such as volume  tone and level  as well as the first asp branded dsp processors with srs technology 
licensing our sales strategy is to identify high growth markets  develop needed technology solutions and features and work with software and semiconductor platform partners to make these technologies widely available and easy to implement by oems and odms 
we believe that we will continue to strengthen our market position as a world leader in audio and voice technology by employing the strategy of providing a continuous stream of patented audio and voice technologies  penetrating new licensing accounts  expanding relationships with existing licensees  creating a broad platform of software and semiconductor partners and developing strong brand awareness of the srs logo 
the mission of our licensing platform strategy is to achieve comprehensive and strategic coverage for our technology solutions within all of our targeted vertical product markets in order to expand sales and licensing opportunities 
by developing strong relationships with the leading software and semiconductor companies  our audio technologies can be delivered to customers worldwide across high growth and high volume product applications 
our licensing model most often employs a system whereby our licensees or prospective licensees request that srs technologies are enabled on key industry platforms from leading semiconductor manufacturers and middleware or firmware software providers platform partners 
oftentimes  the request is first made goes to the platform provider 
in other circumstances  we may proactively target a new emerging platform in one of our five market segments 
we work together with our platform partners to provide our mutual customers with the technology which best fits their needs 
we also together solicit other customers who use the platform 
as a technology licensing company  one of our greatest assets is the strength of our brand 
since brand recognition drives licensing sales  we have invested in strategies that increase consumer awareness of srs labs with the ultimate goal of establishing our brand with both product manufacturers and consumers around the world as the symbol for high quality audio 
the three primary vehicles that we use to further the proliferation of our brand are a placement of the srs logo by oems on products and in co marketing programs  b online branding programs  and c use  and recognition of use  of srs technology by content and broadcast professionals 
oem marketing programs 
over million consumer electronics hardware or software products have been shipped or downloaded that feature srs technologies 
our logo is either prominently displayed on the product itself or  in the case of software products and mobile phones  featured in the graphical user interface 
this consistent logo exposure is considered a key tool in reaching consumers worldwide 
in addition  we work with our oem customers as they launch new products that feature srs technologies 
we supply complete srs corporate and technology tool kits with a wide array of material  including srs logos  illustrations  technology explanations and suggested demonstration material 
in  we worked with toshiba as well as sony pc in the creation of point of purchase videos that are used on display pcs in leading retail outlets around the united states 
these videos included information on srs technology as well as displayed our logo  thereby reinforcing the consumer s awareness of the srs feature inside their product purchase 
online branding 
online exposure has also been an important part of our branding strategy 
a significant component of our relationship with microsoft is that the srs logo displayed in the audio control panel of microsoft s windows media player links to an srs technology page 
as a result  over million audio enthusiasts who use their computers for music and entertainment playback visited our website in and were further exposed to the srs brand 
we also market hardware and software products for consumers that feature our audio technologies 
these products are sold exclusively online through our e commerce site  www 
wowthing 
com 
the wow thing is a small processor that can be installed between speakers or headphones and the sound card or cpu of most personal computer systems 
it enhances the sound quality of cds as well as digitally compressed audio  which is downloaded or streamed over the internet 
the cs ii plug in for the windows media player delivers a full surround sound experience for stereo and mono music  videos and streaming audio 
in  we created a consumer plug in version of our latest stereo enhancement technology  wow xt  for the windows media player platform 
revenue from the sale of these products is insignificant  but gives us a valuable demonstration platform to showcase our audio technologies 
use of srs technology by content and broadcast professionals 
we develop  license and sell professional hardware and software products and consumer software plug ins primarily as a means of enabling content companies  broadcasters and music publishers to encode their material in our circle surround  or cs  technology 
when cs is professionally used  the logo is displayed within the content itself  on the packaging material  or in the case of radio an announcement that the broadcast is being delivered in srs circle surround is played 
we have concentrated on three key market segments in the pro audio space television  radio and music  and have developed a full line of hardware and software products to support these markets 
these products are sold directly to professional customers and are also available from selected dealers and distributors servicing the professional audio and broadcast communities 
we did not generate significant revenue from the sale of professional hardware equipment in and the outlook for significant revenue generation remains unproven  but we believe there is great value in continuing to pursue this market as a key element of our branding strategy 
top television broadcasters in the united states and abroad  who have transmitted circle surround encoded programs include abc  cbs  nbc  espn  espn  espn hd  fox  fx  tnt  pbs for dozens of programs including the th annual prime time emmy awards  x games  nfl and nba broadcasts  and more 
in september  we entered into a strategic alliance with coming home studios llc chs to produce and sell concert dvds which include our circle surround technology 
in connection with the strategic alliance  srs labs and chs entered into four agreements a strategic alliance agreement  the chs srs llc operating agreement  a warrant agreement and a production services agreement 
in the strategic alliance agreement  srs labs and chs agree to work together to identify and implement co promotional opportunities  including trade shows  movie theaters  video streaming  concert dvds  artist endorsements  bundling and premium deals  web based promotional clips and road shows 
the initial term of the agreement expires on july  and is automatically renewable for successive one year terms 
under the terms of this agreement  the branding opportunities on each dvd released by chs through the terms of the agreement include a a short video of the srs logo displayed prior to reaching the menu on the dvd  and b an instructional video on setting up a circle surround home theater system  which is available in the special features menu 
for those dvds encoded in circle surround  the cs logo will be prominently displayed on the packaging of the dvd as well as in promotional material used by distributors worldwide 
sales and marketing we have two types of revenue collection systems with our licensees bundled or non bundled 
under a bundled agreement  royalty revenue may be collected by our platform partner at the time the solution is sold to the oem or odm 
most often  however  we collect revenue directly from our licensees 
these licensing arrangements with oems or odms authorize them to design  build and sell products containing our technology 
under this licensing method  oem product licensees are free to choose a semiconductor solution from the platform partner that best suits their technical and cost of goods sold requirements 
we receive royalties directly from the licensed oem or odm for the use of our technologies in licensed products manufactured and shipped by the oem or odm 
many major oems have licenses or purchase products manufactured by a licensed odm for the use of one or more of our technologies and for the use and display of our trademarks 
in the case of the platform partner who bundles our royalty within their solution  the cost of the solution includes our royalty at the time it is sold 
the platform partner remits that royalty directly back to us on behalf of the licensee  thus streamlining the royalty collection process of royalty reporting 
our process for selecting particular platform partners for distributing our technology is based on several criteria including a segment leadership we target chip partners that hold preeminent positions in market segments characterized by high growth  volume and or margins  b volume platforms which will maximize exposure of our technologies to a large number of potential oems  c synergy platforms which serve to position our technologies along with compatible and additive technologies for integrated delivery  and d convergence potential which enable us to establish a presence on platforms that intersect merging functional features 
an example of this would be the platforms for new personal multifunctional devices that include mobile phone  personal digital assistant  or pda  and mp capabilities 
the following table identifies a few of our chip partners who have entered into licensing agreements with us and a few of our software partners who have developed software formats and operating systems for which our technology solutions are implemented  and the market or markets for which such licensees or partners are marketing our technologies as of december  chip software partner name home entertainment personal telecom portable media devices personal computer automotive analog devices arm asp microelectronics cirrus logic freescale micronas new japan radio corporation njrc philips semiconductor sigmatel st microelectronics texas instruments to implement our licensing sales strategy within our identified vertical markets  we have established a direct sales force and a worldwide network of independent sales agents 
in north america  we employ a direct sales force to market our portfolio of audio and voice technologies to the oem community 
internationally  we maintain support offices in the czech republic  japan  hong kong and korea to support our multi national oem customers 
we actively promote the use of our trademarks and logos and direct customers to prominently display the appropriate srs technology logo on products  packaging and in advertising 
we work closely with our licensees to enhance their success in selling finished products and semiconductor products that incorporate our technologies through a variety of licensee support programs 
these programs include engineering support  sales training  tradeshow support  press support  customized marketing materials and corporate communications 
our corporate communications program includes press releases  advertising  speaking engagements and industry conferences 
we use the internet to provide easy to use audio technology demonstrations for those technologies that can be appropriately demonstrated on the world wide web 
we conduct in person technology demonstrations or presentations for the press and other companies to promote our technologies and products 
we also regularly participate in tradeshows and conferences to increase awareness of our technologies and to market our technologies and products 
we work closely with our licensees and chip partners to actively explore additional opportunities to place our technologies in new products and or markets 
backlog backlog is applicable only to our semiconductor business 
sales of semiconductors are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of asic and ic products 
order quantities and delivery schedules are frequently changed to reflect product availability  scheduling at our fabrication partner facilities or changes in our customers needs 
customer orders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
accordingly  our backlog at any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
for this reason  we believe that backlog is not generally a good indicator of future revenue 
as of december and  the backlog of orders for asic and ic products to non affiliated parties was  and  respectively 
we expect that all or substantially all of the current backlog of orders for will be completed in research and development our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuous improvement in products and services 
our research and development expenditures in  and were approximately  and of total operating expenses respectively 
these expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees and consultants engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs for engineering materials and supplies 
as of december   we had employees in our r d group representing of our total human resources 
our software  hardware and application engineers focus on developing intellectual property  technology solutions and consumer products 
fourteen engineers are based in the us with the remainder based in hong kong 
competition we compete in each of our business segments with a number of different companies  which produce a variety of technologies  processes and products 
semiconductors the asia pacific semiconductor industry is dominated by several major suppliers  such as motorola  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
these established semiconductor companies usually do not offer custom design services to manufacturers and will only do so if the number of semiconductors required by such manufacturers is very large 
instead  they supply standard ic products to their customers 
we occasionally compete with smaller design houses in japan  taiwan or korea  such as sunplus  but most of these design houses are focused on standard semiconductor chip categories  such as random access memory  micro controller and other non proprietary functional processes 
we believe that our asic team is more flexible in its strategy of designing new products  as well as more responsive in the service provided to clients 
with years of experience in the asia pacific semiconductor market  our large accumulated design ip library can be reused for different designs and can support a shorter chip development cycle and a lower chip cost 
using our proprietary software  many of our designs can be re targeted for different foundries and processes  which allows us to reduce risk and cost 
we have strong in house testing capabilities  using state of the art software and hardware development tools 
we also believe that our expertise in local business practices and a strong franchise of relationships with clients gives us a competitive advantage over newcomers to the industry and large multi national firms 
our ability to develop standard ics that incorporate our audio technologies has opened up new chip sales opportunities  but could in the future cause channel conflict with our network of srs technology semiconductor partners 
our objective is to minimize this conflict by concentrating our design and sales efforts on chip products for markets and product applications that are underserved by our existing semiconductor partners 
the markets in which we sell our products are also subject to extreme price competition 
accordingly  we expect to continue to experience declines in the selling prices of our products over the life cycle of each product 
in order to offset declines in the selling prices of our products  we must continue to reduce the costs of products through product design changes  manufacturing process changes  volume discounts and other savings negotiated with our manufacturing subcontractors 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing facilities  we may not be able to reduce costs as rapidly as competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
our ability to design and introduce  in a timely manner  lower cost versions of existing products or higher gross margin new products  or to successfully manage our manufacturing subcontractor relationships  could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins 
licensing competition in the audio  voice and surround sound technology licensing business includes other licensing companies who offer competing technologies as well as the internal engineering department of our licensees  who may develop audio enhancement techniques for their own products 
in the field of d audio enhancement  we compete directly with other audio providers  including qsound  spatializer  aureal and bbe sound 
our newly launched d positional audio technology directly competes with technologies from qsound and synoptic 
we believe that our bass enhancement technology  trubass  competes directly with several technologies  including maxxbass from waves  ltd  vibe from spatializer  and non proprietary bass systems  such as bass boost  that are included on a variety of electronics products  including televisions  portable stereos and speaker products 
because our audio enhancement techniques work with any existing recorded material  whether mono  stereo or surround sound  most of our audio enhancement technologies  including srs d sound  srs focus  srs trubass and srs dialog clarity  can be used either as an alternative or as a complement and enhancement to almost any competing audio technology 
many companies in the wireless and telecommunications industry are investigating methods to increase the quality of a voice signal  but we believe that their development work focuses on techniques to reduce noise and provide echo cancellation 
we are not aware of any direct competing technologies to our voice technology  vip  which processes the actual voice signal to improve intelligibility and works on the formants of the human speech pattern 
vip is compatible to these other noise cancellation techniques 
several technologies within our surround sound portfolio  including trusurround  trusurround xt  circle surround and circle surround ii  compete directly with a variety of technologies from spatializer  qsound  dolby laboratories and dts  inc these competing processes include dolby prologic and prologic ii  which are analog  surround sound systems that can encode surround content as well as decode up to channels of surround sound from mono or stereo  dolby digital ac and dolby digital ex  that encode a six channel digital sound track on a movie print and decode six channels of digital audio in a consumer electronics device  dolby virtual speaker  which processes the multichannels of dolby digital or dolby surround over just two channels  creating a virtual surround sound experience  dts  which uses cds to reproduce six channels of digital sound synchronized with a movie print and decodes the six channels of sound in a consumer electronics device  dts neo  which decodes up to channels of surround sound from mono or stereo  and n from spatializer  which processes the multichannels of surround sound over two speakers 
many of the companies referenced above have  or may have  substantially greater resources than us to devote to further technologies and new product developments 
we believe that we compete based primarily on the quality and performance of our proprietary technologies  brand name awareness  the ease and cost of implementing our technologies  the ability to meet oems needs to differentiate their products  and the strength of our licensee relationships 
however  there can be no assurance that based on these factors  we will continue to be competitive with existing or future products or technologies of our competitors 
in the broadcast and professional audio markets  our circle surround technology competes directly with surround sound formats from dolby laboratories and dts  inc  which market professional products for the encoding and creation of multichannel content 
both of these companies have more established reputations  greater technical  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities and stronger brand presence in the movie cinema  television broadcast and music recording segments of professional audio 
these competitors also have established or may establish strategic relationships with potential customers of our circle surround technology that may affect our customer s decisions to purchase products or license technology from us 
intellectual property rights and proprietary information we operate in industries where innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of intellectual property rights are important for success 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and services  including patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual obligations 
we pursue a policy of enforcing such rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that our intellectual property rights will be adequate to ensure our competitive position  or that competitors will not be able to produce a non infringing competitive product or service 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us  or that if required to obtain any third party licenses as a result of an infringement dispute  we will be able to obtain such licenses 
although we believe that our patents and trademarks are important to each of our business segments  such patents and trademarks are especially important to the licensing business segments 
in order to protect the underlying technology concepts  we have filed and or obtained patents for all of our marketed technologies including technologies marketed under the trademarks srs  trusurround  trusurround xt  focus  circle surround  circle surround ii  wow  vip and trubass 
in addition  we have numerous issued patents and patents pending for speaker and other acoustic reproduction technologies 
we pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the united states and various foreign countries where our licensees manufacture  distribute or sell licensed products 
we continually update and add new applications to our patent portfolio to address changing worldwide market conditions and our new technological innovations 
the range of expiration dates for our patents extend between the years to we have multiple patents covering unique aspects and improvements for many of our technologies 
accordingly  the expiration of any single patent is not likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position or the ability to generate licensing revenue 
our strategy for protection of our trademarks identifying the various srs technology solutions is commensurate with our strategy for obtaining patent protection 
specifically  we routinely file us federal and foreign trademark applications for the various word names and logos used to market our technology solutions to licensees and the general public 
the duration of the us and foreign registered trademarks can typically be maintained indefinitely  provided proper maintenance fees are paid and trademarks are continually used or licensed by us 
seasonality due to our dependence on the consumer electronics market  we experience seasonal fluctuation in sales and earnings 
in particular  we believe that the licensing business experiences seasonality relating to the christmas season in the fourth quarter  and the semiconductor business located in the asia pacific region experiences seasonality related to the chinese new year in the first quarter 
we have moved toward diversifying our key market segments in the consumer electronics industry in an effort to even out our seasonal fluctuation 
employees as of december  we employed persons  in finance and administration  in research and development  engineering and product development  and in sales and marketing 
of the employees  are employed in our semiconductor business and are located overseas 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are presently represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any labor problems or a work stoppage and believe we have good relations with our employees

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts operating expenses  valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  valuation of intangible assets and capitalization of software  which primarily impacts operating expenses when we impair assets or accelerate their depreciation  and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision 
we discuss each of these policies below  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience and the age of past due receivables 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers may require additional provisions for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we periodically assess our inventory for potential obsolescence and lower of cost or market issues 
we make estimates of inventory obsolescence  providing reserves when necessary  based on  among other factors  demand for inventory based on backlog  product pricing  the ability to liquidate or sell older inventory  and the impact of introducing new products 
if actual market conditions or our customer s product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional provisions may be required 
intangible assets capitalization of software in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for fiscal  an independent valuation of goodwill and other intangibles was performed 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our adoption of sfas however  no assurances can be given that future evaluation of goodwill will not result in charges as a result of future impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  all of our intangible assets that have definite lives are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
costs paid by us related to the establishment and transfer of patents  primarily legal costs  are capitalized and amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years  depending on the estimated life of the technology patented 
consideration for the purchase of assets in excess of the fair market value of specifically identified tangible assets has been capitalized as intangible and is being amortized over periods ranging from three to years depending on the useful life of the asset 
we annually evaluate the recoverability of our patents and intangible assets based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
should the carrying value of patents or intangible assets exceed the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for the expected periods of benefit  such assets will be written down to fair value 
based upon its most recent assessment  we have determined that there was impairment of  as of december  costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others as a separate product or embedded in a product and sold as part of the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalize software purchased from third parties if the related software product under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the purchased software  provided that capitalized amounts will be realized over a period not exceeding five years 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense 
the establishment of technological feasibility and ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenues  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
under sfas no 
 annual amortization of software development costs should be the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
after considering the two methods  we are using the straight line method of amortization as the software can be used for many products and the estimates required to be made under the ratio that current gross revenues for products bear to the total of the current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product could result in under reporting of expense 
upon the general release of the software product to customers  capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized to cost of sales using the straight line method on a product by product basis over the estimated life  which is generally three years 
to the extent that amounts capitalized for software development costs become impaired due to a decline in demand or the introduction of new technology  such amounts will be written off 
all other research and development expenditures are charged to research and development expense in the period incurred 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the countries in which we operate 
the process used to make these estimates includes an assessment of the current tax expense  the results from tax examinations and the effects of temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of transactions for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the reliability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and loss and credit carry forwards 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood of their realization 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including deferred tax liabilities that can be used to offset deferred tax assets  estimates of future taxable income of appropriate character within the carry forward period available under the tax law  and tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting either in a tax benefit  if it is estimated that future taxable income is likely  or a reduction in the value of the deferred tax assets  if it is determined that their value is impaired  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the revision become known 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted

in february  srs labs completed an exchange offer with the minority shareholders of srswowcast  pursuant to which srs labs acquired all  outstanding shares of srswowcast series a convertible preferred stock in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
as a result of the exchange offer  an intangible in the amount of  was recorded and srswowcast became a wholly owned subsidiary of srs labs 
provision for income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal the higher tax expense in fiscal resulted almost entirely from taxes paid on earnings in our hong kong subsidiary at the tax rate of and higher levels of foreign tax paid on licensing revenues sourced from countries requiring foreign tax withholdings 
additionally  in we revised our estimates related to income tax payables resulting in a benefit of  in the current income tax provision 
we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards at december  of approximately  and  respectively 
the net operating loss carry forwards began expiring in and will continue through in addition  we had federal tax credit carry forwards of approximately  which begin to expire in as of december   a valuation allowance of  had been provided based on our assessment of our future ability to realize certain deferred tax assets 
selected quarterly operating results unaudited the following table sets forth certain quarterly summary financial data for the eight quarters in the period ended december  the quarterly information is based upon unaudited financial statements prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and  in management s opinion  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
this information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
due to rounding differences  the quarters in a given year may not add precisely to the annual numbers for that year

in fiscal  and  operations were funded primarily from cash from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the  increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily a result of net income of  further adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization of  deferred stock option compensation of  and impairment of intangibles of  accounts receivable increased during fiscal primarily due to increases in licensing revenues 
the total days sales outstanding on a consolidated basis were days at december  compared to days at december  our inventory  net of allowances  decreased  in fiscal due primarily to the sell off of backlog which built up in the second quarter of fiscal due to foundry capacity constraints and the sale of component inventory  which was previously reserved for in our provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the reversal of the provision provided a benefit of  for fiscal  which was offset by increases in the reserve of  associated with our periodic assessment of inventory to arrive at a net benefit of  prepaid expenses and other current assets increased  in fiscal due to the advance payment of promotional costs  which provide future benefits and are associated with our branding strategy 
in fiscal  accounts payable decreased  primarily due to decreases in our inventory that was partially offset by increases in deferred revenues of  due to increased prepayment of license fees and increases in accrued expenses of  our net cash used in investing activities was  and  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal is due primarily to increased treasury investing activities of  as a result of increasing interest rates  management elected to commit funds to longer term instruments 
during fiscal  we entered into a strategic alliance with coming home studios llc  which used cash of  additional investing activities  which used cash  were purchases of capital equipment and expenditures related to patents and intangible assets totaling  our net financing activities provided cash of  and  during fiscal year and  respectively and used cash of  during fiscal our financing activities during primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of  partially offset by the purchase of treasury shares for  we believe our existing cash balances and investments together with cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
no assurance can be given that such additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual cash obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments with regards to operating lease arrangements

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf issue no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf issue no 
addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means 
eitf issue no 
states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock of a corporation  provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
are effective for the first quarter of fiscal we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp emerging issues task force eitf issue  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which delays the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance in eitf issue no 
in addition  the fasb has issued a proposed fsp to consider whether further application guidance is necessary for securities analyzed for impairment under eitf issue no 
we continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of the proposed fsp could have on our financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
it requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement shall be applied prospectively for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement would have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  on a quarterly basis see note stock based compensation  we are currently evaluating the impact that this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp no 
 and fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp no 

these staff positions provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act of ajca that was signed into law on october  fsp no 
states that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
fsp no 
gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
we are investigating the repatriation provision to determine whether we might repatriate extraordinary dividends  as defined in the ajca and the actual income tax impact to us will become determinable once further technical guidance has been issued 
factors that may affect future results we are exposed to risks in our licensing business related to product and customer concentration currently  our licensing revenue is concentrated in the home theater market with the majority of revenue generated from the inclusion of srs technology inside televisions  dvd players and set top boxes 
we expect that the consumer home entertainment market will continue to account for a significant portion of our licensing revenues for the foreseeable future 
while consumer spending in general on consumer electronic products has increased  retail prices for certain consumer electronics products that include our audio technology  such as dvd players  have decreased significantly 
indications are that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
from time to time  certain of our original equipment manufacturer and semiconductor manufacturer customers may account for a significant portion of revenue from a particular product application  such as dvd players  set top boxes or televisions 
consumer electronics products manufacturers could decide to exclude our audio enhancement technology from their home theater products altogether in an effort to reduce cost 
the loss of any such customer could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is highly dependent on the consumer electronics market  which is characterized by short product life cycles  fluctuations in demand and seasonality  and subject to risks related to product transitions and supply of other components the consumer electronics market is characterized by intense competition  rapidly evolving technology  and ever changing consumer preferences 
these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles and significant price competition 
the dynamic nature of this market limits our  as well as our customers  ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual sales 
if we  or our customers  are unable to manage product transitions  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
pricing pressures on the consumer electronics product manufacturers who incorporate our technologies into their products could limit the licensing fees we charge for our technologies  which could adversely affect our revenues the markets for the consumer electronics products in which our technologies are incorporated are intensely competitive and price sensitive 
retail prices for consumer electronics products that include our technologies  such as dvd players and home theater systems  have decreased significantly  and we expect prices to continue to decrease for the foreseeable future 
in response  manufacturers have sought to reduce their product costs  which can result in downward pressure on the licensing fees we charge our customers who incorporate our technologies 
a decline in the licensing fees we charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brand  and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brand  our business will be materially harmed maintaining and strengthening the srs brand is critical to maintaining and expanding both our products and services business and our technology licensing business  as well as to our ability to enter new markets for our audio and other technologies 
our continued success is due  in part  to our reputation for providing high quality products  services and technologies across multiple consumer electronics product segments 
if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the srs brand  our business and prospects will suffer 
our quarterly results may fluctuate our operating results may fluctuate from those in prior quarters and will continue to be subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the extent to which our licensees incorporate our technologies into their products  the timing of orders from  and the shipments to  major customers  the timing of new product introductions  the gain or loss of significant customers  competitive pressures on selling prices  the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our technologies  the rate that our semiconductor licensees manufacture and distribute chips to product manufacturers  and fluctuations in general economic conditions  particularly those affecting the consumer electronics market 
due to our dependence on the consumer electronics market  the substantial seasonality of sales in the market could impact our revenues and net income 
in particular  we believe that there is seasonality relating to the christmas season generally and the chinese new year within the asia region  which fall into the fourth and first quarters respectively 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
we are subject to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any future downturns could significantly harm our sales or reduce our profitability for a prolonged period of time 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry also has experienced periods of increased demand and production capacity constraints 
we may experience substantial changes in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  general economic conditions and other factors 
we rely on revenue contribution from our asic and standard ic business we derive a significant amount of our revenue from valence s asic business 
valence s engineering team focuses on the design of custom asics to meet specific customers requirements and outsources the production of the design to mask houses  foundries and packaging houses located primarily in asia 
the operations of valence could be affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of customer orders  the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products distributed and the mix of distribution channels employed  the emergence of a new industry standard  product obsolescence and changes in pricing policies by us  our competitors or our suppliers 
business revenue from asics is concentrated in a limited number of customers in the areas of consumer electronics  communications products  computers and computer peripherals 
the business generated from any one customer may be for a fixed length or quantity 
as such  it is customary in our asic business to have a certain amount of customer turnover as new asic projects are obtained for different customers 
however  it is possible that the loss of any particular customer or any bad debt arising from such customer may have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
valence adds significant diversity to our overall business structure and opportunities 
we recognize that in the presence of such corporate diversity  and in particular with regard to the semiconductor industry  there will always exist a potential for conflict among sales channels between us and our technology licensees 
although the operations of our licensing business and those of valence are generally complementary  there can be no assurances that sales channel conflicts will not arise 
if such potential conflicts do materialize  we may or may not be able to mitigate the effect of such perceived conflicts  which  if not resolved  may impact the results of operations 
potential channel conflict with existing semiconductor partners could cause us to lose future business as we bring out more and more valence semiconductors with srs audio technologies embedded in them  our current semiconductor partners may perceive those new devices as threats to their own products 
the semiconductor partners may respond by reducing or eliminating the volumes of business they presently do with us  which would have an adverse effect on our licensing revenue 
we are exposed to risks in our valence business related to product fabrication outsourcing to third parties valence is a fabless semiconductor company meaning that valence designs  develops and markets our selection of custom and standard integrated circuits but we rely on third party contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
from time to time there can be foundry capacity issues due to global demands that affect the semiconductor industry 
although we believe our relationships are generally good  we do not have long term supply agreements with our third party vendors and they are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any particular period or in any particular quantities  except as provided in each separate purchase order accepted by them 
the increased demand for our products coupled with the demand for foundry services  is  and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  a challenge for us 
in times of high demand  there are significant risks associated with our reliance on third party vendors including reallocation of capacity to other foundry customers  potential price increases  delays and interruptions in order deliveries  reduced control over product quality and increased risk of misappropriation of intellectual property 
we conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations  particularly in asia and the people s republic of china we have significant operations in hong kong  the people s republic of china prc and other parts of asia that require refinement to adapt to the changing market conditions in those regions 
our operations in asia  and international operations in general  are subject to risks of unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements 
our customers geographically located in the asia pacific markets accounted for approximately  and of total company sales in  and  respectively and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of sales in the future 
the economic climate in asia continues to be impacted by increases in unemployment  declines in consumer spending  currency devaluation and bank failures 
any of these factors  should they continue  could significantly reduce the demand for the end user goods in which our products and technologies are used 
the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors 
there can be no assurance that such growth will continue or that any potential currency devaluation in the region will not have a negative effect on our business  including valence 
the prc economy has also experienced deflation in the past  which may continue in the future 
the current economic situation may adversely affect our profitability over time as expenditures for consumer electronics products and information technology may decrease due to the results of slowing domestic demand and deflation 
hong kong is a special administrative region of the prc with its own government and legislature 
hong kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy from the prc under the principle of one country  two systems 
we can give no assurance that hong kong will continue to enjoy autonomy from the prc 
the hong kong dollar has remained relatively constant due to the us dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in hong kong since since mid  interest rates in hong kong have fluctuated significantly and real estate and retail sales have declined 
we can give no assurance that the hong kong economy will not worsen or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar will be maintained 
continued declining consumer spending in hong kong  deflation or the discontinuation of the currency peg could adversely affect our business 
we are exposed to currency fluctuations and instability in the asian markets we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  all of our licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
it is our expectation that licensing revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
because valence s business is primarily focused in asia and because of our anticipated expansion of business in the prc and other parts of asia  our consolidated results of operations and financial position could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold 
in addition  our valuation of assets recorded as a result of the valence acquisition may also be adversely impacted by the currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
we intend to actively monitor our foreign exchange exposure and to implement strategies to reduce our foreign exchange risk at such time that we determine the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
however  there is no guarantee that we will take steps to insure against such risks  and should such risks occur  there is no guarantee that we will not be significantly impacted 
if the sale of consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies does not grow in emerging markets  our ability to increase our licensing revenue may be limited we also expect that growth in our licensing revenue will depend  in part  upon the growth of sales of consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies in other countries  including china and india  as consumers in these markets have more disposable income and are increasingly purchasing entertainment products with surround sound capabilities 
however  if our licensing revenue from the use of our technologies in these new markets or geographic areas does not expand  our prospects could be adversely affected 
we are subject to competitive pressures our existing and potential competitors include both large and emerging domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
present or future competitors may be able to develop products and technologies comparable or superior to ours  and to adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving market needs 
we believe that the competitive factors affecting the market for our products and technologies include product performance  price and quality  product functionality and features  the ease of integration  and implementation of the products and technologies with other hardware and software components in the oem s products 
in addition  the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  declining average sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in its respective markets  that competition will not intensify or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle  which can result in uncertainty and delays in generating additional revenues historically  because of the complexity of our technologies  it can take a significant amount of time and effort to explain the benefits and to negotiate a sale 
for example  it typically takes six to nine months after our first contact with a prospective customer before we start licensing our technology to that customer 
in addition  purchase of our products is usually made in connection with new design starts  the timing of which is outside of our control 
accordingly  we may be unable to predict accurately the timing of any significant future sales of our products 
we may also spend substantial time and management attention on potential license agreements that are not consummated  thereby foregoing other opportunities 
we strongly rely on our intellectual property our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we have filed numerous us and foreign patent applications and to date have a number of issued us and foreign patents covering various aspects of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other property rights 
we are not currently a party to any claims of this nature 
there can be no assurances that third parties will not assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our customers with respect to existing or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights 
we depend on our key personnel our future success depends to a large extent upon the continued service of key personnel  including engineering  sales and marketing staff  and highly skilled semiconductor design staff 
we anticipate that any future growth will require us to recruit and hire a number of new personnel in engineering  operations  finance  sales and marketing 
competition for such personnel can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we can recruit and retain necessary personnel to operate our business and support future growth 
the market price of our common stock is volatile the trading price of our common stock has been  and will likely continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  strategic alliances between us and third parties  general market fluctuations and other events and factors 
changes in earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business  or relating to us specifically  have in the past resulted in  and could in the future result in  an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
even though our stock is quoted on the nasdaq stock market  our stock has had and may continue to have low trading volume and high volatility 
the historically low trading volume of our stock makes it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume  either up or down  will significantly impact the stock price 
since our shares are thinly traded  our shareholders may have difficulty selling our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as delaware law contain provisions that could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control  which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to discourage  delay or prevent change in control 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting investment earnings 
foreign currency international sales represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  all of our licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
we have subsidiary operations in hong kong and customers in the prc  and  accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use the local currency hong kong dollars as the functional currency for our valence subsidiaries 
the hong kong dollar has remained relatively constant due to the us dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in hong kong since to date  most of our semiconductor revenue and expenses incurred have been denominated in hong kong dollars 
translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars were not significant in fiscal   and cash balances maintained by valence in excess of normal operating requirements are invested in us denominated bank accounts further reducing balance sheet exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
under the current circumstances  we believe that the foreign currency market risk is not material  however  we can give no assurance that the hong kong economy will not worsen or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar will be maintained 
we actively monitor our foreign exchange exposure and  should circumstances change  intend to implement strategies to reduce our risk at such time that it determines that the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
there can be no assurance that management s efforts to reduce foreign exchange exposure will be successful 
interest rates our exposure to market risk includes changes in interest rates  which relates primarily to our invested balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our investment policy specifies excess funds are to be invested in a manner that preserves capital  provides liquidity and generates the highest available after tax return 
to limit exposure to market risk  we place our cash in banks  cash equivalents in high quality  short term commercial paper and money market funds and investments consisting of us government securities and u 
s government backed securities 
we do not invest in any derivative instruments 
all cash  cash equivalents and investments are carried at fair value  which approximates cost
