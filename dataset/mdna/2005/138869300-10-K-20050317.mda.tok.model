item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the matters discussed in this report on form k  when not historical matters  are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results 
such factors include  among others  the speculative nature of mineral exploration  commodity prices  production and reserve estimates  environmental and government regulations  availability of financing  judicial proceedings  force majeure events  and other risk factors as described from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
most of these factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update its forward looking statements  whether as a result of receiving new information  the occurrence of future events  or otherwise 
overview the company s cash and cash equivalents increased million from december  to december   primarily due to an equity financing which resulted in proceeds of million  the exercise of certain warrants  which resulted in proceeds of million  and the exercise of certain stock options  which resulted in proceeds of million 
these inflows allowed the company to absorb negative operating cash flow of million  and pay off the briggs equipment financing of million 
the company ended the year with million of cash and cash equivalents 
revenues continued to decline year over year  due to lower production levels  as the briggs operation nears the end of its mine life 
revenues declined in from levels and from levels 
improving spot gold prices resulted in price realizations of per ounce in as compared to per ounce in and per ounce in overall  the company s results of operations reflect higher losses year over year million in  million in  and million in as the improvement in price realizations was more than offset by lower aggregate revenues and higher unit costs of sales 
on march   a local citizens group miners  merchants and montanans for jobs and economic opportunity  for i  filed the language of a new initiative  i  to be placed before the voters of montana at the november  ballot which  if enacted  would have allowed use of cyanide leaching in open pit gold mines with specific  rigorous engineering practices and environmental safeguards 
on july   the official certification for the ballot was announced by the secretary of state 
on november   i  the ballot initiative that would have allowed the use of cyanide in processing gold and silver ores from new open pit mines  was defeated by montana voters 
as a result of this vote  the seven up pete venture plans to re investigate alternate technologies of gold mining and recovery of its gold deposits near lincoln  montana 
in addition  the company will continue to pursue its lawsuits against the state of montana regarding the enactment of i in state court and  if necessary  the federal court system

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the ensuing discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and contained within this report on form k 
certain amounts included in or affecting the company s financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring that certain assumptions be made with respect to values or conditions which cannot be made with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  the reported amounts of the company s assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production amortization determination  recoverability and timing of gold production from the heap leaching process  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments including estimates of future cash flows  useful lives and residual values of intangible assets  fair value of financial instruments  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following significant assumptions and estimates affect its more critical practices and accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
at least annually  the company estimates its ore reserves at its producing properties 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
ore reserve estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  declines in the market price of gold may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
the company uses its ore reserve estimates in determining the unit basis for mine depreciation and closure rates 
changes in ore reserve estimates could significantly affect these items 
the company produces gold at its briggs mine using the heap leaching process 
this process involves the application of cyanide solutions by drip irrigation to ore stacked on an impervious pad 
as the solution percolates through the heap  gold is dissolved from the ore into solution 
this solution is collected and processed with activated carbon  which precipitates the gold out of solution and onto the carbon 
through the subsequent processes of acid washing and pressure stripping  the gold is returned to solution in a more highly concentrated state 
this concentrated solution of gold is then processed in an electrowinning circuit  which re precipitates the gold onto cathodes for melting into gold dor bars 
the company must make certain estimates regarding this overall process  the most significant of which are the amount and timing of gold to be recovered 
although the company can calculate with reasonable certainty the tonnage and grades of ore placed under leach by engineering survey and laboratory analysis of drill hole samples  the recovery and timing factors are influenced by the size of the ore under leach crushed or run of mine and the particular mineralogy of a deposit being mined 
the company bases its estimates on laboratory leaching models  which approximates the ore under leach on the heap 
from this data  the company estimates the amount of gold that can be recovered and the time it will take for recovery 
the company continually monitors the actual monthly and cumulative recovery from the heap as a check against the laboratory models  however  ultimate recovery will not be known with certainty until active leaching has stopped and pad rinsing is completed 
because it is impossible to physically measure the amount of gold under leach  the company calculates  or derives the amount  by taking the difference between the cumulative estimated recoverable gold placed on the heap and the known amount of gold cumulatively produced as dor 
the company must capture and classify its inventory related costs to achieve the matching concept of expenses and revenues as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
costs capitalized to inventory relating to the heap leach pad include i the direct costs incurred in the mining and crushing of the rock and delivery of the ore onto the heap leach pad  ii applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization  and iii allocated indirect mine general and administrative overhead costs 
these costs are relieved from this 
table of contents inventory when gold is produced as dor  and added to i all direct costs incurred in the leaching and refining processes  ii applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization  and iii allocated indirect mine general and administrative overhead costs for determining the cost of inventory related to dor 
as the company s estimate of time to recover gold from first being placed under leach to dor production is twelve months  inventory costs are considered a current asset 
the briggs mine stopped loading ore on the heap leach pad in april and the company anticipates that active leaching with cyanide will end in april the company must estimate reclamation and site closure obligations well in advance of actual activities 
estimates are based primarily on environmental and regulatory requirements and the fair value of such obligations are recognized in the period incurred 
as additional information is obtained  revised estimates for producing operations are applied prospectively while revisions to estimates for operations already in the reclamation phase are reflected in net income in the period in which the revisions occur 
on january   the company became subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
fair value is determined by estimating the retirement obligations in the period an asset is first placed in service and then adjusting the amount for estimated inflation and market risk contingencies to the projected settlement date of the liability 
the result is then discounted to a present value from the projected settlement date to the date the asset was first place in service 
the present value of the asset retirement obligation is recorded as an additional property cost and as an asset retirement liability 
the amortization of the additional property cost using the units of production method is included in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the accretion of the discounted liability is recorded as a separate operating expense in the company s statement of operations 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 an accrual for the company s estimated asset retirement obligations site specific reclamation costs for earthwork  revegetation  water treatment and dismantlement of facilities was made using the units of production method over the life of the property and was included in cost of sales 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded a charge of  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding the company s adoption of sfas no 
the emerging issues task force eitf formed a committee to evaluate certain mining industry accounting issues  including issues arising from the application of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other tangible assets sfas no 
to business combinations within the mining industry  accounting for goodwill and other intangibles and the capitalization of costs after the commencement of production  including deferred stripping 
the issues discussed also included whether mineral rights conveyed by leases represent tangible or intangible assets and the amortization of such assets 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus  subject to ratification by the fasb  that mineral rights conveyed by leases should be considered tangible assets 
mineral rights are defined by the eitf as the legal right to explore  extract  and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits 
the eitf also reached a consensus  subject to ratification by the fasb  on other mining related issues involving impairment and business combinations 
on march   the fasb ratified the consensus of the eitf on other mining related issues involving impairment and business combinations 
this did not have an impact to the company s financial statements since it did not change the company s accounting 
the fasb also ratified the consensus of the eitf that mineral rights conveyed by leases should be considered tangible assets subject to the finalization of a fasb staff position fsp in this regard 
on april   the fasb issued a fsp amending sfas no 
and sfas no 
to provide that certain mineral use rights are considered tangible assets and that mineral use rights should be accounted for based on their substance 
if recharacterization of an asset results  prior period amounts in the statement of 
table of contents financial position are to be reclassified with any effects on amortization or depreciation prospectively applied 
the fsp is effective for the first reporting period beginning after april   with early adoption permitted 
as the company does not presently have the legal right to extract minerals from the mcdonald and seven up pete properties due to the i constraint  the company has not reclassified prior period amounts and will continue to amortize the carrying value of the properties until the legal impediment is resolved 
the company assesses its producing properties and undeveloped mineral claims and leases for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the properties may be impaired and at least annually 
for producing properties and equipment  an impairment is recognized when the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to result in the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on discounted cash flows 
undeveloped mineral claims and leases are measured on a fair value basis 
fair value with respect to such mineral interests  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective january   would generally be assessed with reference to comparable property sales transactions in the market place 
however  the company is pursuing litigation to overturn  modify  or exempt the application of an anti mining initiative  i  passed in montana that is restricting development of the mcdonald and seven up pete mineral properties 
as an active market for regulatory overturns or exemptions and minerals takings lawsuits does not exist  and given the multiple potential outcomes of the litigation and other actions  the use of a decision analysis technique for estimating fair value is appropriate 
this approach combines the projected monetary values rewards and losses for each of the possible material outcomes with the estimated probability of occurrence 
the expected values associated with potential property development and certain takings outcomes are estimated using the traditional net present value analysis of revenues  costs and capital investment cash flow projections discounted at a risk adjusted rate reflective of the time periods associated with each possible outcome 
other ending values related to potential takings outcomes are estimated based on takings settlements that have occurred in other market situations 
based on this approach undertaken for the company by independent consultants  management believes that a reasonable estimate of a fair value in excess of the carrying value of  at december   has been appropriately determined 
assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties 
also  the occurrence of past market transactions does not mean that such comparable amounts would be applicable to the company s situation 
any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions could have a material effect on the fair value estimate 
there is also no assurance that the company will be successful in its litigation or other actions 
the company continually monitors the status of the litigation and will adjust its assumptions as future events or other changes in circumstances occur 
the company must estimate useful lives and residual values to establish amortization amounts for the carrying values of its intangible assets 
these assets  which are comprised of the company s mcdonald and seven up pete properties  are presently legally constrained from development due to the anti mining initiative  i the company has filed lawsuits seeking to have i declared unconstitutional  or alternatively  to obtain a takings or damage award for the lost value of the properties 
the company must use considerable judgment in establishing a litigation timeline and possible monetary outcomes  and utilizes external counsel and other consultants to establish these parameters 
the company  as of january   established an amortization period of eight years applied to the carrying values of the properties 
the company  from time to time  utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate gold price risk for its operations 
these transactions are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidelines  and require the company to estimate fair values of its derivatives at each reporting date 
the unrealized gains and losses resulting from the calculations are included in net income currently  and can result in significant swings from one reporting period to the next depending on the then market price of gold 
the company must use significant judgment in assessing its ability to generate future taxable income to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets  which are principally in the form of net operating loss carryforwards and in applying a valuation allowance to all or part of these deferred tax assets using a more likely than not criterion 

table of contents the company is subject to litigation as the result of its business operations and transactions 
the company utilizes external counsel in evaluating potential exposure to adverse outcomes from judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from the company s estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause the company to revise its estimates  net income will be affected

the company appealed the action of the dnrc in an administrative hearing process and the dnrc hearing examiner affirmed the dnrc action 
it is the company s position that the permitting process has been interrupted by the threat and passage of i and  thus  the permit extension is continued until the governmental impediment is resolved

environmental regulation in  the montana state legislature passed legislation which streamlined the permitting process of new industrial projects by reorganizing the several state agencies that had jurisdiction over environmental permitting into one new central agency  the department of environmental quality deq 
this agency is responsible for acting on an application for a hard rock mining operating permit in connection with a plan of operations filed by the seven up pete joint venture for the mcdonald gold project 
this permit  as well as several other local  state and federal permits  including a joint state and federal environmental impact statement eis  will be required before permits can be issued 
there are no assurances that all permits will be issued nor that  in the event they are issued  such issuances will be timely  nor that conditions contained in the permits will not be so onerous as to preclude construction and operation of the project 
moreover  with the passage of i in november  the company cannot presently proceed with permitting and development of the mcdonald gold project 
the kendall mine operates under permits granted by the montana department of environmental quality deq 
costs incurred for reclamation and closure activities at the kendall mine in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
costs to date total million and the company s estimate of total costs to achieve mine closure is million 
the company has  on deposit in an interest bearing account with the deq for reclamation at the kendall mine 
in february  the deq issued a decision that a comprehensive environmental impact statement eis is needed for completion of reclamation at kendall 
the company s estimate to achieve mine closure could be impacted by the outcome of an agency decision following an eis 
the briggs mine operates under permits granted by various agencies including the us bureau of land management blm  inyo county  the california department of conservation  and the lahontan regional water equality control board lahontan 
these agencies have jointly required the company to post a reclamation bond in the amount of  to ensure appropriate reclamation 
additionally  the company was required by lahontan to post a  bond to ensure adequate funds to mitigate any foreseeable release of pollutants to state waters 
both bonds are subject to annual review and adjustment 
in april  the california legislature passed a bill which stipulates that  if a project is located within one mile of a native american sacred site and on limited use lands within the california desert conservation area cdca  new open pit metal mine projects must be backfilled during reclamation and any disturbances to sacred sites must be mitigated to the sole satisfaction of the native american tribe 
the company s briggs project is located in the panamint range within the designated limited use land of the cdca and the nearby timbisha shoshone native american tribe has stated that they consider the entire project area to be sacred 
the company could be prohibited from developing any additional gold deposits in the panamint range due to passage of this law 

table of contents on december   the california state mining and geology board csmgb enacted an emergency backfill regulation  for days  that essentially requires that all future metal mines be backfilled to the original contour of the landscape 
on april   the csmgb made this backfill regulation permanent 
because of the high cost of backfilling  this regulation essentially eliminates any potential new mines on the company s properties in the panamint range 
based upon current knowledge  the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations as currently promulgated 
however  the exact nature of environmental control problems  if any  which the company may encounter in the future cannot be predicted primarily because of the increasing number  complexity and changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted or of the standards being promulgated by federal and state authorities 
federal legislation legislation has been introduced in prior sessions of the united states congress to modify the requirements applicable to mining claims on federal lands under the mining law of to date  no such legislation has been enacted 
the timing and exact nature of any mining law changes cannot presently be predicted  however  the company will continue its active role in industry efforts to work with congress to achieve responsible changes to mining law 
gold prices  price protection arrangements  and associated risks the company s revenues  earnings and cash flow are strongly influenced by world gold prices  which fluctuate widely and over which the company has no control 
the company s price protection strategy is to provide an acceptable floor price for a portion of its production in order to meet minimum coverage ratios as required by loan facilities while providing participation in potentially higher prices 
production not subject to loan covenants has historically been sold at spot prices 
the risks associated with price protection arrangements include opportunity risk by limiting unilateral participation in upward prices  production risk associated with the requirement to deliver physical ounces against a forward commitment  and credit risk associated with counterparties to the hedged transaction 
the company believes its production risk is minimal  and furthermore  has the flexibility to selectively extend maturity dates on its forward commitments 
with regard to credit risk  the company uses only creditworthy counterparties and does not anticipate any non performance by such counterparties 
the company  however  could be subject to cash margin calls by its counterparties if the market price of gold significantly exceeds the forward contract price which would create additional financial obligations

the fsp was effective for the first reporting period beginning after april   with early adoption permitted 
as the company does not presently have the legal right to extract minerals from the mcdonald and seven up pete properties due to the i constraint  the company has not reclassified prior period amounts and will continue to amortize the carrying value of the properties until the legal impediment is removed 
dividends since the company s inception  no cash dividends have been paid 
for the foreseeable future  it is anticipated that the company will use any earnings to finance its growth and that dividends will not be paid to shareholders 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices the company s earnings and cash flow are significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold 
gold prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  such as demand  production levels  economic policies of central banks  producer hedging  and the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
during the last five years  the average annual market price has fluctuated between per ounce and per ounce 
as of december   the company had outstanding floating forward gold contracts on  ounces at an average price of per ounce  approximately of anticipated production in a floating rate forward contract allows the company the flexibility to i deliver gold and receive the contract price if the market price is below the contract price or ii extend the maturity date of the forward contract and sell at the market price if the contract price is below the market price 
there are certain market risks associated with the forward gold contracts utilized by the company 
if the company s counterparties fail to honor their contractual obligation to purchase gold at agreed upon prices  the company may be exposed to market price risk by having to sell gold in the open market at prevailing prices 
similarly  if the company fails to produce sufficient quantities of gold to meet its forward commitments  the company would have to purchase the shortfall in the open market at prevailing prices 
in addition  the company could be subject to cash margin calls by counterparties if the market price of gold significantly exceeds the forward contract price which would create additional financial obligations 
at december   the company had no outstanding forward gold contracts 
at december   the fair value of the company s forward gold contracts was approximately million less than contractual amounts 
interest rates at december   the company s debt was approximately million  which relates to its convertible debentures 
thus  the company is not presently subject to interest rate risk 
foreign currency the price of gold is denominated in us dollars  and the company s gold production operations are in the united states 
the company conducts only a minor amount of exploration activity in foreign countries and has minimal foreign currency exposure
