item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview pelican financial currently serves as the holding company of pelican national and until the distribution on december   washtenaw mortgage company 
pelican financial s operations involved both mortgage banking and retail banking  but will focus on retail banking in the future 
the mortgage banking segment involved the origination and purchase of single family residential mortgage loans in approximately states  the sale of these loans  usually on a pooled and securitized basis  in the secondary market  and the servicing of mortgage loans for investors 
the retail banking segment involves attracting deposits from the general public and using these funds to originate consumer  commercial  commercial real estate  residential construction  and single family residential mortgage loans  from its six offices in naples  fort myers  bonita springs and cape coral  florida 
pelican financial s earnings are primarily dependent upon three sources net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  fee income from customers  and gains realized on sales of loans 
these revenues are in turn significantly affected by factors such as changes in prevailing interest rates and in the yield curve that is  the difference between prevailing short term and long term interest rates 
the earnings performance of the continuing operations of pelican financial is a concern to management 
management is attempting to improve this by a variety of factors including liquidity management  cross selling of products and managing operating expenses 
management is also focusing on increasing core deposits to allow the opportunity to cross sell other products and services 
as part of this objective  pelican national has aggressively marketed a money market deposit account in its local markets during the first nine months of the year 
during the fourth quarter  management decided to reduce the interest rate being paid on the money market accounts in an effort to increase its interest margin 
this resulted in larger than projected withdrawals during the fourth quarter 
furthermore  washtenaw transferred all of its custodial account balances out of pelican national in december as a result of these two events  pelican national borrowed additional money from the federal home loan bank 
pelican national intends to replace the borrowing with traditional core deposits over time depending on its capital and liquidity position 
spin off on december   pelican financial distributed all of the outstanding shares of the washtenaw group  inc to the holders of pelican financial common stock on a share for share basis based on pelican financial shareholders of record on december  
upon completion of the distribution on december   washtenaw is no longer a subsidiary of pelican financial 
following the distribution certain individuals will serve as officers of both washtenaw and pelican financial 
washtenaw will pay their salaries and all other compensation 
pelican financial will reimburse washtenaw  as part of a transitional services agreement the tsa  for time spent on pelican financial matters 
prior to the distribution  pelican did not reimburse washtenaw for these services 
after the distribution  officers and other employees providing services to both companies will be required to maintain records of their time spent on the affairs of each company as a basis for determining the reimbursements 
intercompany transactions during the periods covered  pelican national entered into various transactions with washtenaw mortgage  which is affiliated by common ownership 
the washtenaw group  inc  wholly owns washtenaw mortgage 
these transactions were primarily the sale of loans  the servicing of loans  the establishment of custodial accounts on deposit and borrowings 
during the year ended december   pelican financial paid washtenaw  as part of the tsa 
prior to the distribution  pelican did not reimburse washtenaw for these services 
during the years ended december   and  washtenaw sold loans to pelican national totaling   and zero 
the sales were executed at current market prices  and resulted in a gain of   and zero to washtenaw  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  pelican national paid servicing and loan underwriting fees to washtenaw of   and  washtenaw established and maintained escrow and custodial funds aggregating approximately zero   and  at pelican national at december   and these custodial funds are not assets of washtenaw  but are deposits of pelican national and are included in the consolidated financial statements 
pelican national paid no interest income on these funds in the periods presented 
pelican national provided a secured borrowing for a portion of washtenaw s loans held for sale in the outstanding balances at december  was  during the year ended december   washtenaw paid pelican national bank  in related interest income 
at december   washtenaw was a guarantor on the loan for pelican financial in the amount of  the guaranty was secured by a blanket pledge of the servicing portfolio 
the loan was paid in full in january technology pelican national tries to offer its customers and employees the best available solutions in technology in a cost effective manner 
during  the following significant projects were completed continued upgrades to various internal networks to allow for improved reliability and security of internal systems 
expanded feature functionality of electronic banking to include electronic presentment options as required by check completed integration of baker hill and laser pro loan processing packages with existing mainframe applications to improve lending efficiency 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estmates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policy that has the greatest impact on the pelican financial s financial condition and results of operations and that require the most judgment relates to its accounting for the allowance for loan losses 
the discontinued operations critical accounting policies involved accounting for gains on sales of loans and mortgage servicing rights msr  valuation and amortization of msrs  accounting for derivatives and interest rate risk management activities  and accounting for litigation and claims against the company 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of credit losses incurred in pelican financial s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the pelican financial s control 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance relies on several key elements  which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  general allocations for graded loans  and general allocations based on historical trends for pools of similar un graded loans 
specific allowances are established in cases where senior credit management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
the specific allowance is determined by methods prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
a general allocation on commercial and commercial real estate loans not considered impaired is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk grade of such loans 
loans are assigned a loss allocation factor for each loan classification category 
the lower the grading assigned to a loan category  the greater the allocation percentage that is applied 
changes in risk grade of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the allocation 
loss factors are based on our loss experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the analysis date 
groups of homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate and consumer loans  receive an allowance allocation based on loss trends 
we use historical loss trends based on our experience in determining an adequate allowance for these pools of loans 
general economic and business conditions  credit quality trends  seasoning of the portfolios and recent loss experience are conditions considered in connection with allocation factors for these similar pools of loans 
discontinued operations critical accounting policies gain on sale of loans and mortgage servicing rights the discontinued operation of washtenaw mortgage securitized substantially all of the mortgage loans it produced in exchange for all of the beneficial interests in the resulting securities  and then sold those securities on a regular basis in the secondary mortgage market 
by products of those securitizations are msrs which were generally either held as long term investments or sold immediately 
loans held for sale were carried at the lower of cost or fair value  in aggregate 
fair value was based on outstanding sales commitment prices for the related loans or stated market prices for similar loans in normal market outlets used by washtenaw 
msrs were included in the carrying value of loans held for sale until the sale of loans on a servicing retained basis  at which time the servicing rights were established as a separate asset 
gains or losses realized on loan sales were recorded at the settlement date  which was the date the sales price is received and control of the loan had been surrendered to the buyer 
gains or losses realized on the sale of servicing rights were recorded when title and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer  and any protection provisions retained by washtenaw such as refunding sales premiums upon prepayment of the related loans within days of sale were minor and can be reasonably estimated 
while pelican financial will continue to sell mortgage loans  this will be done on a whole loan basis under best efforts agreements 
mortgage servicing rights msr valuation msrs were recorded based on the present value of the right to service loans in a portfolio 
the valuation of msrs requires that we make estimates of numerous market assumptions 
prepayment speeds  servicing costs  discount rates  and the payment performance of the underlying loans significantly affects our ongoing valuations and the rate of amortization of msrs 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
impairment valuations are performed by the washtenaw mortgage using a discounted cash flow model and market assumptions 
washtenaw mortgage validated the results of the discounted cash flow model by obtaining regular independent valuations of washtenaw mortgage s msrs and by reference to washtenaw mortgage s on going experience with sales of msrs 
independent valuations were obtained at least annually  and generally two to four times per year 
the recorded values of the msrs were amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the anticipated net cash flows from servicing the loans 
msrs were assessed periodically to determine if there had been any impairment to the recorded balance  based on the fair value at the date of the assessment and by stratifying the msrs based on underlying loan characteristics  including loan type  term  interest rate and the year of capitalization 
the most significant assumption we used to value mortgage servicing rights was prepayment rate 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates  and actual prepayments generally differ from our initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates were different than we originally estimated  we may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights 
we periodically evaluated our msrs for impairment  which was measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value of each stratum of msr 
in the event of impairment  the adjustment was recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
other assumptions  including discount rates and loan servicing costs  were used to estimate the fair value of msrs 
these assumptions do not generally fluctuate from period to period to the same degree as prepayment rates  and the fair value of msrs was less sensitive to changes in these assumptions 
pelican financial does not anticipate recording additional msrs in the future 
the remaining servicing rights relate to marine loans that were sold with servicing retained 
in the future  pelican national anticipates that marine loans will be sold as whole loans or placed in the portfolio 
derivatives and interest rate risk management activities the discontinued operation utilized derivatives extensively in connection with its interest rate risk management activities 
washtenaw mortgage was exposed to interest rate risk on loans held for sale and the pipeline of loans in process 
as market rates increase or decrease  the market value of loans held for sale and loans in process will decline or increase 
to offset this interest rate risk  washtenaw mortgage entered into derivatives  including us treasury options and forward contracts to deliver loans and mortgage backed securities 
in accordance with sfas  all derivative instruments were recorded at fair value 
accordingly  us treasury options and forward contracts were carried at fair value  as determined by the amount payable or receivable to from the counterparty as if the derivatives were settled at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the forward sales contracts and us treasury options are based on the end of the period pricing from bloomberg 
washtenaw mortgage may have qualified for hedge accounting under sfas with regard to its interest rate risk management activities for loans held for sale 
to qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  washtenaw mortgage had to demonstrate  on an ongoing basis  that its interest rate risk management activity was highly effective 
if washtenaw was unable to qualify certain of its interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting  then the change in fair value of the associated derivative financial instruments was reflected in current period earnings  but the change in fair value of the related loans held for sale may not  thus creating an earnings mismatch 
however  if the activity is highly effective  the change in fair value of the hedged loans held for sale is recorded in earnings  which partially offsets the change in value of the derivatives and thereby reduces the net effect on earnings 
management tested and documented the effectiveness of these hedging activities on a quarterly basis  by documenting that the change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged loans move in opposite directions within a similar proportion as defined in sfas in connection with its pipeline of loans in process  washtenaw mortgage issued interest rate lock commitments irlcs to loan applicants and financial intermediaries 
the irlcs guarantee the loan terms for a period of time while the application is in process  primarily between five and days 
irlcs are derivative instruments as defined by sfas and  therefore  were required to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in current period earnings 
changes in the fair value of irlcs will move in the opposite direction and will partially offset changes in the fair value of us treasury options and forward contracts 
however  unlike washtenaw mortgage s other derivative instruments  there is no active market for irlcs that can be used to determine an irlc s fair value 
consequently  washtenaw mortgage has developed a methodology for estimating the fair value of its irlcs 
washtenaw mortgage estimated the fair value of an irlc based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan  given the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is based upon quoted secondary market prices and is measured from the lock date 
therefore  at the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an irlc is zero 
subsequent to issuance  the value of an irlc can be either positive or negative  depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan 
the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc is driven by a number of factors  in particular  the change  if any  in mortgage rates subsequent to the lock date 
in general  the probability increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant s committed rate 
the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the irlc also is influenced by the source of the applications  age of the applications and purpose of the loans purchase or refinance 
washtenaw mortgage has developed closing ratio estimates fallout curves using its historical empirical data that take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
the fallout curves are utilized to estimate the quantity of loans that will fund within the terms of the irlcs 
since the us treasury options and forward commitments were used to manage the interest rate risk exposure of loans held for sale and irlcs  it was generally expected that the fluctuations in fair value of the various derivatives and effectively hedged loans will largely  though not entirely  offset so that the net effect on earnings is not material 
however  the net effect on earnings was dependent on the effectiveness of hedging activities and a variety of other factors  including market interest rate volatility  actual fallout rates  the ability to fill the forward contracts before expiration  and the time period required to close and sell loans 
pelican financial does not currently  or have any plans to  use derivative instruments to hedge its interest rate risk 
litigation and claims washtenaw mortgage is subject to contingent liabilities  including judicial and arbitration proceedings  and other claims arising from the conduct of our business activities 
reserves are established for legal and other claims when it becomes probable that we will incur an expense and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we involve internal and external experts  including attorneys  in assessing probability and in estimating any amounts involved 
throughout the life of a contingency  we or our experts may learn of additional information that can impact our assessments about probability or about the estimates of amounts involved and changes in these assessments can lead to changes in recorded reserves 
in addition  the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for those claims 
management does not believe there are presently significant probable losses beyond attorney fees  which are expensed as the legal services are performed 
though pelican financial is subject to contingent liabilities  including judicial and arbitration proceedings  and other claims arising from the conduct of our business activities  historically the significant litigation and claims of the company were attributable to operations of washtenaw mortgage 
financial condition general 
at december   total assets were million compared to million at december  management is committed to growing the balance sheet with quality assets that provide the appropriate yields 
the following is a discussion of the significant fluctuations between the december  and balance sheets 
assets cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease of million or was primarily the result of washtenaw removing all of the investor accounts related to its servicing portfolio at pelican national 
the balances at december  related to washtenaw s servicing portfolio was million 
this was offset by a money market deposit program pelican national bank began offering in august  that has raised the amount of core deposits at pelican national 
in addition  two additional branches were opened  which also increased overall deposits 
securities available for sale securities available for sale were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million or was primarily the result of pelican national s ability to invest its deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings in higher yielding securities as opposed to federal funds sold 
this is due to a more stable deposit base after the withdrawal of the deposits from washtenaw which were very volatile throughout each month 
loans receivable 
total portfolio loans were million at december   an increase of million from at december  this lack of change in the portfolio resulted primarily from an increase in installment loan and residential real estate lending production at pelican national and offset by a reduction in the commercial real estate portfolio and loans being paid in full 
pelican national has had difficulty finding quality loan officers in its market 
as a result  with the exception of marine lending  overall new loan originations have not changed significantly 
management intends to more aggressively pursue obtaining quality loans through purchases from other financial institutions 
other real estate owned 
other real estate owned decreased to zero at december  this was a decrease of approximately  compared to december  the decrease is related to the sale of existing foreclosures from the prior year and a lack of any significant foreclosure activity during the year ended december  premises and equipment 
premises and equipment increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase was the result of opening two additional branches and the related capital expenditures including land  buildings and equipment 
liabilities deposits 
total deposits were million at december  compared to million at december   representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease was the result of washtenaw mortgage removing all of the investor accounts related to its loan servicing portfolio at pelican national 
this was offset by the opening of two additional branches and a focus on developing new deposit relationships with customers 
this was achieved by increasing the yield paid on money market accounts to one of the highest in the local market area at various times during the year 
in addition  the newest branches opened in had collected approximately million in deposits as of december  pelican national continues to reduce its reliance on certificates of deposits obtained from brokers and the internet 
pelican national is allowing all certificates of deposits obtained in this manner to mature without replacing the funds 
at december  and  there were and million in deposits obtained from brokers and the internet 
federal home loan bank borrowings 
during the year  federal home loan bank borrowings increased from million to million at december  the increase of million was due to washtenaw withdrawing its deposits in december pelican national borrowed the additional funds from the federal home loan bank on a short term basis until it is able to replace the washtenaw deposits with core deposits 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
pelican financial s net loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december l  and was  and  the decreased loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the decrease in provision for loan losses offset by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in net interest income 
pelican financial s net loss for the year ended december l  was  compared to earnings of million for the year ended december  the decrease is the result of million in net income for the year ended december  contributed from discontinued operations 
net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or approximately 
the decrease is due to the reduction in net interest margin 
the reduction in net interest margin is due to higher yielding loans paying in full and being replaced by lower yielding loans and investment securities 
also  the average balance in noninterest bearing demand deposits decreased which attributed to a higher cost of funds  despite the decrease in cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities 
average balance sheet 
the following table contains for the periods indicated information regarding the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resulting average costs  net interest income  and the net yield on interest earning assets

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management 
during the year ended december   management reversed the provision for loan losses by  compared to a provision of  for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses as of december  was  or of total portfolio loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level based upon our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance relies on several key elements  which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  general allocations for graded loans  and general allocations based on historical trends for pools of similar un graded loans 
specific allowances are established in cases where senior credit management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired

we use historical loss trends based on our experience in determining an adequate allowance for these pools of loans 
general economic and business conditions  credit quality trends  seasoning of the portfolios and recent loss experience are conditions considered in connection with allocation factors for these similar pools of loans 
during the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses decreased by  the decrease was largely due to a reduction in the specific allowance on impaired loans reviewed by the bank 
criticized assets decreased from million at december  to million at december  these loans represent loans with one or more underwriting deficiencies as identified by bank management or the bank s regulatory agency 
management is in the process of corrective actions on the criticized loans in an effort to improve the rating on the criticized assets 
criticized assets may or may not be delinquent 
noninterest income 
noninterest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is due to the increase in gain on sale of securities to  from a  loss and the increase net gain on foreclosed assets and other income to  from a  loss 
this was offset by a decrease in the gain on sale of loans from  to  the increase in the gain on sale of securities resulted from the favorable market conditions at the time the securities were sold for liquidity purposes 
the decrease in gain on sale loans resulted from the reduction in the sales of marine loans during compensation and employee benefits expense 
compensation and benefits totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately  or 
the expense in was partially the result of a one time   severance payment to the previous president of pelican national 
as a result  the increase in continuing operational costs was approximately  these costs increased primarily from the opening of two additional branches during the first six months of occupancy and equipment expense 
occupancy and equipment expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to pelican national opening two bank branches during and the full year of expenses incurred related to the branches opened in legal 
legal expenses decreased to  compared to  for the years ended december  and the decrease is primarily due to the expenses related to various legal requirements and issues involved in the spin off of washtenaw mortgage during accounting and auditing 
accounting and auditing expenses were  compared to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to the expenses related to various audit work involved in the spin off of washtenaw mortgage during offset by small increases in the annual internal and external audit fees 
data processing 
data processing expense increased to  compared to  for the years ended december  and the increase is due to the increased costs on the core systems contract due to the additional depositor relationships established during marketing and advertising 
marketing and advertising expenses decreased to  compared to  for the years ended december  and the reduction in expenditures was due to reduced advertising and the use of lower cost alternatives 
loan and other real estate owned 
loan and other real estate owned expenses decreased to  compared to  for the years ended december  and this is due to reduced costs associated with foreclosures and repossessions in debt extinguishments 
debt extinguishments expenses decreased from  to zero for the years ended december  and the decrease represents pre payment penalties for the pay off prior to maturity of million in federal home loan bank borrowings in this was done to reduce pelican national s excess liquidity and to eliminate debt with rates above current market rates 
the weighted average interest rate on the two paid off notes was 
other noninterest expense 
other noninterest expenses increased to million compared to  for the years ended december  and the increase is due to the additional branches and employees added during provision for income taxes 
for the years ended december  and  the provision for income taxes was a benefit of  compared to  a difference of  between the comparable periods 
the decrease was due to the reduced pre tax loss in the effective tax rate for both periods was constant at approximately 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
pelican financial s net loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december l  was  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease of approximately million for the year ended december  was primarily the result of increases in provision for loan losses and noninterest expense 
pelican financial s net income for the year ended december l  was million compared to for the year ended december  the increase is the result of a million increase in income from discontinued operations resulting from a decrease in mortgage servicing right valuation adjustments and increase in loan originations related to the discontinued operations 
net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or approximately 
the consistency in dollar amount is due to the reduction in interest rate earned on earning assets being offset by an increase in the average balance outstanding of earning assets and a reduction in the cost of funds 
the reduction in the cost of funds is due to a change in composition of deposit with a greater reliance in on money markets as compared to certificates of deposits which typically have a higher cost 
in addition  the certificates of deposits that matured in were typically replaced with lower yielding alternatives 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses as of december  was million  or of total portfolio loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  during the year ended december  the provision for loan losses increased by  the increase in the provision was deemed necessary despite the decrease in nonperforming loans  due to an increase in loans requiring specific allowances and an increase in the allowance allocation on the marine lending portfolio and a portfolio of loans located in inner city areas 
net charge offs for the year ended december  totaled  as compared to  for the same period in the increase in net charge offs was due to the deterioration of several impaired loans 
these loans are located in inner city areas where the overall neighborhoods are declining 
several of these loans were made to one borrower who has declared bankruptcy  which has delayed collection efforts 
the increase in net charge offs also increased the historical loss rates used to calculate the allowance allocation for homogeneous loans 
this had the most significant impact on the marine lending portfolio and the loans remaining from a pool of purchased inner city residential mortgage loans 
the specific allocations on certain loans  including a portion of the pool of inner city residential mortgage loans  increased during the periods due to a decrease in the value of the collateral 
in addition  the principal balance of loans requiring specific allocations increased during noninterest income 
noninterest income totaled  for the year end december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the decrease in gain on sale of securities from  to a  loss  the decrease in the gain on sales msrs and loans from  to  and the decrease in other income from a  gain to a  loss 
the decrease in the gain on sale of securities resulted from the unfavorable market conditions at the time the securities were sold for liquidity purposes 
the decrease in gain on sales of mortgage servicing rights and loans  net resulted from the reduction in the sales of marine loans during other income decreased primarily due to the loss on the disposition of real estate owned and boat repossessions 
compensation and employee benefits expense 
compensation and benefits totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately million or 
the increase during was partially the result of a  severance payment to the previous president of pelican national 
in addition  pelican national s third branch was open for the entire year and the fourth branch opened in the spring of these costs may continue to increase due the scheduled opening of two additional branches during the first six months of occupancy and equipment expense 
occupancy and equipment expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to pelican national opening a third bank branch during the fourth quarter of  as well as opening a fourth branch in the spring of these costs may continue to increase due to the scheduled opening of two additional branches during the first six months of legal

fas  revised  requires all public companies to record compensation cost for stock options provided to employees in return for employee service 
the cost is measured at the fair value of the options when granted  and this cost is expensed over the employee service period  which is normally the vesting period of the options 
this will apply to awards granted or modified after the first quarter or year beginning after june  compensation cost will also be recorded for prior option grants that vest after the date of adoption 
the effect on results of operations will depend on the level of future option grants and the calculation of the fair value of the options granted at such future date  as well as the vesting periods provided  and so cannot currently be predicted 
existing options that will vest after adoption date are expected to result in additional compensation expense of approximately  during the balance of   in   in   in and  in there will be no significant effect on financial position  as total equity will not change

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of pelican financial s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of pelican financial are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on pelican financial s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal objective of pelican financial s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given pelican financial s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with pelican financial s interest rate risk management policy 
through this management  pelican financial seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors of pelican financial is responsible for reviewing asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
the board of directors reviews the interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis 
in connection with this review  the board of directors evaluates pelican financial s business activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on pelican financial s net interest margin  the market value of the loan  servicing  and securities portfolios  and the effect the changes in interest rates will have on pelican financial s loan  servicing  and securities portfolios and exposure limits 
the continuous movement of interest rates is certain  however  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movements in interest rates has an effect on pelican financial s profitability 
the value of loans  which pelican financial has either originated or purchased or committed to originate or purchase  decreases as interest rates rise and conversely  the value increases as interest rates fall 
pelican financial also faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as loans and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
pelican financial s interest rate spread and interest margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
pelican financial s interest margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
the overall objective of pelican financial s interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
pelican financial does not speculate on the direction of interest rates in its management of interest rate risk
