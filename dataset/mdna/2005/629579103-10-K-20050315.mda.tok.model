and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data overview nacco industries  inc nacco  the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  the company operate in three principal industries lift trucks  housewares and mining 
results of operations and financial condition are discussed separately by segment  which corresponds with the industry groupings 
the company manages its lift truck operations as two reportable segments wholesale manufacturing and retail distribution 
the housewares group also consists of two reportable segments hamilton beach proctor silex  inc and the kitchen collection  inc 
results by segment are also summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this form k 
nmhg holding co  through its wholly owned subsidiary  nacco materials handling group  inc collectively nmhg designs  engineers  manufactures  sells  services and leases a comprehensive line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts marketed globally under the hyster and yale brand names 
nmhg manages its operations as two reportable segments wholesale manufacturing nmhg wholesale and retail distribution nmhg retail 
nmhg wholesale includes the manufacture and sale of lift trucks and related service parts  primarily to independent and wholly owned hyster and yale retail dealerships 
lift trucks and component parts are manufactured in the united states  mexico  brazil  northern ireland  scotland  the netherlands  italy  china  japan  and the philippines 
nmhg retail includes the sale  leasing and service of hyster and yale lift trucks and related service parts by wholly owned retail dealerships and rental companies 
nacco housewares group housewares consists of two reportable segments hamilton beach proctor silex  inc hb ps and the kitchen collection  inc 
kci 
hb ps is a leading designer  manufacturer  importer and marketer of small electric kitchen and household appliances  as well as commercial products for restaurants  bars and hotels located throughout the united states  canada and mexico 
kci is a national specialty retailer of brand name kitchenware  small electric appliances and related accessories with stores located throughout the united states 
the north american coal corporation  and its affiliated coal companies collectively nacoal mine and market lignite coal primarily as fuel for power generation and provide selected value added mining services for other natural resources companies in the united states 
lignite coal is delivered to adjacent power plants from nacoal s mines in north dakota  texas  louisiana and mississippi 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities if any 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product discounts and returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  product liabilities  restructuring  closed mine obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product liabilities the company provides for the estimated cost of personal and property damage relating to the company s products 
reserves are recorded for estimates of the costs for known claims and estimates of the costs of incidents that have occurred but for which a claim has not yet been reported to the company  in excess of available insurance coverage 
while the company engages in extensive product quality reviews and customer education programs  the company s product liability provision is affected by the number and magnitude of claims of alleged product related damage and the cost to defend those claims 
in addition  the provision for product liabilities is also affected by changes in assumptions for medical costs  inflation rates  trends in damages awarded by juries and estimates of the number of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
changes to the estimate of any of these factors could result in a material change to the company s product liability provision causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
closed mine obligations the company s wholly owned subsidiary  bellaire corporation bellaire  is a non operating subsidiary with legacy liabilities relating to closed mining operations  primarily former eastern us underground mining operations 
these legacy liabilities include obligations for black lung and other retiree medical benefits  mine water treatment and obligations to the united mine workers of america umwa combined benefit fund the fund arising as a result of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act 
provisions made by bellaire for these liabilities include estimates of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire  medical cost trend rates  inflation rates  actuarially determined mortality tables  cost of ongoing mine water treatment  discount factors and legal costs to defend claims 
in addition  these liabilities can be influenced by judicial 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data proceedings  legislative actions and changes in regulations made by government agencies 
the company continually monitors the regulatory climate which could influence these liabilities as well as the assumptions used to develop accruals for these liabilities 
changes in any of these factors could materially change the company s estimates for these closed mine obligations causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion of closed mine obligations 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
changes in management s judgments and estimates could significantly affect the company s analysis of the impairment of goodwill 
to test goodwill for impairment  the company is required to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units 
since quoted market prices in an active market are not available for the company s reporting units  the company uses other valuation techniques 
the company has developed a model to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  primarily incorporating a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
this model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used to discount those estimated cash flows 
changes to these judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title transfers and risk of loss passes as customer orders are completed and shipped 
for nmhg s national account customers  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance 
under its mining contracts  the company recognizes revenue as the coal is delivered and limerock is mined 
reserves for discounts  returns and product warranties are maintained for anticipated future claims 
the accounting policies used to develop these product discounts  returns and warranties include product discounts the company records estimated reductions to revenues for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price competition  promotions and other volume based incentives 
at nmhg  truck sales revenue is recorded net of projected discounts 
the estimated discount amount is based upon historical trends for each truck model 
in addition to standard discounts  dealers can also request additional discounts that allow them to offer price concessions to customers 
from time to time  nmhg offers special incentives to increase retail share or dealer stock and offers certain customers volume rebates if a specified cumulative level of purchases is obtained 
at hb ps  net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns and allowances for defective products 
at kci  retail markdowns are incorporated into kci s retail method of accounting for cost of sales 
if market conditions were to decline or if competition was to increase  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
product returns products generally are not sold with the right of return 
however  based on the company s historical experience  a portion of products sold are estimated to be returned due to reasons such as buyer remorse  duplicate gifts received  product failure and excess inventory stocked by the customer which  subject to certain terms and conditions  the company will agree to accept 
the company records estimated reductions to revenues at the time of sale based on this historical experience and the limited right of return provided to certain customers 
if future trends were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions to revenues may result based on this new experience 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  labor costs and replacement component costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  labor costs or replacement component costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which would affect net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory to the lower of cost or market  which includes an estimate for obsolescence or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory  the corresponding reserve for impaired value is relieved to ensure that the cost basis of the inventory reflects any write downs 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data deferred tax valuation allowances the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
a valuation allowance has been provided against certain deferred tax assets related to non us and non us state jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards 
management believes the reserves are adequate after considering future taxable income  allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
american jobs creation act of the company does not provide taxes on undistributed foreign earnings which are considered to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 
at the present time  the company has not completed the process of reevaluating its position with respect to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings taking into account the effects of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
internal revenue code section the dividend exclusion  enacted as part of the jobs act in october  is a temporary provision that allows us companies to repatriate earnings from their non us subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate provided that certain specified conditions and restrictions are satisfied 
the dividend exclusion provisions provide that us companies may elect  for one taxable year  an dividends received deduction for eligible dividends received from their non us subsidiaries effectively reducing the rate of us tax on such earnings 
the company continues to monitor the evolving guidance in this area and has modeled its effects based upon the current available guidance as issued by the treasury department and the internal revenue service as well as the proposed resolutions to some computational issues for which direct guidance has not yet been published 
the company is awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance or statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions of the dividend exclusion prior to determining the amount  if any  of the qualifying dividend to be paid 
at the present time  the company is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings under the dividend exclusion provisions of the jobs act  and if so  the amount that will be repatriated 
the company s best estimate of the range of possible amounts that may be repatriated subject to the dividend exclusion provisions is to million upon which the estimated range of tax expense would be to million  under the current available guidance 
the company expects to complete its evaluation related to the possible repatriation of foreign earnings during self insurance liabilities the company is generally self insured for product liability  environmental liability  medical and workers compensation claims  certain closed mine liabilities and obligations to the fund arising as a result of the coal act 
an estimated provision for claims reported and for claims incurred but not yet reported under the self insurance programs is recorded and revised periodically based on industry trends  historical experience and management judgment 
in addition  industry trends are considered within management s judgment for valuing claims 
changes in assumptions for such matters as legal judgments and settlements  legal defense costs  inflation rates  medical costs and actual experience could cause estimates to change in the near term 
for product liability  catastrophic coverage is retained for potentially significant individual claims 
retirement benefit plans the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans 
pension benefits for certain nacoal employees  excluding certain unconsolidated project mining subsidiary employees  were frozen effective december  in  pension benefits were frozen for employees covered under nmhg s and hb ps us defined benefit plans  except for those nmhg employees participating in collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  as of january   in the united states only certain nmhg employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will earn retirement benefits under defined benefit pension plans 
other employees of the company  including employees whose pension benefits were frozen  will receive retirement benefits under defined contribution retirement plans 
the company s policy is to periodically make contributions to fund these plans within the range allowed by applicable regulations 
plan assets consist primarily of publicly traded stocks  investment contracts and government and corporate bonds 
there is no guarantee that the actual return on the plans assets will equal the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or that the plans will not incur investment losses 
the expected long term rate of return on defined benefit plan assets reflects management s expectations of long term rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations 
the company has established the expected long term rate of return assumption for plan assets by considering 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data historical rates of return over a period of time that is consistent with the long term nature of the underlying obligations of these plans 
the historical rates of return for each of the asset classes used by the company to determine its estimated rate of return assumption at its september measurement date were based upon the rates of return earned by investments in the equivalent benchmark market indices for each of the asset classes over the time period from january  to september  and during periods of both significant market gains as well as depressed market returns  the company has held to a consistent expected rate of return assumption 
the us defined benefit plans maintain an investment policy that  among other things  establishes a portfolio asset allocation methodology with percentage allocation bands for individual asset classes 
this investment policy states that the plans invest from to in equity securities and from to in fixed income securities 
the investment policy further divides investments in equity securities among separate allocation bands for equities of large cap companies  equities of medium and small cap companies and equities of non us companies 
the investment policy provides that investments are reallocated between asset classes as balances exceed or fall below the appropriate allocation bands 
allocation between equity and debt securities varies by plan in countries outside the united states  but all plans assets are broadly diversified both domestically and internationally 
the company also maintains health care and life insurance plans which provide benefits to eligible retired employees 
due to the significantly rising costs associated with these plans  during nacoal announced a change in eligibility requirements  generally limiting the plan to those hired before january   changing the retirement age and years of service requirements for retiree medical coverage  and implementing a cap on nacoal s share of annual medical costs  effective december   which includes freezing benefits for those hired before january  all other health care and life insurance plans of the company previously implemented a cap on the company s share of the costs 
the plans have no assets 
under the company s current policy  plan benefits are funded at the time they are due to participants 
assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects at december  percentage point percentage point increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on postretirement benefit obligation see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion of the company s retirement benefit plans

and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data nacco materials handling group overview nmhg designs  engineers  manufactures  sells  services and leases a comprehensive line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts marketed globally under the hyster and yale brand names 
the company manages its operations as two reportable segments nmhg wholesale and nmhg retail 
nmhg wholesale includes the manufacture and sale of lift trucks and related service parts  primarily to independent and wholly owned hyster and yale retail dealerships 
nmhg retail includes the sale  leasing and service of hyster and yale lift trucks and related service parts by wholly owned retail dealerships and rental companies 
nmhg retail includes the elimination of intercompany revenues and profits resulting from sales by nmhg wholesale to nmhg retail 
demand for lift trucks is cyclical and depends upon capital budgeting in a variety of end markets where lift trucks are sold 
nmhg believes its market  like the broader global economy  has begun to recover and is poised for further growth 
in order to streamline manufacturing processes and transfer processes and sourcing to low cost locations  nmhg developed and implemented global restructuring programs during the past few years  which included the closure of assembly facilities  labor and overhead reductions and restructuring of its owned dealers 
these programs have reduced and will continue to reduce costs and more closely align operations with the demand for products and services  while maintaining substantially the same lift truck production capacity in fewer facilities 
in addition to the global restructuring programs  nmhg has undertaken other global programs to reduce costs  while improving the quality of its products in order to take advantage of opportunities in its markets 
nmhg s quality improvement program has focused on improving quality in all aspects of its business  including specific programs to enhance reliability  improve vendor and plant quality and reduce warranty costs 
along with its programs to reduce costs and improve quality  nmhg has continued to focus on growth opportunities through developing new products  expanding its national and global accounts and strengthening its dealer network 
nmhg continuously strives to improve its product offerings by the development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
included in current product development activities is the development of a new series of to ton internal combustion engine lift trucks  which represents one of the most significant product development projects in nmhg s history 
global and national accounts programs focus on large customers with centralized purchasing but geographically diverse operations and offer these customers the ability to purchase equipment directly from nmhg while receiving service and support from its dealer network 
nmhg continues to develop its worldwide network of owned and independent dealers as a critical component of its growth strategy 
nmhg believes these cost reduction  quality improvement and growth programs have positioned nmhg to take advantage of the continuing recovery in the capital goods market  and will result in reduced fixed overhead costs  lower manufacturing costs and improvements in both gross margins and operating profit 
some savings are volume sensitive and the program benefits are based on future unit volume levels that are consistent with historical industry demand cycle patterns 
if future industry demand levels are lower than historical industry demand cycles would indicate  or if on going operating costs  including material costs  are higher than projected  the actual annual savings and benefits from these programs could be lower than anticipated

the settlement was an award for  which was held by us customs until pending a legal review  that nmhg was due as a successor to the original claimant 
nmhg was advised that it was the proper recipient and the funds were released during income from unconsolidated affiliates increased in compared with primarily due to improved operating results at both of the company s equity method joint ventures  sumitomo nacco materials handling group  ltd sn and nmhg financial services  inc nfs 
the increase in over was the result of two adjustments to the value of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which totaled million 
a million write down was recorded in for an other than temporary decline in the value of a preferred stock investment in a us dealer accounted for under the cost method 
as a result of significant losses in and at the dealer and the uncertainty concerning the dealer s future financial performance  it was determined that the investment had suffered an other than temporary impairment 
accordingly  the company recorded a write down of its investment for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment 
no other significant losses are anticipated as a result of this investment 
additionally  in  the company recorded a million impairment charge against its investment related to a interest in the equity of an unconsolidated parts distributor in australia 
in the third quarter of  an independent third party purchased the remaining of the equity of the distributor 
based on the purchase price paid for the remaining  nmhg determined that its investment was impaired and  thus  recorded an impairment charge of million 
subsequently  in the fourth quarter of  nmhg sold its investment in the parts distributor to the owner 
no significant additional loss was recorded at the time of the sale 
the losses on interest rate swap agreements of million in and million in compared with million in is primarily due to the recognition of the ineffective portion of interest rate swap agreements which no longer qualified for hedge accounting as a result of the refinancing of nmhg s debt in may all of nmhg s interest rate swap agreements were terminated prior to december  see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion

additionally  revenues from parts sales increased primarily in the americas due mainly to higher volume 
the overall increase in revenues was also favorably affected from translating sales in foreign currencies to us dollars primarily due to the strength of the british pound sterling and the euro against the dollar

higher standard margins  primarily due to an increase in revenues as discussed above  were more than offset by higher cost of sales  including a million increase in material costs  primarily the commodity cost of steel  in the americas and europe 
nmhg wholesale s operating results benefited from the temporary suspension of fees charged by nacco for a portion of that benefit was more than offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher employee related expenses in the americas and europe and higher marketing expenses in europe

the reduced income tax provision was due to lower pre tax profit as well as a decline in nmhg wholesale s effective tax rate as previously discussed 
backlog nmhg wholesale s worldwide backlog level increased to  units at december  compared with  units at december  and decreased from  units at september  the increase from was primarily due to increased global demand for lift trucks 
the decline from september  was primarily attributable to an increase in throughput at the company s manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of compared with revenues the following table identifies the components of the changes in revenues for compared with revenues increase decrease in from unit volume foreign currency service parts sales mix and other revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  compared with  million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily due to increases in unit volume and the favorable impact of foreign currencies 
unit shipments increased to  units in from  units in the increase in unit shipments was due in part to a low level of sales in the first half of as a result of depressed market conditions 
in addition to improved unit volumes  revenues also benefited from the favorable impact of foreign currencies in europe and asia pacific compared with as a result of the strength of foreign currencies compared with the us dollar during the decline in service parts revenues  despite an increase in parts volume  was a result of a partial shift to direct ship sales 
under direct ship sales  nmhg s dealers sell parts that are shipped directly from nmhg to the end user and nmhg recognizes commissions on the sales rather than the gross sales amount

restructuring plan as announced in december  nmhg wholesale has phased out its lenoir  north carolina lift truck component facility and is restructuring other manufacturing and administrative operations  primarily its irvine  scotland lift truck assembly and component facility 
as such  nmhg wholesale recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million  of which million relates to a non cash asset impairment charge and million relates to severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately manufacturing and administrative employees 
severance payments began in and are expected to continue through these actions are designed to essentially complete the restructuring of nmhg wholesale s global manufacturing facility infrastructure 
previously announced programs  such as demand flow technology  selected component outsourcing and innovative lift truck designs have enabled nmhg to maintain substantially unchanged lift truck production capacity in fewer facilities and at a reduced cost 
the lenoir plant s lift truck component operations  including mast and cylinder manufacturing  were consolidated into plants in sulligent  alabama  berea  kentucky  and greenville  north carolina 
the irvine assembly and component facility is being restructured to an appropriately sized operation 
the restructured facility will manufacture three and four wheel electric rider lift trucks and mast components for the european market

also contributing to the higher revenues was a decrease in eliminations due to lower intercompany sales between nmhg wholesale and nmhg retail  primarily in asia pacific 
in europe  improved used unit sales and service revenues were partially offset by lower parts sales 
the decrease in asia pacific was primarily due to a decrease in new unit sales and a shift in mix to lower priced lift trucks

increase decrease in from europe asia pacific foreign currency eliminations nmhg retail s operating loss decreased million primarily due to reduced operating losses in europe and asia pacific 
the improved operating results in europe are primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses  due in part to the positive impact of prior restructuring programs 
also contributing to the improved operating results in europe was the positive impact of increased service revenues discussed above 
improved operating results in asia pacific  despite lower revenues  were due to improved service and rental margins

also contributing to nmhg retail s increased operating loss was an increased operating loss in asia pacific due to a decrease in rental and service contract profits as a result of lower revenues and margins 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses in asia pacific 
nmhg retail s operating loss was also unfavorably impacted by the translation of foreign currencies in europe and asia pacific 
net loss despite the increase in operating loss from to  nmhg retail s net loss decreased million to million in from million in the improvement was primarily a result of the favorable effect of certain tax adjustments as previously discussed

cash used in investing activities increased million  primarily due to an increase in spending on property  plant and equipment as well as a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets 
the increase in capital spending was primarily due to increased spending on tooling and plant improvements related to the production of the new series of to ton internal combustion engine lift trucks 
the decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets was primarily due to the sale of nmhg retail s only wholly owned us dealer in january additionally  during  nmhg wholesale s european operations received government grants to offset the cost of certain improvements to its plant in craigavon  northern ireland 
change financing activities net reduction of long term debt and revolving credit agreements financing fees paid cash dividends paid to nacco net cash used for financing activities cash used for financing activities declined million as nmhg s net reduction to debt decreased by million 
the increase in financing fees paid was the result of costs related to the amendment of nmhg s revolving credit facility 
see further discussion under the heading financing activities below 
financing activities during  nmhg amended its secured  floating rate revolving credit facility to  among other things  reduce the size of the facility to million from million  reduce the applicable interest rate margins  reduce the minimum excess availability requirement from million to million and extend the term of the agreement until may  the maximum availability under the revolving credit facility  as amended  is governed by a borrowing base derived from advance rates against the inventory and accounts receivable of the borrowers  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
adjustments to reserves booked against these assets  including inventory reserves  will change the eligible borrowing base and thereby impact the liquidity provided by the facility 
at december   the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was million  which reflects reductions for the commitments or availability under certain foreign credit facilities and for an excess availability requirement of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  during  nmhg issued million of unsecured senior notes that mature on may  the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of nmhg holding co 
and are guaranteed by substantially all of nmhg s domestic subsidiaries 
nmhg holding co 
has the option to redeem all or a portion of the senior notes on or after may  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes 
the proceeds from the senior notes were reduced by an original issue discount of million 
in addition to the amount outstanding under the senior notes  nmhg had borrowings of approximately million at december  under various working capital facilities 
both the revolving credit facility and terms of the senior notes include restrictive covenants  which  among other things  limit the payment of dividends to nacco 
the amended revolving credit facility also requires nmhg to meet certain financial tests  including  but not limited to  minimum excess availability  maximum capital expenditures  maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio tests 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
nmhg believes that funds available under the revolving credit facility  other available lines of credit and operating cash flows will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs and commitments arising during the next twelve months and until the expiration of nmhg s revolving credit facility in may

the initial proceeds from the senior notes received in were reduced by an original issue discount of million 
the unamortized balance of this discount at december  is million 
therefore  the amount recognized as senior notes in the consolidated balance sheet at december  is million 
an event of default  as defined in the indenture governing nmhg s senior notes  in nmhg s revolving credit facilities  in nmhg s term loan agreements and in nmhg s operating and capital lease agreements  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedule 
no such event of default has occurred under these agreements 
pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation and the company s significant assumptions 
as a result  pension and postretirement funding has not been included in the table above 
pension benefit payments are made from assets of the pension plans 
nmhg expects to contribute approximately million and million to its us and us pension plans  respectively  in nhmg expects to make payments related to its other postretirement plans totaling approximately million over the next ten years 
benefit payments beyond that time cannot currently be estimated 
in addition  nmhg has the following commitments  stated at the maximum undiscounted potential liability  at december  total standby recourse obligations guarantees or repurchase obligations total commercial commitments standby recourse obligations  guarantees or repurchase obligations primarily represent contingent liabilities assumed by nmhg to support financing agreements made between nmhg s customers and third party finance companies for the customer s purchase of lift trucks from nmhg 
for these transactions  nmhg generally retains a perfected security interest in the lift truck  such that nmhg would take possession of the lift truck in the event that nmhg would become liable under the terms of the standby recourse obligations  guarantees or repurchase obligations 
generally  these commitments are due upon demand in the event of default by the customer 
the security interest is normally expected to equal or exceed the amount of the commitment 
to the extent that nmhg would be required to provide funding as a result of these commitments  nmhg believes that the value of its perfected security interest and amounts available under existing credit facilities are adequate to meet these commitments in the foreseeable future 
the amount of the standby recourse or repurchase obligations increase and decrease over time as obligations under existing arrangements expire and new obligations arise in the ordinary course of business 
losses anticipated under the terms of the standby recourse obligations  guarantees or repurchase obligations are not significant and reserves have been provided for such losses in the consolidated financial statements

outlook nmhg wholesale nmhg wholesale expects stronger lift truck markets in in the americas and asia pacific and relatively flat lift truck markets in europe compared with prior periods 
while fourth quarter backlog rose significantly compared with a year ago and orders are anticipated to remain strong  nmhg wholesale anticipates that its unit shipment levels for will increase at controlled rates to accommodate the phase in of newly designed products 
nevertheless  nmhg wholesale expects to continue to have increased volumes in in comparison to levels 
despite the stronger lift truck markets  nmhg wholesale expects to be challenging as the company works to moderate the effect of increases in material costs  which are largely related to supplier price increases for steel 
price increases implemented by nmhg wholesale during are expected to help partially offset the effect of the increased material costs  although the company does not anticipate full cost recovery in further  the company continues to monitor increases in material costs on a regular basis and evaluate the need and potential for future price increases

in addition  if the strength of the british pound sterling  euro and japanese yen compared with the us dollar continue in  costs are expected to increase 
some of these programs are expected to continue to affect operating results unfavorably into  while the benefits from other programs and expense reduction efforts already implemented are expected to help mitigate the costs 
the europe restructuring program is not expected to be complete until the end of however  nmhg wholesale s various long term programs  particularly significant new product development programs  are expected to enhance profitability and generate growth as they begin to mature  particularly in the period

limerock dragline mining operations improved mainly due to the commencement of dragline mining at additional limerock quarries as previously discussed 
at the consolidated non project mining subsidiaries  operating profit improvement at san miguel was offset by increased costs at mlmc because of unfavorable mining conditions during the fourth quarter and the fact that certain costs are no longer capitalized now that the mine has completed its development stage

environmental matters the company s manufacturing operations  like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses  involve the use  disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws 
the company s nacoal and bellaire subsidiaries are affected by the regulations of agencies under which they operate  particularly the federal office of surface mining  the united states environmental protection agency and associated state regulatory authorities 
in addition  nacoal and bellaire closely monitor proposed legislation concerning the clean air act amendments of  reauthorization of the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean water act  the endangered species act and other regulatory actions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk on may   nmhg refinanced a majority of its floating rate debt financing with the issuance of senior notes at a fixed rate of interest 
as a result of this refinancing during  nmhg terminated all of its interest rate swap agreements 
the combined notional amount and fair value of the interest rate swap agreements terminated was million and a payable of million  respectively  on the respective dates of termination 
a small portion of nmhg s financing  however  requires interest payments based on floating interest rates 
also in  hb ps terminated certain interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million and a net payable balance of million on the date of termination 
in addition to the fixed rate debt financing at nmhg  the company s subsidiaries  nmhg  hb ps  kci and nacoal  have entered into certain financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
to reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements for a significant portion of its floating rate financing arrangements 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes 
terms of the interest rate swap agreements require the subsidiaries to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate 
see also note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is an increase to its liabilities 
the fair value  based on a market quote  of nmhg s fixed rate debt  which was issued in  was million at december  assuming a hypothetical decrease in the effective interest yield on this fixed rate debt  the fair value of this liability would increase by million compared with the fair value of this liability at december  nacoal s million fixed rate private placement notes which were issued in have a fair value based on company estimates of million at december  assuming a hypothetical decrease in the effective interest yield on this fixed rate debt  the fair value of this liability would increase by million compared with the fair value of this liability at december  nacoal also has three collateralized notes payable related to the purchase of mining equipment with a book value of million 
book value at december  approximates market value based on company estimates 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in the effective interest yield on this fixed rate debt  the fair value of this liability would increase by million compared with the book and fair value of this liability at december  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would cause an increase in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements liability amount by million compared with its fair value  which is a liability  at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk nmhg and hb ps operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
nmhg and hb ps use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to partially reduce risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies and not for trading purposes 
these contracts mature within one year and require the companies to buy or sell japanese yen  australian dollars  canadian dollars  mexican pesos  british pound sterling or euros for the functional currency in which the applicable subsidiary operates at rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of million at december  see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is either a decrease to its assets or an increase to its liabilities 
assuming a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar compared with other foreign currencies at december   the fair value of foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  which primarily represents forward foreign currency exchange contracts  would decline by million compared with its fair value at december  it is important to note that the loss in fair value indicated in this sensitivity analysis would be somewhat offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying receivables  payables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
commodity price risk the company uses certain commodities  including steel  resins  linerboard and diesel fuel  in the normal course of its manufacturing and mining processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to variability as the market for these commodities change 
the company monitors this risk and  from time to time  enters into derivative contracts 
table of contents to hedge this risk 
the company does not currently have any such derivative contracts outstanding  nor does the company have any significant purchase obligations to obtain fixed quantities of commodities in the future
