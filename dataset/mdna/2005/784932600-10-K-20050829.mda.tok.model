table of contents introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide readers with an understanding of the company 
the following are included in our md a overview of our business and industry  critical accounting policies  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  and risk factors 
overview of our business and industry business  principal products  and locations we are a leading provider of human capital management solutions  which are designed to increase organizational performance through the implementation of a management system for aligning goals  developing and motivating people and measuring results 
our solutions can help large enterprises to align the workforce around the organization s business objectives  efficiently manage regulatory compliance  increase sales and channel readiness  accelerate time to competency of people across the extended enterprise  increase speed of customer acquisition  shorten time to market of new products and increase visibility into organizational performance 
we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april in august  we shipped our generally available version of saba performance 
on may   we completed the acquisition of thinq learning solutions  inc thinq  a provider of enterprise learning management solutions 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the aggregate consideration payable by us was up to  shares of common stock and  at closing  the cash portion of the consideration was reduced to  the  shares are subject to a post closing balance sheet adjustment 
in addition  up to an additional  shares of our common stock may be issued over a three year period pursuant to an earn out provision 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition were recorded at their fair values as of may  the total preliminary purchase price  including acquisition related transaction costs  was million 
we believe our acquisition of thinq supports our long term strategic direction  strengthens our competitive position in the human capital management market  expands our customer base and provides greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation and increase stockholder value 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the sale of perpetual licenses of our software products and related product support and professional services 
specifically  we license our software solutions in multi element arrangements that include a combination of our software  product support and or professional services 
to date  a substantial majority of our software license revenue has been derived from saba learning 
our license revenue is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  typically six to months 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue 

table of contents product support includes technical support and future updates for the applicable software product 
we typically sell support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license 
after the initial period  support is renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer 
accordingly  our support revenue depends upon both our sale of additional software licenses and annual renewals of existing support agreements 
in addition  we expect support revenue to increase to reflect support provided to an expanded customer base resulting from the thinq acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded adjustments totaling million to reduce thinq s support obligations to its estimated fair value as of may  as former thinq customers renew these support contracts  we will recognize the full value of the support contracts as deferred revenues and recognize the related revenue ratably over the contract period 
the growth rate of support revenue does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of license revenue as the support renewal rate has a greater impact on support revenue as our installed base of customers grows 
for example  if license revenues remained constant  support revenue would continue to grow as a result of the incremental support revenue associated with new license sales  assuming renewal rates stayed relatively constant 
we believe that support revenue will continue to grow as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers  as well as former thinq customers  will renew their annual contracts and the sale of new software licenses will increase the number of customers that purchase support 
our professional services offerings include i implementation services  ii education services for our customers regarding how to use our software  and iii hosting services that enable customers that separately purchase software licenses to access and use the software on computers operated by or for us 
our implementation and education services are typically initiated and provided to customers that license software directly from us over a period of three to nine months after licensing the software 
accordingly  our implementation and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of license revenue generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period 
in addition  our implementation and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software updates as our customers generally engage our services to assist with the implementation and education of their software upgrade 
although we primarily provide implementation services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
hosting services are generally provided pursuant to annual agreements and the associated revenue is recognized ratably over the hosting term 
our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
in addition  we have ten non us subsidiaries in india  france  japan  germany  the united kingdom  canada and australia through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
significant trends and developments in our business since we commenced operations in and continuing throughout fiscal  our business grew rapidly 
during fiscal and continuing through the first three quarters of fiscal  our revenues declined as a result of a deterioration in the overall economy and information technology industry 
beginning in the later part of fiscal  many key indicators began to demonstrate signs of an economic recovery 
consistent with these indicators  our business began to improve during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  in response to the global economic slowdown  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
the restructuring programs included worldwide workforce reductions across all functions and consolidation of excess facilities 
although we do not have any current plans to implement additional restructuring programs  business conditions may require us to reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce or consolidate excess facilities in the future 
there were no restructuring programs implemented in fiscal 
table of contents despite these recent improvements in macro economic trends  we believe many of our customers have not resumed previous levels of expenditures on information technologies  particularly enterprise software 
we attribute this continued level of depressed spending on enterprise software to customers concerns regarding the sustainability of the current economic recovery and the current geopolitical environment 
in order to achieve profitability  we will need to generate significantly higher revenue and continue to manage our expenses 
our ability to generate higher revenues and achieve profitability depends on many factors  including the demand for our products and services  the level of product and price competition  market acceptance of our new products  general economic conditions and the successful integration of thinq 
in this regard  we continue to invest in areas that we believe can accelerate revenue growth and to manage expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
we experience seasonality during our first fiscal quarter as sales are typically lower than sales in the immediately preceding fourth fiscal quarter 
our first fiscal quarter occurs during the summer months when general business activities slow down in a number of territories where we conduct our operations  particularly europe 
our commission structure and other sales incentives also tend to result in fewer sales in the first fiscal quarter than in the fourth fiscal quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first quarter will continue 
changes to previously announced fiscal fourth quarter and annual results on june   we announced our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results 
subsequent to that date  we obtained an assessment from a foreign tax authority 
as a result  we adjusted our previously announced fiscal results by increasing both our fiscal fourth quarter and annual net losses by  and net loss per common share by 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 

table of contents sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to support and professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
license revenues from sales of our perpetual licenses are recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and we generally recognize revenue from resellers when an end user has been identified and the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
revenues from software licenses with terms of less than three years and from our hosting services are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the support term  typically months  and revenue related to implementation  consulting  education  and other services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we primarily provide implementation and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
we recognize revenue from fixed fee contracts as the services are delivered  using labor hours incurred as a percentage of expected total labor hours as a measure of completion 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method 
we use labor hours incurred as a percentage of total expected hours as the measure of progress towards completion 
saba recognizes revenue from multiple element arrangements involving licenses and hosting services in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as these arrangements are with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of our software independent of the hosting services 
revenue from saba s application service provider offerings is recognized under sab  revenue recognition  as these arrangements are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access saba s software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of saba s software 
revenue from both saba s hosting services and application service provider offerings are recognized as service arrangements  whereby the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  as of may   is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
effective june   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as such  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of may  in addition  we evaluated our purchased intangible assets and determined that all such assets have determinable lives 
our goodwill balance at may  was million  including million recorded as a result of our acquisition of thinq 
amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was  for fiscal and  for as of may   our purchased intangible assets balance  taking into account the thinq acquisition  was million 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
any reduction of enterprise fair value below the recorded amount of stockholders equity could require us to write down the value of and record an expense for an impairment loss 

table of contents restructuring costs 
the total accrued restructuring balance as of may  was  which was comprised of  for facilities related charges and  for workforce reduction charges 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas where we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to factors such as changes in property occupancy rates and rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined 
results of operations years ended may   and revenues year ended may  percent of total revenue may  percent of total revenue may  percent of total revenue dollars in thousands revenues license services total revenues total revenues increased during fiscal compared to fiscal and declined during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in total revenues in fiscal over fiscal was due to increases in both license and services revenues 
the decline in total revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from customers outside the united states represented approximately for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal in fiscal and  no customer represented more than of our total revenues 
in fiscal  one customer accounted for of our revenues 
license revenue 
license revenue increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in license revenue in the united states resulting from the expansion of our north american sales team in fiscal license revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenue in the united states partially offset by an increase in european license revenue 
services revenue 
services revenue increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in support revenue of million resulting from a high renewal rate combined with the increase of new license sales and consulting revenue of million primarily due to an increase in the number of active projects in fiscal as a result of an increase in the number of new license sales during the year 
services revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in consulting revenue of million offset by increases in support revenue of million 
the decline in consulting revenue during fiscal was due to a decrease in the number of active projects as a result of a decrease in the number of new license sales during the year 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues and the mix of license and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues has varied significantly primarily due to variability in new license sales 

table of contents cost of revenues year ended may  percent of total revenue may  percent of total revenue may  percent of total revenue dollars in thousands cost of revenues cost of license cost of services amortization of acquired developed technology total cost of revenues cost of license revenue 
our cost of license revenue includes the cost of manuals and product documentation  production media  shipping costs and royalties to third parties 
the changes in the cost of license revenue during fiscal years  and were primarily attributable to variability in the amount of royalties paid to third parties 
cost of services revenue 
our cost of services revenue includes salaries and related expenses for our professional services and support organizations  as well as third party subcontractors  hosting costs and billed expenses 
the increase in cost of services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting personnel expenses driven by an increase in service revenues in fiscal in fiscal compared to fiscal  the decrease in cost of services revenue was primarily attributable to a reduction in consulting personnel in response to a decline in consulting services revenue 
cost of services revenue represented of services revenue for fiscal  of services revenue for fiscal and services revenue for fiscal the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher consultant utilization rates  as well as an increased percentage of higher margin support revenue as a percentage of total services revenue 
the increase in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower consultant utilization rates and lower realized average hourly billing rates for consultants  partially offset by an increased percentage of higher margin support revenues as a percentage of total services revenue 
because our cost of services revenue is greater than our cost of license revenue  cost of total revenues as a percentage of total revenues will fluctuate based on the mix of licenses and services sold 

table of contents operating expenses we classify all operating expenses  except amortization of stock compensation charges  amortization of purchased intangible assets and settlement of litigation  to the research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate these expenses to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such expenses based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts and administrative and professional services fees

research and development expense decreased  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in employee related costs as a result of reallocating headcount from the united states to our lower cost development center in india 
research and development expense decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower employee related costs in the united states attributable to the restructuring of our united states operations 
this resulted in overall headcount savings of approximately million 
the decrease in research and development expense was partially offset by an increase in employee related expenses of  as we increased staffing in our lower cost development facility in india 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to a decrease in travel and entertainment and other personnel related costs of approximately  and a decrease in facilities related costs of approximately  these costs were partially offset by an increase in marketing related programs and services of approximately  sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a reduction in salary and employee benefits expense of million  due to fewer sales and marketing personnel  a decrease in severance payments of  reduced commissions of million due to lower revenues and a decrease of  as a result of lower marketing expenditures

table of contents an increase of  from fiscal due to a net credit in of  facilities related costs also increased by approximately  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in general and administrative expenses resulted from a decrease of  in employee related salary and benefits expenditure due to lower headcount and a decrease of  attributable to reduced legal expenses due to the settlement of a patent infringement case in september amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock compensation charges 
during fiscal  we amortized our remaining deferred stock compensation of  as compared with none in fiscal and million in fiscal included in the charges for fiscal is  for compensation expense resulting from the acceleration of vesting of common stock for certain terminated employees 
this charge was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred stock compensation of  that resulted from the cancellation of unvested stock options due to employee attrition and reductions in workforce 
also included in fiscal is compensation expense of  related to the acceleration of amortization of deferred stock compensation for options that were cancelled in accordance with our voluntary stock option exchange program 
the exchange program is not expected to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the noncompetition agreements resulted from our march acquisition of human performance technologies  inc we amortized  related to the acquisition of human performance technologies  inc during fiscal in fiscal  we amortized  of purchased intangibles related to customer relationships as a result of our may acquisition of thinq 
in addition  we amortized the remaining  related to the acquisition of human performance technologies  inc settlement of litigation 
in september  we settled pending patent litigation and recorded a charge of million 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we were required to pay million over nine months 
the remaining balance of  at may  was paid in full during june in addition  we issued approximately  shares of our common stock valued at  as of the settlement date 
restructuring charges during fiscal  we reduced our restructuring reserve  as a result of an amendment to a facility sub tenant lease 
during each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  saba implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align its operations and cost structure with market conditions 
the restructuring programs during fiscal were implemented under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  while the restructuring programs during fiscal and fiscal were implemented under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the restructuring programs included worldwide workforce reductions across all functions and consolidation of excess facilities 
workforce reduction charges consist primarily of severance and fringe benefits 
the restructuring charges are classified in the statement of operations as follows years ended may  in thousands cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative 
table of contents during fiscal  saba recorded net restructuring charges of  these charges were comprised of  for an excess facility that arose after default by a subtenant and  from the consolidation of an excess facility 
these charges were partially offset by a  decrease to a workforce reduction accrual made in a prior period that resulted from severance payments that were less than previous estimates 
the excess facilities charges were based on the present value of the sum of non cancelable lease costs  less estimates for future sublease income  which will be paid over the estimated vacancy periods through fiscal during fiscal  saba recognized accretion expense of  due to the passage of time in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of these restructurings  saba estimates that it will not recognize net lease expenses of approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  saba recorded net restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges were comprised of million for employee severance payments and  from the consolidation of an excess facility 
this restructuring included a worldwide workforce reduction of employees across all business functions and geographies 
as of august   all amounts relating this restructuring had been paid 
it is expected that the remaining workforce reduction payments will be made by the end of fiscal amounts related to the excess facility charge will be paid over the remaining lease periods through the end of fiscal interest income and other  net interest income and other  net consists of interest income  and other non operating expenses 
interest income and other  net was a net loss of  in fiscal  a net loss of  in fiscal and net income of  in fiscal the decrease in net loss in fiscal compared to was due primarily to a decrease in foreign exchange losses of  resulting from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables and an increase in interest income in fiscal of  the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to foreign exchange losses of  resulting from unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables compared to foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to was due to a decrease in average debt outstanding in compared to the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to savings realized from our buyout of approximately million of capital leases in fiscal provision for income taxes from inception to may   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes 
we recorded income tax expense of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal income tax expense has consisted entirely of foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 
we are subject to routine income tax audit by certain foreign tax authorities 
during fiscal year  we received notices of assessment relating to transfer pricing matters which we are contesting 
we believe that adequate tax provisions have been provided for the likely outcome of the ongoing examination 
we will continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  including potential assessments of additional taxes  penalties and or interest  and revise our estimates  if necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our income tax provision and net income 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets  as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth condensed consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended may  this information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we have incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year or any other period

if revenues fall below our expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to estimate revenues between quarters 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes  both domestic and foreign  on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are 
table of contents exercised based on actual gains realized by employees  measured by the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
we receive domestic tax deductions for gains realized by domestic employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital when realized 
our taxes and cash flows could vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of non qualified stock options exercised by employees in any quarter and  consequently  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described under the caption risk factors and below dependence of our revenues on a small number of large orders and the average order value  our ability to attract new customers  any changes in revenue recognition rules and interpretations of these rules  our ability to license additional products to current customers  the announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in the pricing of our products and services or those of our competitors  variability in the mix of our products and services revenues in any quarter  technical difficulties or service interruptions of our computer network systems or the internet generally  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion or contraction of our business  and foreign currency fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   our principal source of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million 
at may  our bank facility covenants required us to maintain cash of million 
year ended may  may  may  dollars in thousands cash used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash used in operating activities our most significant source of operating cash flows stems from customer purchases of our license and support services  support renewals and consulting services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel and facilities related expenditures 
cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing increase 
the increase is primarily a result of greater movements in operating assets and liabilities of million offset by a lower net loss of million for the year as we reduced overall expenses before non cash items such as amortization of intangibles  stock compensation and depreciation by approximately million and increased our revenues by approximately million in fiscal net movements on operating assets and liabilities used approximately million of cash in fiscal compared to net movements that provided million in cash during fiscal the primary sources of this decrease in fiscal were increases in receivables of million as a result of increased revenues in fiscal  particularly in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal  and decreases in accrued expenses and accrued compensation and related expenses of million in fiscal 
table of contents cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily a result of a lower net loss for the year as we reduced overall expenses before non cash items such as amortization of intangibles and depreciation by approximately million during fiscal this was offset by a decrease in revenues of approximately million 
net movements on operating assets and liabilities generated million of cash in fiscal compared to  during fiscal the primary source of this increase in both fiscal and was reductions in receivables as a result of increased collection efforts during the fourth quarter of both fiscal and in addition  during fiscal  deferred revenue increased by  compared to a decline of  during fiscal the primary reason for the increase in deferred revenue was an increase in the level of maintenance bookings  notably in the last two quarters of fiscal  as a result of a higher installed base 
during fiscal  the amount generated from collection of receivables was offset by reductions in accrued expenses of  and accrued compensation of  these movements were due to the pay out of amounts related to our fiscal and restructuring liabilities and sales commissions  which were accrued as of the end of fiscal overall  during fiscal  our net working capital increased to million from million at the end of fiscal the increase arises primarily from net increases in accounts receivable and accrued expenses offset by our net loss and repayment of short term debt 
in fiscal  our net working capital decreased to million from million at the end of fiscal this decrease arose primarily from a net usage of cash as a result of our loss from operations and lower proceeds from financing activities 
in august  we were able to generate additional funds from a private placement  which allowed us to repay the balance outstanding of million on our bank line of credit 
cash provided by investing activities cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to the purchases of property and equipment of approximately  offset by maturities of short term investments of  cash provided by investing activities in fiscal years and was primarily attributable to proceeds from redemptions and maturities of short term investments  net of purchases  of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to reduced proceeds from net redemptions and maturities as a result of fewer short term investments in fiscal cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock that included million in a private placement in the first quarter of fiscal this increase was partially offset by net repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities of approximately million and repayments on equipment term loans of approximately  during fiscal contractual obligations as part of the acquisition of human performance technologies  inc in march  saba assumed a liability of  that represented payments due under an intellectual property agreement 
the liability is being repaid in quarterly installments of  through december  the remaining balance due was  and  at may  and  respectively

the existing equipment loans have maturities from august to february and bear interest either at fixed rates ranging from to or at a variable rate equal  to prime plus 
at may   saba had outstanding aggregate borrowings of million under the then current credit facility and million under the existing equipment loans 
the borrowings under the then current credit facility were repaid in june the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at may  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
of the million in operating leases   which is net of sublease income  is included in accrued restructuring charges as of may  sublease income included in the table below amounts to  for fiscal and  for fiscal payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease and other obligations operating lease obligations total as of may   we did not have any significant purchase obligations for goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit facility  combined with cash flows generated from revenues  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and 
table of contents business expansion requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could choose  to raise additional funds at any time 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
risk factors we have a history of losses  expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability 
we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future from the licensing of saba enterprise learning and providing related services 
over the longer term  we expect to derive revenues from new products such as saba enterprise performance and related services 
in the future  we expect to continue to incur non cash expenses relating to the amortization of purchased intangible assets that will contribute to our net losses  along with any potential goodwill impairment 
as of may   we had million of purchased intangible assets to be amortized as a result of our recent acquisition of thinq learning solutions  inc  and our remaining goodwill balance was million 
as a result  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues and manage expenses in order to achieve profitability or control negative cash flows 
if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain it on a consistent basis 
fluctuations in our results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future 
for instance  in the last two fiscal years  our quarterly revenues have fluctuated between approximately million and million and our quarterly net loss has fluctuated between approximately  and million 
our quarterly operating results are likely to be particularly affected by the number of customers licensing our products during any quarter and the size of such licensing transactions 
as a result  we have limited visibility into our future revenue  especially license revenue  which often has been heavily concentrated in the third month of each quarter 
since we forecast our expenses based in part on future revenue projections  our operating results would be adversely affected if we cannot meet those revenue projections 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include the demand for our products and professional services and our efficiency in rendering our professional services  the variability in the mix of our license and services revenue in any quarter  the variability in the mix of the type of services delivered in any quarter and the extent to which third party contractors are used to provide such services  the size and complexity of our license transactions and potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  the amount and timing of our operating expenses and capital expenditures  the performance of our international business  which accounts for a substantial part of our consolidated revenues  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 

table of contents our operating expenses are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
during fiscal and fiscal  we took actions to reduce our operating expenses and  while we may from time to time reduce operating expenses in response to variability in our revenues  including variability caused by downturns in the united states and or international economies  over the long term  we generally expect to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations  fund greater levels of research and development  develop new alliances  increase our services and support capabilities and improve our operational and financial systems 
if our revenues do not increase along with these expenses  our business would be seriously harmed and net losses in a given quarter would be even larger than expected 
we may undertake future restructuring to align such expenses with revenues 
our products have a long sales cycle  which increases the cost of completing sales and renders completion of sales less predictable 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long 
a customer s decision to purchase our products and services requires the commitment to increase performance through human capital development and management  involves a significant allocation of resources  and is influenced by a customer s budgetary cycles 
to successfully sell our products and services  we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and services 
we may commit a substantial amount of time and resources to potential customers without assurance that any sales will be completed or revenues generated 
many of our potential customers are large enterprises that generally take longer to make significant business decisions 
our public sector customers  in particular  are subject to extensive procurement procedures that require many reviews and approvals 
our typical sales cycle has been approximately six to months  making it difficult to predict the quarter in which we may recognize revenue 
the delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 
if our sales cycle were to unexpectedly lengthen in general or for one or more large orders  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenues 
if we were to experience a delay on a large order  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given quarter 
a decline in the price of  or demand for  our main product  saba enterprise learning  or our related services offerings  would seriously harm our revenues and operating margins 
to date  saba enterprise learning and related services have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
we anticipate that revenues from saba enterprise learning and related services will continue to constitute a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  a decline in the price of  or demand for  saba enterprise learning or failure to achieve broad market acceptance would seriously harm our business 
if our new products  including saba enterprise performance  fail to achieve market acceptance  our reliance on saba enterprise learning will deepen 
we experience seasonality in our sales  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we experience quarterly seasonality in the licensing of our products and delivery of our services 
for example  revenue has historically been lower in our first fiscal quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth fiscal quarter 
contributing to this seasonality is the timing of our first fiscal quarter that occurs during the summer months when general business activities slow down in a number of territories where we conduct our operations  particularly europe 
our commission structure and other sales incentives also tend to result in fewer sales in the first fiscal quarter than in the fourth fiscal quarter 
these seasonal variations in our revenue are likely to lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our performance depends on a new market human capital development and management 
the market for software solutions that automate human capital development and management is at an early stage of development and rapidly evolving 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the suite of 
table of contents products and services in this market 
if this market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect our business would be harmed 
if the market grows  the prices of our products may decline rapidly as alternative products are introduced into the market 
in addition  our products may become obsolete if we fail to anticipate or adapt to evolving technology standards  or if we fail to identify the challenges and risks in this new market or successfully address these risks 
changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue 
while we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  the american institute of certified public accountants continues to issue implementation guidelines for these standards and the accounting profession continues to discuss a wide range of potential interpretations 
additional implementation guidelines  and changes in interpretations of such guidelines  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue to future periods or to recognize lower revenue 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has adopted statement no 
r  which requires us to recognize as an expense stock based compensation to employees based on their fair values  and eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
as a result  when we record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method beginning in fiscal year  we will have significant compensation charges 
for example  for the fiscal years  and  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans under statement no 
r  we estimate that  diluted loss per share  using the fair value method  would have been increased by  and per share  respectively 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
we are in the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires an annual management assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing this assessment 
during the course of our testing we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses which we may not be able to remediate prior to our fiscal year end 
in addition  if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly 
the loss of our senior executives and key personnel would likely cause our business to suffer 
our ability to implement a successful long term strategy  strengthen our competitive position  expand our customer base  and develop and support our products depends to a significant degree on the performance of the senior management team and other key employees 
the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executives or other key employees  and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any officers or key employees 
intense competition in our target market could impair our ability to grow and achieve profitability 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive  dynamic  and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of the competition and the pace of change are expected to increase in the 
table of contents future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we encounter competition with respect to different aspects of our solution from a variety of sources including companies that market and license training  learning  performance  content  resource  talent  and staffing management systems  enterprise software vendors that offer human resources information systems and employee relationship management systems with training and performance modules  potential customers internal development efforts  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of on line learning  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of goods and services and could potentially decide to evolve their marketplaces to include content offerings  and internet portals that offer learning content  performance support tools or recruiting services 
we expect competition from a variety of companies 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do  enabling them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
such resources also enable our competitors to withstand prolonged periods of negative cash flows and unfavorable economic  political  and market conditions 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other partners  thereby increasing the availability of their services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  and competitive pressures that we encounter may seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to manage the complexity of conducting business globally  our international revenues may suffer 
international revenues accounted for   and of our revenues for our fiscal years ended may   and  respectively 
although we intend to continue to expand our international presence  in the future we may not be able to successfully market  sell or distribute our products and services in foreign markets 
the reallocation of certain design  development and testing functions from the united states to our lower cost development center in india intensifies our exposure to international uncertainties 
factors that could materially adversely affect our international operations  and our business and future growth include difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including language barriers  difficulties in maintaining control over product development and quality  and timing of product releases  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries  particularly declining sales during july and august in european markets  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries  particularly european countries in which collections take considerably more time than the united states and collections are more difficult to effect  currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly in countries where we sell our products in denominations other than us dollars  such as in the united kingdom  the euro zone  and japan  or have exposures in intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currencies  
table of contents costs attributable to development of internationalized versions of our products and marketing and sales materials  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  tariffs  export controls  and other trade barriers  and exposure to geopolitical instability  natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism 
delays in releasing new products or enhanced versions of our existing products could adversely affect our competitive position 
as part of our strategy  we expect to regularly release new products and new versions of our existing products 
even if our new products or new versions of our existing products contain the features and functionality our customers want  in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new products or product releases  our competitive position may be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products or product releases in a timely and efficient manner 
due to the complexity of our products  internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre commercial releases may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these products 
in addition  the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products 
the reallocation of certain design  development and testing functions to our new lower cost development center heightens risks relating to product design  development  testing  and introduction 
any delay in releasing future products or enhancements of our products could harm our business 
if we release products containing defects  we may need to halt further shipments and our business and reputation would be harmed 
products as complex as ours often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems 
although our products are subject to rigorous testing and quality control processes  serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial shipment of new products or enhancements to existing products 
although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before shipment to them  our products are not error free 
these errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or delays in customer acceptance and would be detrimental to our business and reputation 
as is typical in the software industry  with each release we have discovered errors in our products after introduction 
we will not be able to detect and correct all errors before releasing our products commercially and these undetected errors could be significant 
we cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future products will not be discovered in the future or that known errors considered minor by us will not be considered serious by our customers  resulting in cancellation of orders  loss of customers  difficulties in achieving our sales goals  increased demands on our support services  and a decrease in our revenues 
to correct such errors  we may expend considerable time and resources to develop and release modifications to our software 
as a result of such errors  we may be subject to warranty and product liability claims that are costly or difficult to settle 
our products and services enable customers to manage critical business information 
if product errors are alleged to cause or contribute to security and privacy breaches or misappropriation of confidential information  we may also be subject to significant liability 
although our license agreements contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability  we cannot assure that they will be enforceable or  if enforceable  interpreted favorably by a court 
claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights  particularly in the software and internet related industries 
we have in the past been 
table of contents subject to an intellectual property action 
in our market  one company initiated patent infringement actions against us and at least four other companies in in september  we settled the action against us and recorded a charge of million 
we have paid all amounts due under this settlement 
we could become subject to additional intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings 
any of these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and could divert management s attention from operating the company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  agreements with our customers typically include indemnity provisions requiring us to hold these customers harmless against specified losses arising from third party claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations  whether or not asserted  due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology  and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  which may represent potential sales and revenue losses that are difficult to quantify 
policing unauthorized used of our technology is difficult  time consuming  and costly 
were we to discover instances of unauthorized use  there can be no assurance that we would be able to enforce our proprietary rights or obtain adequate recovery for our losses 
in addition  we have four patents issued in the united states and five patent applications pending in the united states 
we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued for any of the pending patent applications 
even for the issued patents  or any patent issued to us in the future  there can be no assurance that such patent will protect our intellectual property  or will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
our disaster recovery plan does not include redundant systems  and a disaster could severely damage our operations 
our disaster recovery plan does not include fully redundant systems for our services at an alternate site 
a disaster could severely harm our business because our services could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect the computer systems needed for the day to day operation of saba learning asp edition and our hosting services 
a number of these computer systems are located on or near known earthquake fault zones 
although these systems are designed to be fault tolerant  the systems are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  and other events 
additionally  we do not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate us for all potential losses that could occur 
we outsource the management and maintenance of our hosted and asp solutions to third parties and will depend upon them to provide adequate management and maintenance services 
we rely on third parties to provide key components of our networks and systems 
for instance  we rely on third party internet service providers to host our products for customers who desire to have these solutions hosted 
we also rely on third party communications service providers for the high speed connections that link our and our internet service providers web servers and office systems to the internet 
our reliance on third party 
table of contents providers limits our ability to control critical customer service functions and communications systems 
any internet or communications systems failure or interruption could result in disruption of our service or loss or compromise of customer orders and data 
these failures  especially if they are prolonged or repeated  would make our services less attractive to customers and tarnish our reputation 
we depend upon continuing relationships with third party integrators who support our solutions 
our success depends upon the acceptance and successful integration by customers of our products 
we often rely on third party systems integrators to assist with implementation of our products 
we must continue to rely on these systems integrators even as we increase the size of our professional services group 
if large systems integrators fail to continue to support our solution or commit resources to us  if any of our customers are not able to successfully integrate our solution or if we are unable to adequately train our existing systems integration partners  our business  operating results  and financial condition could suffer 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our third party providers perform to our standards  we have only limited control over the level and quality of service provided by our current and future third party integrators 
we may not be able to secure necessary funding in the future  additional funding may result in dilution to our stockholders 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
we have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect to use our available cash resources and credit facilities primarily to fund sales and marketing activities  research and development  and continued operations  and possibly make future acquisitions 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if our capital requirements increase materially from those currently planned or if revenues fail to materialize  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
alternatively  or in addition to equity financing  we may incur additional debt to raise funds 
additional equity or debt financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
our past and future acquisitions may result in disruptions to our business if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses 
in  we acquired human performance technologies  inc and ultris inc 
and in may we acquired thinq learning solutions  inc we cannot assure that the thinq acquisition will advance our long term strategy 
we may incur greater than anticipated costs from assuming obligations to support thinq products  diverting resources from new products 
thinq customers may decline to upgrade to saba enterprise learning  instead adopting competitors software 
in addition  thinq s suppliers  distributors and key technical  sales and senior management personnel may terminate their relationship with us 
as part of our overall business strategy  we expect to continue to acquire complementary businesses or technologies that will provide additional products or services offerings  additional industry expertise or an expanded geographic presence 
these acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  the incurrence of debt  or potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities which may reduce earnings per share 
in addition  any acquisition may increase the risk of future write offs for acquired in process research and development  write offs for the impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  or amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and our operating results 
for example  as of may  our remaining goodwill balance was million 
acquisitions that we complete expose us to numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  
table of contents the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees  significant customers and strategic partners of the acquired company  and exposure to claims by terminated employees  stockholders of the acquired company or other third parties related to the acquisition 
although we generally obtain indemnification and other contractual protection against such claims  we cannot assure that they will be enforceable or sufficient to protect us 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially 
in the last two fiscal years  the market price for our common stock has fluctuated between per share and per share 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including those described above and the following the announcement of new products and services or product and service enhancements by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts that may follow our stock  developments in our industry  including announcements of significant acquisitions or strategic partnerships  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and nasdaq national market technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
broad market and industry trends may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
volatility in the market price and trading volume of our common stock may prevent our stockholders from selling their shares profitably 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could delay or prevent a change in control 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquiror were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquiror would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms that make it difficult to remove all directors at once 
the acquiror would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual meeting 
the acquiror will not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which will require the acquiror to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
our board of directors also has the ability to issue preferred stock that would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

table of contents our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquiror that it did not feel was in our strategic interests 
if the acquiror was discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by our anti takeover measures  our stockholders could lose the opportunity to sell their shares at a favorable price 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
in may  we borrowed million under a term loan agreement and repaid the approximately million outstanding debt of thinq 
borrowings under the new term loan must be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest 
the interest rate on the term loan is at the bank s prime rate plus 
at may   we also had outstanding equipment term loans of  that bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in connection with the term loan  we must comply with certain covenants under the credit facility that requires us to maintain a minimum balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of a million as of any fiscal quarter end during the period from may  through may   b million for any date that is not a fiscal quarter end during such period  c million at any time during the period june  through may   and d million for any date thereafter 
the credit facility also restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 
if we fail to satisfy covenants under the credit facility and has not obtained an applicable waiver or amendment of the covenants from the bank  we may have to face default on our credit facility 
as of may   we were in compliance with the then applicable covenants 
at may   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
of this amount  approximately million was invested in money market accounts bearing variable interest rates of between 
and 
the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents is un invested cash 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and japanese yen 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from intercompany accounts with our foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  and  when remeasured and translated to us dollars  will have an impact on our operating results depending upon the movement in foreign currency rates 
during fiscal  our total realized and unrealized losses due to movements in foreign currencies was  as exchange rates vary  these foreign exchange results  may vary and adversely or favorably impact operating results 
an unfavorable change of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements
