item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview joint venture with cytogen corporation 
the joint venture currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to the joint venture 
if we do not reach an agreement regarding the budget and work plan  the programs conducted by the joint venture would likely be delayed or halted and the joint venture could be dissolved 
we and cytogen provide research and development services to the joint venture and are compensated for our services based on agreed upon terms which approximate our cost 
all inventions made by us in connection with 
back to contents our research and development services to the joint venture are required to be assigned to the joint venture for its use and benefit 
the principal joint venture agreements generally terminate upon the last to expire of the patents licensed by the members to the joint venture or upon a breach by either member that is not cured within days of written notice 
of the patents and patent applications that are the subject of the joint venture  the issued patents expire on dates ranging from and patent term extensions and pending patent applications may extend the period of patent protection and thus the term of the joint venture agreements  when and if such patent applications are allowed and issued 
licenses we are a party to license agreements under which we have obtained rights to use certain technologies in our product development programs 
our joint venture with cytogen has also entered into license agreements with third parties 
set forth below is a summary of the more significant of these licenses 
ur labs we have entered into an agreement with ur labs to obtain worldwide exclusive rights to intellectual property rights related to mntx

as of december   we have paid to aquila  under this agreement 
we have no future cash payment obligations relating to milestones under the agreement  although we are required to pay aquila royalties on the sale of products we develop under the license 
abgenix in february  our joint venture with cytogen entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with abgenix to use abgenix xenomouse technology for generating fully human antibodies to the joint venture s psma antigen 
in consideration for the license  the joint venture paid a nonrefundable  non creditable license fee and is obligated to pay additional payments upon the occurrence of defined milestones associated with the development and commercialization program for products incorporating an antibody generated utilizing the xenomouse technology 
as of december   the joint venture has paid to abgenix  under this agreement 
if the joint venture achieves certain milestones specified under the agreement  it will be obligated to pay abgenix an additional approximately million 
furthermore  the joint venture is required to pay royalties based upon net sales of any antibody products 
this agreement may be terminated  after an opportunity to cure  by abgenix for cause upon days prior written notice 
the joint venture has the right to terminate this agreement upon days prior written notice 
if not terminated early  this agreement continues until the later of the expiration of the xenomouse technology patents that may result from pending patent applications or seven years from the first commercial sale of the products 
alphavax human vaccines in september  the joint venture entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with alphavax human vaccines to use the alphavax replicon vector system to create a therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine incorporating the joint venture s proprietary psma antigen 
in consideration for the license  the joint venture paid a nonrefundable  noncreditable license fee and is obligated to pay additional payments upon the occurrence of certain defined milestones associated with the development and commercialization program for products incorporating alphavax system 
as of december   the joint venture has paid to alphavax  under this agreement 
if the joint venture achieves certain milestones specified under the agreement  it will be obligated to pay alphavax an additional approximately million 
furthermore  the joint venture is required to pay annual maintenance fees until the first commercial sale and royalties based upon net sales of any products developed using alphavax system 
this agreement may be terminated  after an opportunity to cure  by alphavax under specified circumstances that include the joint venture s failure to achieve milestones  however  the consent of alphavax to 
back to contents revisions to the due dates for the milestones shall not be unreasonably withheld 
the joint venture has the right to terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
if not terminated early  this agreement continues until the later of the expiration of the patents relating to alphavax system or seven years from the first commercial sale of the products developed using alphavax system 
the last of the presently issued patents expires in  however  patent applications filed in the us and internationally that we have also licensed and patent term extensions may extend the period of our license rights  when and if such patent applications are allowed and issued or patent term extensions are granted 
adarc we have a letter agreement with the aaron diamond aids research center pursuant to which we have the exclusive right to pursue the commercial development  directly or with a partner  of products related to hiv based on patents jointly owned by adarc and us 
rights and obligations we have the right generally to defend and enforce patents licensed by us  either in the first instance or if the licensor chooses not to do so 
in addition  our license agreement with ur labs regarding mntx gives us the right to prosecute and maintain the licensed patents 
we bear the cost of engaging in all of these activities with respect to our license agreements with sloan kettering for gmk  columbia for our hiv product candidates subject to the columbia license and ur labs for mntx 
with most of our other license agreements  the licensor bears the cost of engaging in all of these activities  although we may share in those costs under certain circumstances 
historically  our costs of defending patent rights  both our own and those we license  have not been material 
the licenses to which we are a party impose various milestone  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty and other payment  insurance  indemnification and other obligations on us and are subject to certain reservations of rights 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the termination of the applicable agreement  which would likely cause us to terminate the related development program and cause a complete loss of our investment in that program 
patents and proprietary technology our policy is to protect our proprietary technology  and we consider the protection of our rights to be important to our business 
in addition to seeking us patent protection for many of our inventions  we generally file patent applications in canada  japan  european countries that are party to the european patent convention and additional foreign countries on a selective basis in order to protect the inventions that we consider to be important to the development of our foreign business 
generally  patents issued in the us are effective for the longer of years from the date of issue or years from the earliest asserted filing date of the corresponding patent application  if the patent application was filed prior to june   and years from the earliest asserted filing date of the corresponding patent application  if the application was filed on or after june  in addition  in certain instances  the patent term can be extended up to a maximum of five years to recapture a portion of the term during which the fda regulatory review was being conducted 
the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law  although most countries provide for patent terms of years from the earliest asserted filing date and allow patent extensions similar to those permitted in the us we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our product areas 
we generally require our employees  consultants and corporate partners who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements 
currently our patent portfolio relating to our proprietary technologies in the symptom management and supportive care  hiv and cancer areas is comprised  on a worldwide basis  of patents that have been issued or allowed and pending patent applications  which we either own directly or of which we are the exclusive licensee 
our issued patents expire on dates ranging from through in addition  our joint venture with 
back to contents cytogen owns directly or is the exclusive licensee of five patents that have been issued or allowed and pending patent applications 
the joint venture s issued patents expire on dates ranging from to patent term extensions and pending patent applications may extend the period of patent protection afforded our products in development 
we are aware of intellectual property rights held by third parties that relate to products or technologies we are developing 
for example  we are aware of other groups investigating methylnaltrexone and other peripheral opioid antagonists  psma or related compounds and ccr monoclonal antibodies and of patents held  and patent applications filed  by these groups in those areas 
while the validity of issued patents  patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain  if asserted against us  any related patent rights could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products 
the research  development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical often involves alternative development and optimization routes  which are presented at various stages in the development process 
the preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend upon subsequent discoveries and test results 
there are numerous third party patents in our field  and it is possible that to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products we will need to obtain a license to a patent  which would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product 
if we cannot negotiate a license  we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether 
government regulation progenics and our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by the food and drug administration in the us and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  the preclinical and clinical testing  safety  effectiveness  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing  export  storage  recordkeeping  advertising and promotion of our products 
none of our product candidates has received marketing or other approval from the fda or any other similar regulatory authority 
fda approval of our products  including a review of the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce such products  will be required before such products may be marketed in the us the process of obtaining approvals from the fda can be costly  time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays 
we cannot assure you that approvals of our proposed products  processes  or facilities will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if we experience delays in obtaining  or do not obtain  approvals for our products  commercialization of our products would be slowed or stopped 
moreover  even if we obtain regulatory approval  the approval may include significant limitations on indicated uses for which the product could be marketed or other significant marketing restrictions 
the process required by the fda before our products may be approved for marketing in the us generally involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication  submission to the fda of a marketing application  and fda review of the marketing application in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to gain preliminary information about a product s pharmacology and toxicology and to identify any safety problems that would preclude testing in humans 
products must generally be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices  and preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with fda regulations regarding good laboratory practices 
the results of the preclinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind investigational new drug application 
an ind is a submission which the sponsor of a 
back to contents clinical trial of an investigational new drug must make to the fda and which must become effective before clinical trials may commence 
the ind submission must include  among other things a description of the sponsor s investigational plan  protocols for each planned study  chemistry  manufacturing  and control information  pharmacology and toxicology information  and a summary of previous human experience with the investigational drug 
unless the fda objects to  makes comments to or raises questions concerning an ind  the ind will become effective days following its receipt by the fda  and initial clinical studies may begin  although companies often obtain affirmative fda approval before beginning such studies 
we cannot assure you that submission of an ind by us will result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials 
a new drug application  or nda  is an application to the fda to market a new drug 
the nda must contain  among other things  information on chemistry  manufacturing  and controls  non clinical pharmacology and toxicology  human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability  and clinical data 
the new drug may not be marketed in the us until the fda has approved the nda 
a biologic license application  or bla  is an application to the fda to market a biological product 
the bla must contain  among other things  data derived from nonclinical laboratory and clinical studies which demonstrate that the product meets prescribed standards of safety  purity and potency  and a full description of manufacturing methods 
the biological product may not be marketed in the us until a biologic license is issued 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s good clinical practice requirements under protocols that detail  among other things  the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety  and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
further  each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board 
the institutional review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects  the possible liability of the institution and the informed consent disclosure which must be made to participants in the clinical trial 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap 
during phase  when the drug is initially administered to human subjects  the product is tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific  targeted indications  determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a new product is found to have an effect and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase evaluation  phase trials are undertaken in order to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population 
the fda may suspend clinical trials at any point in this process if it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 

back to contents the results of the preclinical studies and clinical studies  the chemistry and manufacturing data  and the proposed labeling  among other things  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla  approval of which must be obtained prior to commencement of commercial sales 
the fda may refuse to accept the application for filing if certain administrative and content criteria are not satisfied  and even after accepting the application for review  the fda may require additional testing or information before approval of the application 
our analysis of the results of our clinical studies is subject to review and interpretation by the fda  which may differ from our analysis 
we cannot assure you that our data or our interpretation of data will be accepted by the fda 
in any event  the fda must deny an nda or bla if applicable regulatory requirements are not ultimately satisfied 
in addition  we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in applicable law or fda policy during the period of product development and fda regulatory review 
moreover  if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may be made subject to various conditions  including post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product  or may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
finally  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 
both before and after approval is obtained  a product  its manufacturer  and the sponsor of the marketing application for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight 
violations of regulatory requirements at any stage  including the preclinical and clinical testing process  the approval process  or thereafter  may result in various adverse consequences  including fda delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  withdrawal of an approved product from the market or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or sponsor 
in addition  later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such product  manufacturer  or sponsor  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
also  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a pharmaceutical product by comparable government regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to marketing such product in such countries 
the approval procedure varies from country to country  and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
although there are some procedures for unified filing for certain european countries  in general  each country has its own procedures and requirements 
we do not currently have any facilities or personnel outside of the us in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and various other present and potential future federal  state or local regulations 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for storing  handling  using and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contaminations or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any legal and regulatory violations as well as damages that result 
any such liability could have a material adverse effect on progenics 
manufacturing we currently rely on single source third party manufacturers for the supply of both bulk and finished form mntx 
we believe that our existing arrangements with such single source third party manufacturers are reliable and adequate for the balance of our clinical trial and initial commercial supply requirements 
however  we may in the future seek additional manufacturers for bulk and finished form mntx as supplements and backup to our current arrangements 
in march  we entered into an agreement with mallinckrodt inc for the supply of the bulk form of mntx 
the contract provides for mallinckrodt to supply product based on a rolling forecast to be provided by us to mallinckrodt with respect to our anticipated needs and for the purchase by us of product on specified pricing terms 
under this agreement  we are obligated to purchase a portion of our requirements for bulk form mntx from mallinckrodt  although we have no set minimum purchase obligation 
product supplied to us by mallinckrodt is required to satisfy technical specifications agreed to by us 
the contract term extends to january  and renews automatically thereafter for successive one year terms unless either party provides prior notice to the other 
prior to its expiration  the contract may be terminated by either party upon a material breach by the other party or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy or insolvency events 

back to contents we currently manufacture pro  pro  gmk and protein vaccines in our biologics pilot production facilities in tarrytown  new york 
we have recently added a liter bioreactor to increase our manufacturing capacity in support of our clinical programs 
we have also acquired a  liter bioreactor  and we are considering the appropriate time and manner for installing and deploying this additional resource 
we believe that our existing production facilities will be sufficient to meet our initial needs for clinical trials for these product candidates 
however  these facilities may be insufficient for all of our late stage clinical trials for these product candidates and would be insufficient for commercial scale requirements 
we may be required to further expand our manufacturing staff and facilities  obtain new facilities or contract with third parties or corporate collaborators to assist with production 
in order to establish a full scale commercial manufacturing facility for any of our product candidates  we would need to spend substantial additional funds  hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with the extensive fda regulations applicable to such a facility 
sales and marketing we plan to market products for which we obtain regulatory approval through co marketing  co promotion  licensing and distribution arrangements with third party collaborators 
we may also consider contracting with a third party professional pharmaceutical detailing and sales organization to perform the marketing function for our products 
cytogen has certain marketing rights with respect to the psma product candidates 
competition competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and characterized by ongoing research and development and technological change 
we face competition from many companies and major universities and research institutions in the us and abroad 
we will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products for diseases targeted by our technologies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  experience in conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  operating experience  research and development and marketing capabilities and production capabilities than we do 
our products under development may not compete successfully with existing products or products under development by other companies  universities and other institutions 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda marketing approval for products more rapidly than we do 
drug manufacturers that are first in the market with a therapeutic for a specific indication generally obtain and maintain a significant competitive advantage over later entrants 
accordingly  we believe that the speed with which we develop products  complete the clinical trials and approval processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important competitive factor 
with respect to mntx  there are currently no fda approved products for reversing the debilitating side effects of opioid pain therapy or for the treatment of post operative bowel dysfunction 
we are  however  aware of a product candidate that targets these therapeutic indications 
this product  entereg alvimopan  is under development by adolor corporation  in collaboration with an affiliate of glaxosmith kline plc 
entereg is in advanced clinical development and is the subject of a pending application for marketing approval in the us we believe  however  that entereg s effects are limited to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract  whereas mntx is available systemically outside of the central nervous system 
additionally  it has been reported that a european specialty pharmaceutical company is in early clinical development of an oral formulation of methylnaltrexone for use in opioid induced constipation 
with respect to our products for the treatment of hiv infection  three classes of products made by our competitors have been approved for marketing by the fda for the treatment of hiv infection and aids reverse transcriptase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and entry inhibitors 
these drugs have shown efficacy in reducing the concentration of hiv in the blood and prolonging asymptomatic periods in hiv positive individuals  especially when administered in combination 
we are aware of several competitors that are developing alternative treatments for hiv infection  including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies  some of which are directed against ccr with respect to gmk  the fda and certain other regulatory authorities have approved high dose alpha interferon for marketing as a treatment for patients with high risk melanoma 
high dose alpha interferon has demonstrated efficacy for this indication 

back to contents with respect to the immunotherapeutic products based on psma that we are developing through our joint venture with cytogen  there are traditional forms of treatment for prostate cancer such as radiation and surgery 
however  if the disease spreads  these forms of treatment can be ineffective 
we are aware of several competitors who are developing alternative treatments for prostate cancer  including in vivo and ex vivo immunotherapies  some of which are directed against psma 
a significant amount of research in the biopharmaceutical field is also being carried out at academic and government institutions 
an element of our research and development strategy is to in license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions 
these institutions are becoming increasingly sensitive to the commercial value of their findings and are becoming more aggressive in pursuing patent protection and negotiating licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed 
these institutions may also market competitive commercial products on their own or in collaboration with competitors and will compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
any resulting increase in the cost or decrease in the availability of technology or product candidates from these institutions may adversely affect our business strategy 
competition with respect to our technologies and product candidates is and will be based  among other things  on efficacy and safety of our products  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product reliability and availability  sales  marketing and manufacturing capabilities  capabilities of our collaborators  reimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others  degree of clinical benefits of our product candidates relative to their costs  method of administering a product  price  and patent protection 
our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and to secure sufficient capital resources for the typically substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
competitive disadvantages in any of these factors could materially harm our business and financial condition 
product liability the testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products involves an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects 
to the extent we elect to test  manufacture or market products independently  we will bear the risk of product liability directly 
we have obtained product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a deductible and a million aggregate limitation 
in addition  where the local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or local policies of insurance are required  we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements 
this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations 
we may not be able to continue to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost  or in adequate amounts 
human resources at december   we had full time employees  of whom  including dr 
maddon  hold phd degrees and three of whom  including dr 
maddon  hold md degrees 
at such date  employees were engaged in research and development  medical and regulatory affairs and manufacturing activities and were engaged in finance  legal  administration and business development 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

back to contents risk factors our business and operations entail a variety of serious risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
our product development programs are inherently risky 
we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on new technologies 
our mntx product candidate  which is designed to reverse certain side effects induced by opioids  is based on a novel method of action that has not yet been proven to be safe or effective 
no drug with mntx s method of action has ever received marketing approval 
additionally  some of our hiv product candidates are designed to be effective by blocking viral entry  and our gmk product candidate is designed to be a therapeutic cancer vaccine 
to our knowledge  no drug designed to treat hiv infection by blocking viral entry with one exception and no cancer therapeutic vaccine has been approved for marketing in the us our other research and development programs  and those conducted through our joint venture with cytogen  involve similarly novel approaches to human therapeutics 
consequently  there is little precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies 
there are a number of technological challenges that we must overcome to complete most of our development efforts 
we may not be able to develop successfully any of our products 
if testing does not yield successful results  our products will not be approved 
to achieve the results we need to obtain marketing approval from regulatory authorities  we or our collaborators must demonstrate a product s safety and efficacy through extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
numerous events may arise during  or as a result of  the testing process  including the following the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  potential products may not have the desired efficacy or may have undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude marketing approval or limit their commercial use if approved  after reviewing test results  we or our collaborators may abandon projects which we previously believed to be promising  and we  our collaborators or regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials if we or they believe that the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
clinical testing is very expensive and can take many years 
results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials 
moreover  many of our products  such as pro and the psma product candidates  are at an early stage of development 
the successful commercialization of early stage products will require significant further research  development  testing  approvals by regulators and additional investment 
our products in the research or preclinical development stage may not yield results that would permit or justify clinical testing 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product under development would delay or prevent marketing approval of the product  which could adversely affect our operating results and credibility 
a setback in our clinical development programs could adversely affect us 
we have several ongoing late stage clinical trials 
we have completed a pivotal phase clinical trial of mntx for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced medical illness  and another pivotal study of mntx for this indication is ongoing 
it is likely that we will need to successfully complete both of these trials in order to obtain approval of the fda to market mntx 
we also have completed a phase clinical trial of intravenous mntx in patients at risk for post operative bowel dysfunction and plan to conduct additional clinical trials of oral mntx in chronic pain patients who experience opioid induced constipation 
if the results of any of these ongoing trials are not satisfactory  or if we encounter problems enrolling patients  clinical trial supply issues or other difficulties  our entire mntx development program could be adversely affected  resulting in delays in commencing or completing clinical trials or in making our regulatory filing for marketing approval 
the need to 
back to contents conduct additional clinical trials or significant revisions to our clinical development plan would lead to delays in our filing for the regulatory approvals necessary to market mntx 
since mntx is our most clinically advanced product  a setback of this nature would have a material adverse effect on our stock price and business 
we also have two ongoing pivotal phase clinical trials for gmk 
in may  our collaborating research cooperative group in one of these trials  ecog  recommended to clinical investigators participating in the trial that they discontinue administering gmk  and as a result that trial did not complete patient dosing as contemplated by the initial trial protocol 
a second pivotal phase trial for gmk was initiated in may  and at present we do not expect to reach the full enrollment of  patients until the second half of if the results of either of the gmk trials are not satisfactory  we may need to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon our gmk program 
we expect to obtain results from our phase clinical trial of our pro hiv therapeutic in the second half of we plan to review these results with the intent of making a decision regarding the ongoing feasibility of this program 
additionally  if the results of our phase study with pro or the preclinical and clinical studies involving the psma vaccine and antibody candidates are not satisfactory  we would need to reconfigure our clinical trial programs to conduct additional trials or abandon the program involved 
we have a history of operating losses  and we may never be profitable 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have derived no significant revenues from product sales or royalties  and we do not expect to achieve significant product sales or royalty revenue for a number of years  if ever 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future  which could increase significantly as we expand our clinical trial programs and other product development efforts 
our ability to achieve and sustain profitability is dependent in part on obtaining regulatory approval to market our products and then commercializing  either alone or with others  our products 
we may not be able to develop and commercialize products 
moreover  our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are commercialized 
we are likely to need additional financing  but our access to capital funding is uncertain 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million 
during the year then ended  we had a net loss of million and used cash in operating activities of million 
we anticipate significant increases in expenditures as we continue to expand our research and development activities  particularly in our mntx programs 
consequently  we will need substantial additional funds to conduct product development activities 
we believe our existing capital resources  together with revenue from currently approved government grants and contracts  should be sufficient to fund the activities contemplated by our current operating plan into the fourth quarter of we intend to seek external funding prior to that time  however  most likely through collaborative agreements  or other license or sale transactions  with one or more pharmaceutical companies regarding mntx or other products  through the issuance and sale of securities or through additional government grants or contracts 
we cannot predict with any certainty when we will need additional funds or how much we will need or if additional funds will be available to us 
our need for future funding will depend on numerous factors  many of which are outside our control 
our access to capital funding is uncertain 
we do not have committed external sources of funding for most of our drug development projects  and we may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
we have developed a contingency plan  which provides for changes in our operations in the event that we are unable to secure additional funding in the near term 
we would likely commence implementing this plan in the second quarter of if we are not able to secure additional funding by such time 
this plan would include focusing our resources on our late stage mntx program  which we believe has the greatest likelihood of generating near term cash flows  and reducing or eliminating funding to some or all of our other product development programs 
there are other cost containment initiatives that we could implement 
these steps would likely adversely impact our prospects for product commercialization and  consequently  our prospects for product sales and profitability 
we might also need to sell or license our product candidates or other technologies on terms that are not favorable to us  which could also 
back to contents adversely affect our prospects for profitability 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us would seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
if we raise funds by issuing and selling securities  it may be on terms that are not favorable to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by selling equity securities  our current stockholders will be diluted  and new investors could have rights superior to our existing stockholders 
if we raise funds by selling debt securities  we could be subject to restrictive covenants and significant repayment obligations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our clinical trials could take longer than we expect 
although for planning purposes we forecast the commencement and completion of clinical trials  and have included many of those forecasts in this report and in other public disclosures  the actual timing of these events can vary dramatically 
for example  during  we experienced delays in our mntx clinical development program as a result of slower than anticipated patient enrollment 
these delays may recur 
our second pivotal phase clinical trial of mntx is being conducted in the hospice setting  where historically there has been limited resources  infrastructure and experienced personnel available to conduct such studies  which can lead to delays 
delays can also be caused by  among other things  deaths or other adverse medical events involving patients or subjects in our clinical trials  regulatory or patent issues  interim or final results of ongoing clinical trials  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions and manufacturing problems 
in addition  our operating plan provides for the delay or suspension of our clinical trials  other than our late stage mntx program  if we are unable to obtain additional funding in the near term 
our clinical programs involving our joint venture with cytogen could also be delayed by disagreements between cytogen and us concerning funding development programs or other matters 
the joint venture currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to the joint venture 
clinical trials involving our product candidates may not commence or be completed as forecasted 
moreover  we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials  and we rely on others to conduct  supervise or monitor some or all aspects of some of our clinical trials 
in addition  certain clinical trials for our products may be conducted by government sponsored agencies  and consequently will be dependent on governmental participation and funding 
we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
as a result of these and other factors  our clinical trials may not commence or be completed as we expect or may not be conducted successfully  in which event investors confidence in our ability to develop products may be impaired and our stock price may decline 
we are subject to extensive regulation  which can be costly and time consuming and can subject us to unanticipated fines and delays 
we and our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda in the us and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  the preclinical and clinical testing  safety  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing  export  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
if we violate regulatory requirements at any stage  whether before or after marketing approval is obtained  we may be subject to forced removal of a product from the market  product seizure  civil and criminal penalties and other adverse consequences 
we do not yet have  and may never obtain  the regulatory approvals we need to market our products 
we will need to obtain regulatory approval before we can market our product candidates 
none of our products has been approved by applicable regulatory authorities for marketing 
the process of obtaining fda and foreign regulatory approvals often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain marketing approvals 
we may not obtain marketing approval from the fda or any other regulatory authority for any of our products under development 

back to contents even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product we might not obtain labeling claims necessary to make the product commercially viable in general  labeling claims define the medical conditions for which a drug product may be marketed  and are therefore very important to the commercial success of a product  we may be required to undertake post marketing trials to verify the product s efficacy or safety  identification of side effects after the product is on the market or the occurrence of manufacturing problems could result in subsequent withdrawal of marketing approval  reformulation of the product  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials  changes in labeling of the product or the need for additional marketing applications  and we will be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continuous regulatory review 
if we fail to receive marketing approval for our products or lose previously received approvals  our financial results would be adversely affected 
even if we obtain marketing approval for our products  they might not be accepted in the marketplace 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
even if our products obtain marketing approval  they may not achieve market acceptance 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will likely lose our entire investment in that product 
marketplace acceptance will depend in part on competition in our industry  which is intense 
the extent to which any of our products achieves market acceptance will depend on competitive factors 
competition in our industry is intense  and it is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
there are products currently in the market that will compete with the products that we are developing  including chemotherapy drugs for treating cancer and aids drugs 
as described below  adolor corporation is developing a drug that would compete with mntx 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
these competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing and render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
if our product candidates receive marketing approval but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our operating results and financial position would suffer 
one or more competitors developing an opioid antagonist may reach the market ahead of us and adversely affect the market potential for mntx 
we are aware that adolor corporation  in collaboration with glaxo group limited  or glaxo  a subsidiary of glaxosmithkline plc  is developing an opioid antagonist  entereg tm alvimopan  for post operative ileus  which has completed phase clinical trials  and for opioid bowel dysfunction and chronic constipation  which are in phase trials 
post operative ileus is a condition similar to post operative bowel dysfunction  a condition for which we are developing mntx 
entereg is further along in the clinical development process than mntx and is the subject of an application pending with the fda for marketing approval in the us additionally  it has been reported that a european specialty pharmaceutical company is in early clinical development of an oral formulation of methylnaltrexone for use in opioid induced constipation 
if either of these products reaches the market before our mntx product  it could achieve a significant competitive advantage relative to our product 
in any event  the considerable marketing and sales capabilities of glaxo may impair our ability to penetrate the market 
disputes with cytogen could delay or halt our psma programs 
our research and development programs relating to vaccine and antibody immunotherapeutics based on psma are conducted through a joint venture between cytogen corporation and us 
this is a joint venture  meaning that our ownership rights in the programs  funding obligations and governance rights generally are equal 
as a result  for the joint venture to operate efficiently  and for the research and development programs to be adequately funded and staffed and productive  we and cytogen must be in agreement on strategic and operational 
back to contents matters 
there is a significant risk that  as a result of differing views and priorities  there will be occasions when we do not agree on various matters  as is the case currently 
our level of commitment to fund the psma joint venture and that of our joint venture partner  cytogen  is based upon a budget and work plan that are developed and approved annually by the parties 
we have in the past experienced delays in reaching agreement with cytogen regarding annual budget issues and strategic and operational matters relating to the joint venture 
the joint venture currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to the joint venture 
if we do not reach an agreement regarding the budget and work plan  we would likely experience delays in advancing the psma programs and may need to dissolve the joint venture and abandon the psma programs being conducted by the joint venture 
we may not reach an agreement with cytogen on these matters 
if we are unable to negotiate collaborative agreements  our cash burn rate could increase and our rate of product development could decrease 
we intend to pursue new collaborative agreements 
for instance  we are currently in discussions with potential strategic collaborators for mntx 
however  we may not be successful in negotiating additional collaborative arrangements 
if we do not enter into new collaborative arrangements  we would have to devote more of our resources to clinical product development and product launch activities  and our cash burn rate would increase or we would need to take steps to reduce our rate of product development 
if we do not remedy our failure to achieve milestones or satisfy conditions regarding some of our product candidates  we may not maintain our rights under our licenses relating to these product candidates 
we are required to make substantial cash payments  achieve specified milestones and satisfy other conditions  including filing for and obtaining marketing approvals and introducing products  to maintain our rights under our licenses  including our licenses from ur labs  inc relating to mntx  sloan kettering institute for cancer research relating to gmk and columbia university relating to pro 
we may not be able to maintain our rights under these licenses 
under our license agreements relating to gmk and pro  we are required  among other things  to have filed for marketing approval for a drug by and to have commenced commercialization of the drug by for gmk and to have filed for marketing approval by for pro 
we have not achieved these and other milestones and are unlikely to achieve them soon 
we are in a similar position with respect to our license agreement with aquila biopharmaceuticals inc concerning qs  a component of gmk 
if we can establish that our failure to achieve these milestones resulted from technical issues beyond our control or delays in clinical studies that could not have been reasonably avoided  we may be entitled to a revision of these milestone dates 
although we believe that we satisfy one or more of these conditions  we may become involved in disputes with our licensors as to our continued right to a license 
if we do not comply with our obligations under our license agreements  the licensors may terminate them 
termination of any of our licenses could result in our losing our rights to  and therefore being unable to commercialize  any related product 
we have had discussions with sloan kettering and columbia to reach agreement on the revision of applicable milestone dates 
we may not  however  reach agreement with these licensors in a manner favorable to us 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  which could adversely impact our ability to commercialize products 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  which may result in increased costs of production or delay product development or commercialization 
in order to commercialize our product candidates successfully  we or our collaborators must be able to manufacture products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner 
the manufacture of our product candidates can be complex  difficult to accomplish even in small quantities  difficult to scale up for large scale production and subject to delays  inefficiencies and low yields of quality products 
the cost of manufacturing some of our products may make them prohibitively expensive 
if adequate supplies of any of our product candidates or related materials are 
back to contents not available to us on a timely basis or at all  our clinical trials could be seriously delayed  since these materials are time consuming to manufacture and cannot be readily obtained from third party sources 
we operate pilot scale manufacturing facilities for the production of vaccines and recombinant proteins 
we believe that  for these types of product candidates  these facilities will be sufficient to meet our initial needs for clinical trials 
however  these facilities may be insufficient for late stage clinical trials for these types of product candidates  and would be insufficient for commercial scale manufacturing requirements 
we may be required to expand further our manufacturing staff and facilities  obtain new facilities or contract with corporate collaborators or other third parties to assist with production 
in the event that we decide to establish a commercial scale manufacturing facility  we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with applicable regulations  which are extensive 
we may not be able to build a manufacturing facility that both meets regulatory requirements and is sufficient for our clinical trials or commercial scale manufacturing 
we have entered into arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of some of our products 
our third party sourcing strategy may not result in a cost effective means for manufacturing products 
in employing third party manufacturers  we will not control many aspects of the manufacturing process  including compliance by these third parties with the fda s current good manufacturing practices and other regulatory requirements 
we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies from third party manufacturers in a timely fashion for development or commercialization purposes  and commercial quantities of products may not be available from contract manufacturers at acceptable costs 
pro is a recombinant protein  which generally involves more complex production methods than small molecule drugs 
manufacturing pro is challenging  and these challenges could increase the cost of production  delay product development or commercialization or otherwise adversely impact our ability to commercialize pro  should we choose to continue this program 
we are dependent on our patents and proprietary rights 
the validity  enforceability and commercial value of these rights are highly uncertain 
our success is dependent in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves many complex legal and technical issues 
there is no clear policy involving the breadth of claims allowed  or the degree of protection afforded  under patents in this area 
accordingly  the patent applications owned by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued 
we are aware of other groups that have claimed discoveries similar to those covered by our patent applications 
we do not expect to know for several years the relative strength of our patent position as compared to these other groups 
furthermore  patents that we own or license may not enable us to preclude competitors from commercializing drugs  and consequently may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantage 
we own or have licenses to several issued patents 
however  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability 
the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by the patent office can be challenged in litigation 
our patents may be successfully challenged 
moreover  we may incur substantial costs in litigation to uphold the validity of patents or to prevent infringement 
if the outcome of litigation is adverse to us  third parties may be able to use our patented invention without payment to us 
moreover  third parties may avoid our patents through design innovation 
generally  we have the right to defend and enforce patents licensed by us  either in the first instance or if the licensor chooses not to do so 
in addition  our license agreement with ur labs regarding mntx gives us the right to prosecute and maintain the licensed patents 
we bear the cost of engaging in some or all of these activities with respect to our license agreements with sloan kettering for gmk  columbia for pro and ur labs for mntx 
with most of our other license agreements  the licensor bears the cost of engaging in all of these activities  although we may share in those costs under specified circumstances 
historically  our costs of defending patent rights  both our own and those we license  have not been material 
we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our 
back to contents technology or disclose our technology  and we may be unable to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide effective protection in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information 
if we infringe third party patents  we may need to alter or terminate a product development program 
there may be patent rights belonging to others that require us to alter our products  pay licensing fees or cease certain activities 
if our products infringe patent rights of others  the patent owners could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products 
if these legal actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products 
we may not prevail in any action brought against us  and any license required under any patent that we infringe may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we are aware of intellectual property rights held by third parties that relate to products or technologies we are developing 
for example  we are aware of other groups investigating methylnaltrexone and other peripheral opioid antagonists  psma or related compounds and ccr monoclonal antibodies and of patents held  and patent applications filed  by these groups in those areas 
while the validity of issued patents  patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain  if asserted against us  any related patent rights could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products 
the research  development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical often involve alternative development and optimization routes  which are presented at various stages in the development process 
the preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend on subsequent discoveries and test results 
there are numerous third party patents in our field  and we may need to obtain a license to a patent in order to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products 
the need to obtain a license would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product 
if we cannot negotiate a license  we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether 
we are dependent on third parties for a variety of functions 
these arrangements may not provide us with the benefits we expect 
we rely in part on third parties to perform a variety of functions 
we are party to numerous agreements which place substantial responsibility on clinical research organizations  consultants and other service providers for the development of our products 
we also rely on medical and academic institutions to perform aspects of our clinical trials of product candidates 
in addition  an element of our research and development strategy is to in license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions in order to minimize investments in early research 
we may not be able to maintain any of these relationships or establish new ones on beneficial terms 
furthermore  we may not be able to enter new arrangements without undue delays or expenditures  and these arrangements may not allow us to compete successfully 
we lack sales and marketing experience  which will make us dependent on third parties for their expertise in this area 
we have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
if we receive marketing approval  we expect to market and sell our products  including mntx  principally through distribution  co marketing  co promotion or licensing arrangements with third parties 
we may also consider contracting with a third party professional pharmaceutical detailing and sales organization to perform the marketing function for our products 
we currently do not have a marketing partner for mntx 
to the extent that we enter into distribution  co marketing  co promotion  detailing or licensing arrangements for the marketing and sale of our products  any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of third parties 
we will not control the amount and timing of marketing resources these third parties devote to our products 
in addition  if we market products directly  significant additional expenditures and management resources would be required to develop an internal sales force 
we may not be able to establish a successful sales force should we choose to do so 

back to contents if we lose key management and scientific personnel on whom we depend  our business could suffer 
we are dependent upon our key management and scientific personnel 
in particular  the loss of dr 
paul j 
maddon  our chief executive officer and chief science officer  could cause our management and operations to suffer 
we have an employment agreement with dr 
maddon  the initial term of which runs through june   subject to an automatic renewal for an additional period of two years unless either party provides ninety days prior notice of non renewal 
see item executive compensation employment agreements 
we are currently in disucssions with dr 
maddon regarding the renewal of his employment agreement and expect that the agreement will be renewed 
employment agreements do not  however  assure the continued employment of an employee 
we maintain key man life insurance on dr 
maddon in the amount of million 
in october  our board of directors elected paul f 
jacobson and kurt w 
briner as co chairmen of the board in substitution of dr 
paul j 
maddon  our chief executive officer  chief science officer and a director 
dr 
maddon s employment agreement with us contains provisions relating to the chairmanship position 
we and dr 
maddon intend to negotiate an agreement to clarify that the change in the chairman position is not inconsistent with dr 
maddon s employment agreement with us 
ronald j 
prentki  our president and a director  notified us on march  of his resignation as an officer and director 
mr 
prentki has been responsible for our business development  corporate communications  finance  investor relations  legal and manufacturing and preclinical development functions 
we have no present intention to fill the executive position vacated by mr 
prentki 
this resignation will result in additional demands on dr 
maddon and our other senior executives 
competition for qualified employees among companies in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we may be required to expand substantially our personnel  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  regulatory affairs  business development and marketing 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the raw and bulk materials needed to make our products  our product development and commercialization could be slowed or stopped 
we currently obtain supplies of critical raw materials used in production of mntx  gmk and other of our product candidates from single sources 
in particular  we rely on single source third party manufacturers for the supply of both bulk and finished form mntx 
we have a supply agreement with mallinckrodt inc  our supplier of bulk form mntx  which has an initial term that expires on january  we do not have long term contracts with any of our other suppliers 
in addition  commercialization of gmk requires an adjuvant  qs  available only from antigenics inc our existing arrangements may not result in the supply of sufficient quantities of our product candidates needed to accomplish our clinical development programs  and we may not have the right or capability to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products to meet our needs if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to do so 
any delay or disruption in the availability of raw materials would slow or stop product development and commercialization of the relevant product 
a substantial portion of our funding comes from federal government grants and research contracts 
we cannot rely on these grants or contracts as a continuing source of funds 
a substantial portion of our revenues to date has been derived from federal government grants and research contracts 
in addition to previous years awards  in we were awarded  in the aggregate  approximately million in nih grants and research contracts 
we cannot rely on grants or additional contracts as a continuing source of funds 
moreover  funds available under these grants and contracts must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the government rather than for all our programs generally 
for example  the million contract awarded to us by the nih in september must be used by us in furtherance of our efforts to develop an hiv vaccine 
the government s obligation to make payments under these grants and contracts is subject to appropriation by the us congress for funding in each year 
moreover  it is possible that congress or the government agencies that administer these government research programs will decide to scale back these programs or terminate them due to their own budgetary constraints 
additionally  these grants and research contracts are subject to adjustment based upon the results of periodic audits performed on behalf of the granting authority 
consequently  the government may not award grants or research contracts to us in the future  and any amounts that we derive from existing grants or contracts may be less than those received to date 
if health care reform measures are enacted  our operating results and our ability to commercialize products could be adversely affected 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the health care system in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for 
back to contents medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
in some foreign countries  particularly countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
in addition  as a result of the trend towards managed health care in the us  as well as legislative proposals to reduce government insurance programs  third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drug products 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
if we or any of our collaborators succeed in bringing one or more of our products to market  third party payors may establish and maintain price levels insufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
significant changes in the health care system in the us or elsewhere  including changes resulting from adverse trends in third party reimbursement programs  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to raise capital and commercialize products 
we are exposed to product liability claims  and in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance against these claims at a reasonable cost or at all 
our business exposes us to product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
we may not be able to avoid product liability exposure 
if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us  our financial position may be adversely affected 
product liability insurance for the biopharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  when available at all 
we have obtained product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a deductible and a million aggregate limitation 
in addition  where local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or where local policies of insurance are required  we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements 
our present insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims brought against us 
in addition  some of our license and other agreements require us to obtain product liability insurance 
adequate insurance coverage may not be available to us at a reasonable cost in the future 
we handle hazardous materials and must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive and restrict how we do business 
if we are involved in a hazardous waste spill or other accident  we could be liable for damages  penalties or other forms of censure 
our research and development work and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous  controlled and radioactive materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
despite procedures that we implement for handling and disposing of these materials  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
in the event of a hazardous waste spill or other accident  we could be liable for damages  penalties or other forms of censure 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
our stock price has a history of volatility 
you should consider an investment in our stock as risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss 
our stock price has a history of significant volatility 
between january  and december   our stock price has ranged from to per share 
at times  our stock price has been volatile even in the absence of significant news or developments relating to us 
moreover  the stocks of biotechnology companies and the stock market generally have been subject to dramatic price swings in recent years 
factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials involving our products or those of our competitors  changes in the status of any of our drug development programs  including delays in clinical trials or program terminations  developments regarding our efforts to achieve marketing approval for our products  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us  our collaborators or our competitors

our principal stockholders are able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval 
dr 
maddon and stockholders affiliated with tudor investment corporation together beneficially own or control approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
these persons  should they choose to act together  could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control our business 
this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us and  consequently  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions may make the removal of our board of directors or management more difficult and discourage hostile bids for control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors is authorized  without further stockholder action  to issue from time to time shares of preferred stock in one or more designated series or classes 
the issuance of preferred stock  as well as provisions in certain of our stock options that provide for acceleration of exercisability upon a change of control  and section and other provisions of the delaware general corporation law could make the takeover of progenics or the removal of our board of directors or management more difficult  discourage hostile bids for control of progenics in which stockholders may receive a premium for their shares of common stock  and otherwise dilute the rights of holders of our common stock and depress the market price of our common stock 
if there are substantial sales of common stock  the market price of our common stock could decline 
sales of substantial numbers of shares of common stock could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
some of our stockholders are entitled to require us to register their shares of common stock for offer or sale to the public 
we have filed form s registration statements registering shares issuable pursuant to our equity compensation plans

back to contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products to treat the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
we commenced principal operations in late  and since that time we have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  development of our manufacturing capabilities  establishment of corporate collaborations and raising capital 
we do not currently have any commercial products 
in order to commercialize the principal products that we have under development  we will need to address a number of technological and clinical challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of funds that we will require  or the length of time that will pass  before we receive significant revenues from sales of any of our products 
we may never achieve significant product sales 
to date  our product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
we expect that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 
our other sources of revenues through december  have been payments received under our former collaboration agreements and from psma development company llc  our joint venture with cytogen corporation  research grants and contracts related to our cancer and hiv programs and interest income 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly as our programs progress and we make filings with regulators for approval to market our product candidates 
our most advanced product candidate and likeliest source of product revenue is methylnaltrexone mntx 
we are conducting a broad clinical development program for mntx in several settings involving symptom management and supportive care 
it is likely that we will need to complete successfully both of our two phase clinical trials of mntx  in which we are evaluating mntx as a treatment for opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced medical illness  in order to obtain regulatory approval to market mntx 
we completed patient enrollment in the first of these trials  which we call the trial  in the fourth quarter of and subsequently announced positive top line results 
we anticipate completion of patient enrollment in the second trial  which we call the trial  in mid year assuming we accomplish this objective and the data are positive  we could file with the us food and drug administration fda a new drug application nda for marketing approval for mntx for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced medical illness as early as the end of we expect that it would take at least six months for the fda to act on our application 

back to contents we are also developing mntx for the management of post operative bowel dysfunction  a serious paralysis of the gastrointestinal tract 
we have completed a phase clinical trial of mntx for this indication 
we completed enrollment for the trial  which we call the trial  in the fourth quarter of and announced positive top line results in january we plan to complete a more in depth analysis of the data and meet with the fda in to discuss designing a phase clinical program 
we are also developing oral mntx for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with chronic pain and have completed phase clinical trials of oral mntx in healthy volunteers 
we plan to initiate in phase clinical studies of oral mntx in chronic pain patients who experience opioid induced constipation 
the statements above as to our expectations for achieving various milestones are forward looking statements 
there are a variety of factors that may prevent us from achieving these milestones within the timeframes suggested  or at all  including a continuation in delays we have experienced in the past in enrolling patients  the inherent uncertainties associated with seeking marketing approvals from the fda and the other factors described herein under the caption item business risk factors 
with the exception of the years ended december  and  we have had recurring losses and had  at december   an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million 
during the year then ended  we had a net loss of million and used cash in operating activities of million 
we do not anticipate generating significant recurring revenues  from product sales or otherwise  in the near term  and we expect our expenses to increase 
consequently  we will require significant additional external funding in the near term to continue our operations at their current levels 
we have developed a contingency plan  which provides for changes in our operations in the event that we are unable to secure additional funding in the near term 
we would likely commence implementing this plan in the second quarter of if we are not able to secure additional funding by such time 
the contingency plan would include curtailing significantly one or more of our product development programs and engaging in other cost containment initiatives

joint venture with cytogen corporation 
we have a interest in our joint venture with cytogen corporation 
we were required to fund the first million of the joint venture s research and development costs 
prior to reaching million of such costs  we recognized reimbursements on a net basis and did not recognize any revenue from the joint venture 
during the fourth quarter of  we surpassed the million threshold  at which time we began recognizing revenue for services and costs being provided to and paid by the joint venture 
our revenues from the joint venture do not result in significant net cash flows to us  since they are relatively minor in comparison to our expenses and because they are offset in part by capital contributions that we must make to the joint venture 
under our agreement with cytogen  we were required to pay to the joint venture million in supplemental capital contributions at certain defined dates or upon the achievement by the joint venture of defined milestones 
since it was probable that we would be required to fund the million supplemental capital contribution  on june  we recorded a liability to the joint venture of approximately million 
such amount represented the present value of the supplemental capital contributions discounted at 
the discount was amortized as interest expense over the term of the remaining payments 
one million dollars was paid in and million was paid during each of and the joint venture s research and development programs and other operations are conducted on its behalf by us  cytogen and third party providers 
we and cytogen are compensated by the joint venture for our services provided to the joint venture 
from june through january  our services to the joint venture were provided pursuant to the terms of a services agreement 
this services agreement  as extended  expired effective january  although both parties have continued to provide services to the joint venture subsequent to january and have been compensated for these services  we and cytogen have not yet agreed upon the terms of a replacement services agreement 
the level of future revenues we derive from the joint venture will depend on the nature and amount of research and development services requested of us by the joint venture as well as the future financial position of the joint venture 
our and cytogen s respective levels of commitment to fund the joint venture is based on a budget and work plan that are developed annually by the parties 
the budget is intended to be sufficient to fund research and development projects for the then current year 
we have in the past experienced delays in reaching agreement with 
back to contents cytogen regarding budget issues and strategic and operational matters relating to the joint venture 
the joint venture currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to the joint venture 
if we do not reach an agreement regarding the budget and work plan  the programs conducted by the joint venture would likely be delayed or halted  and our capital commitments to  and revenues associated with  the joint venture would be reduced or eliminated 
we may not reach an agreement with cytogen on these matters 
according to the joint venture agreement  and in consideration of our initial incremental capital contribution and recognition of million of joint venture research expenditures  we may directly pursue and obtain government grants directed to the conduct of research utilizing psma related technologies and retain related amounts not to exceed million 
through december   we had recognized approximately million of revenue from eight governmental grants relating to psma technologies 
this million is included in grant revenue in our accompanying financial statements 
proceeds received from the joint venture for research activities for which we have also received corresponding grant revenue is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as adjustments to reduce to joint venture losses and contract revenue from the joint venture 
such adjustments were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations amounts in thousands years ended december  and revenues we recognized  and  of revenue for research and development services performed for the joint venture during and  respectively 
proceeds received from grants related to the joint venture and for which we have also been compensated by the joint venture for services provided were in and in as described above  we have reflected in the accompanying financial statements adjustments to decrease joint venture losses and decrease contract revenue from the joint venture in respect of such amounts 
we and the joint venture have applied for additional grant funding 
revenues from research grants and contracts increased from  in to  in the increase resulted from the funding of a greater number of grants and contracts in additionally  in september  we were awarded a contract by the national institutes of health the nih contract 
the nih contract provides for up to  in funding to us over five years for preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a vaccine designed to prevent hiv from infecting individuals exposed to the virus 
our scientists are the principal investigators under the contract and head the vaccine development effort 
existing academic collaborators of ours head the vaccine design and animal testing core groups under a subcontract 
a total of approximately  is earmarked under the nih contract to fund such subcontracts 
funding under the nih contract is subject to compliance with its terms  and the payment of an aggregate of  in fees is subject to achievement of specified milestones 
based on our currently approved grants  the nih contract  and planned grant submissions  we expect revenues from grants and contracts to remain at the current level or increase somewhat over the next five years 
expenses research and development expenses include scientific labor  supplies  facility costs  clinical trial costs  and product manufacturing costs 
in late  we in licensed mntx 
a major portion of our spending has been  and we expect will continue to be  associated with this product candidate 
research and development expenses increased  from  in to  in during  such expenses consisted of approximately  of salaries and benefits   of clinical trial costs   in laboratory supplies   for operating expenses  including rent and other facilities costs  insurance and travel   for contract manufacturing and subcontractors   for consultants  and in license fees 
increases year over year included  in clinical trial costs  primarily for mntx  
back to contents  in salaries and benefits related to company wide compensation increases as well as an increase in headcount from in to in in the research and development  manufacturing and medical departments   in operating expenses  in consultants related to mntx  in laboratory supplies  of which related to hiv programs  related to the gmk program and related to other  non mntx programs  and in contract manufacturing and subcontractor costs related to mntx 
these increases were offset in part by decreases of  in contract manufacturing and subcontractor costs  in laboratory supplies for mntx  in license fees  for mntx and related to our hiv programs  and in consulting fees 
we expect to incur significant increases in research and development costs related to mntx as the clinical programs expand and progress 
these expenses would be reduced if we enter into a collaboration for mntx in which the collaborator assumes financial responsibility for future development of mntx  or if we choose not to advance all of our mntx programs 
spending in other programs is expected to remain relatively stable 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in the  increase was principally due to increases of related to an increase in administrative headcount   in professional fees including patent costs  recruiting and audit related fees including  related to compliance with newly implemented requirements concerning internal controls over financial reporting  in operating expenses including rent  insurance  travel and office supplies  in consulting costs  and in franchise taxes 
loss in joint venture decreased from  in to  in as further described above  we recognized and in and  respectively  of payments received from the joint venture as a reduction to joint venture losses and contract revenue from the joint venture 
depreciation and amortization increased from  in to  in as we purchased capital assets and made leasehold improvements in to increase our manufacturing capacity 
other income expense interest income increased from in to in as cash available for investing increased year over year 
in november  we completed a public offering of  shares common stock which provided  net of expenses 
we recognized a loss of on the sale of marketable securities 
net loss our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of  in 
back to contents years ended december  and revenues we recognized  and  of revenue for research and development services performed for the jv during and  respectively 
approximately  of the amount recognized in represents reimbursement for third party expense paid by us 
proceeds received from the joint venture for research activities for which we have also received corresponding grant revenue were in and in other contract research and development revenue declined from in to in as our commitments for such work were completed 
revenues from research grants and contracts increased from  in to  in the increase resulted from the funding of a greater number of grants and the nih contract awarded in september expenses research and development expenses increased from  in to  in during  such expenses consisted of approximately  of salaries and benefits   in laboratory supplies   for clinical trial costs   for contract manufacturing and subcontractors   for operating expenses  including rent and other facilities costs  insurance and travel  in license fees  and for consultants 
the increase of  year over year was principally due to increases of  in manufacturing supplies and clinical trial costs for mntx   related to an increase in salaries and benefits related to company wide compensation increases as well as an increase in headcount from in to in in the research and development  manufacturing and medical departments  in manufacturing supplies for pro  in operating expenses  and in contract research expense 
these increases were offset in part by decreases of  in psma supplies purchase for the joint venture such supplies were purchased directly by the joint venture in  in contract manufacturing and laboratory supplies for pro  in general laboratory supplies and miscellaneous  in manufacturing supplies and clinical trial costs for gmk  in subcontractor costs under grants and contracts  in supplies and consulting costs for a discontinued research program  and in license fees 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in the  increase was principally due to increases of related to an increase in administrative headcount  in professional fees including patent costs  recruiting and audit related fees  in operating expenses including rent  insurance and office supplies  and 
back to contents in consulting costs and franchise taxes 
loss in joint venture decreased from  in to  in as further described above  during  we recognized approximately of payments received from the joint venture as an adjustment to joint venture losses rather than contract revenue from the joint venture 
depreciation and amortization increased from  in to  in as we purchased capital assets and made leasehold improvements in to accommodate expansion 
other income expense interest income decreased from  in to in as cash available for investing decreased and interest rates declined year over year 
during  we received a  payment from an insurance settlement related to a heat excursion in our storage facility 
net loss our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources we have to date generated no meaningful amounts of recurring revenue  and consequently we have relied principally on external funding to finance our operations 
we have funded our operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  loans that were subsequently converted into equity securities  a line of credit that was repaid and terminated  payments received under collaboration agreements  three public offerings of common stock  funding under government research grants and contracts  interest on investments and the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in november  we completed our third public offering of common stock which provided us with million in net proceeds 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million compared with million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the same period in the increase of million in net cash used in operations for the year ended december  over the previous year resulted primarily from an increase in our net loss of million to million for the year ended december   impacted by i an increase of in non cash depreciation and amortization resulting from the purchase of fixed assets and leasehold improvements for our expanded manufacturing capacity  ii an increase of of non cash amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the issuance of restricted stock in to employees  iii a decrease in adjusted loss in jv of resulting from decreased activity in the jv programs  iv and a decrease of  of capital contributions to jv for the same reason 
additionally  the net impact of our changes in assets and liabilities was of cash used in operating activities  primarily due to i an increase in other current assets which includes amounts due from espp and stock option exercises  and ii an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due increased costs of clinical trials and sarbanes oxley compliance 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million of net cash used in investing activities for the same period in net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of million of marketable securities offset by the purchase of million of marketable securities and the purchase of million of fixed assets including capital equipment and leasehold improvements as we acquired and built out additional manufacturing space 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared with million for the same period in the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects the exercise of stock options under our employee stock option plans and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 
during  we expect that cash received from exercises under such plans will increase due to increased headcount 
the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects i the completion of a public offering of million shares of common stock  which provided million  net of expenses  and ii the exercise of stock options under our employee stock option plan and the sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase plans  which provided million 
under the terms of our joint venture with cytogen  we are required to make capital contributions to fund of the spending on the psma projects 
such amount was million during we and cytogen each contributed an additional  subsequent to december  to fund the obligations outstanding related to work performed in under the approved budget and work plan 
our and cytogen s level of commitment to fund the joint venture is based on a budget that is developed annually by the parties 
we were required to fund the initial cost of the research and development up to million 
as of december   we 
back to contents had satisfied our initial million funding requirement 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of contract research and development revenue for services performed on behalf of the joint venture 
our revenues from the joint venture do not result in significant net cash flows to us  since they are relatively minor in comparison to our expenses and because they are offset in part by capital contributions that we must make to the joint venture 
the joint venture currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to the joint venture 
until we reach agreement with cytogen regarding the budget and work plan  we will not know what  if any  commitment we will have to the joint venture to fund psma projects 
based on our discussions with cytogen to date  we expect that a commitment on our part in the range of million to million is likely  assuming we reach agreement 
if we do not reach an agreement regarding the budget and work plan  our capital commitments to  and our revenues associated with  the joint venture would be reduced or eliminated 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we currently have major research and development programs investigating symptom management and supportive care  hiv related diseases and cancer 
in addition  we are conducting several smaller research projects in the areas of virology and cancer 
for various reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials and our dependence in certain instances on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete our research and development programs 
if we do not enter into a collaboration pursuant to which our partner assumes financial responsibility for further development  and we proceed with each of our mntx programs  we expect that our spending on mntx will increase significantly in we expect that spending on other programs will remain relatively stable in for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred were as follows see results of operations expenses in millions mntx hiv cancer other programs total in september  we were awarded a contract by the national institutes of health the nih contract 
the nih contract provides for up to million in funding  subject to annual funding approvals  to us over five years for preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
we anticipate that these funds will be used principally in connection with our provax hiv vaccine program 
our scientists are the principal investigators under the contract and head the vaccine development effort 
existing academic collaborators of ours head the vaccine design and animal testing core groups under a subcontract 
a total of approximately million is earmarked under the nih contract to fund such subcontracts 
funding under the nih contract is subject to compliance with its terms  and the payment of an aggregate of million in fees is subject to achievement of specified milestones 
through december   we had recognized revenue of million from this contract  including  for the achievement of a milestone 
other than currently approved grants and contracts  we have no committed external sources of capital  and other than potential revenues from mntx  which could occur as early as late  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our products to the commercial marketing stage 

back to contents in  we filed a form s shelf registration with the sec which permits us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
we have not sold any shares under this shelf registration 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million 
during the year then ended  we had a net loss of million and used cash in operating activities of million 
we anticipate significant increases in expenditures as we continue to expand our research and development activities  particularly in our mntx programs 
consequently  we will require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  for the cost of product in licensing and for any possible acquisitions  and we may require additional funding to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
we intend to fund our operations over the next months with our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as through funding from potential collaboration agreements with one or more pharmaceutical companies and from the issuance and sale of securities 
we are currently in negotiations with potential collaborators for the mntx programs  and we are seeking to finalize a collaboration agreement in we expect that such a collaboration arrangement would include significant up front license fees or other payments as well as milestone payments 
we also expect that a collaborator would assume financial responsibility for further clinical development and commercialization of a majority of the mntx programs 
we may also enter into a collaboration agreement with respect to other of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty  however  which products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  or how such arrangements would affect our capital requirements 
we may also seek to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other securities 
in doing so  we may utilize our previously filed shelf registration statement described above 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to complete any securities transactions 
we may also seek to fund aspects of our operations through government grants and contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we have developed a contingency plan  which provides for changes in our operations in the event that we are unable to secure additional funding in the near term 
we would likely commence implementing this plan in the second quarter of if we are not able to secure additional funding by such time 
this plan would include focusing our resources on our late stage mntx program  which we believe has the greatest likelihood of generating near term cash flows  and reducing or eliminating funding to some or all of our other product development programs 
there are other cost containment initiatives that we could implement 
we believe that these measures would significantly reduce our operating expenses 
the impact of these cost savings initiatives on our operating results would likely be modest initially and then increase as the measures are phased in over time 
we believe that implementation of this contingency plan would permit us to conduct our operations  funded by our existing capital resources  for at least the next twelve months 
these steps would likely adversely impact our prospects for product commercialization and  consequently  our prospects for product sales and profitability 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us would seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
for periods beyond months  we may seek additional financing to fund operations through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to the development of our technologies 
we also plan to seek funding from additional grants and government contracts 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds from these sources on acceptable terms  if at all 
also  if mntx receives regulatory approval  we could achieve cash flows from product sales  perhaps as early as late we will require substantial funds to continue to conduct research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other general and administrative activities 
our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases and licensing and collaboration agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under these agreements 
back to contents payments due by period total less than one year to years to years greater than years in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements assumes attainment of milestones covered under each agreement 
the timing of the achievement of the related milestones is highly uncertain  and accordingly the actual timing of payments  if any  is likely to vary  perhaps significantly  relative to the timing contemplated by this table 
this table does not reflect the payment obligations of our joint venture with cytogen 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
for example  we plan to make a decision regarding the ongoing feasibility of our pro hiv program after reviewing the results of our ongoing phase ii clinical trial  which we expect to occur in the second half of certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development of these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and adversely impact our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships with  or new relationships with  licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be changes that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development as we perform services  provided a contractual agreement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and our collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in situations where we receive payment in advance of the performance of services  these amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as we perform the related services 
non refundable fees  including payments we receive for services  are recognized as revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete and total expected contract revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue recognition of long term power sales contracts  which is a systematic method that is representative of the revenue earned or obligations fulfilled under these arrangements 
however  the revenue we recognize is limited to the amount of non refundable fees received 
with regard to our revenues from non refundable fees  changes in estimates of our costs to complete could have a material impact on the revenues we recognize 
we have been awarded government research grants and contracts from the national institutes of health the nih 
the nih grants and contracts are used to subsidize our research projects projects 
nih grant revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis as subsidized project costs are incurred 
such method approximates the straight line basis over the lives of the projects 
the nih contract  awarded in september  reimburses the company for costs associated with the preclinical research  development and early clinical 
back to contents testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus as requested by the nih 
for the year ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  of grant and contract revenue 
in connection with the formation of our joint venture with cytogen  we funded the first million of research and development costs incurred on behalf of the joint venture 
prior to reaching million of such costs  we recognized reimbursements on a net basis and did not recognize any revenue from the joint venture 
subsequent to our having funded million of research and development costs  which occurred in the fourth quarter of  both we and cytogen became required to fund the joint venture equally to support ongoing research and development efforts conducted by us on behalf of the joint venture 
accordingly  subsequent to our providing the initial million in funding  we recognized payments for research and development as revenue 
for the year ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  of contract research and development revenue for services performed on behalf of the joint venture 
a portion of these revenues was reimbursement for costs expended to outside parties 
beginning in  all costs to outside parties were paid directly by the joint venture 
according to the joint venture agreement  and in consideration of our initial incremental capital contribution and recognition of million of joint venture research expenditures  we may directly pursue and obtain government grants directed to the conduct of research utilizing psma related technologies and retain related amounts not to exceed million 
proceeds received from the joint venture for research activities for which we have also received corresponding grant revenue is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as adjustments to joint venture losses and contract revenue from the joint venture 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
we expect that clinical trial expenses will increase significantly in as many clinical trials progress or are initiated in the mntx and hiv programs 
a collaboration agreement regarding mntx in which the collaborator assumes financial responsibility for further development would mitigate these costs 
stock based compensation we have historically prepared our financial statements in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

in accordance with apb no 
 generally  we have not recognized compensation expense in connection with the awarding of common stock option grants to employees provided that  as of the grant date  all terms associated with the award are fixed and the fair value of our common stock  as of the grant date  is equal to or less than the exercise price 
we recognize compensation expense if the terms of an option grant are not fixed or the quoted market price of our common stock on the grant date is greater than the exercise price 
we also recognize compensation expense for performance based vesting of stock options upon achievement of defined milestones 
the fair value of options and warrants granted to non employees for services are included in the financial statements and expensed as they vest

historically  in accordance with sfas and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we had elected to follow the disclosure only provisions of statement no 
and  accordingly continue to account for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock price on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements  and compensation expense is only disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
we will be required to adopt statement no
