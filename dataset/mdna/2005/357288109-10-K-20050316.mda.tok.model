item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general fremont general corporation fremont general or when combined with its subsidiaries the company is a holding company which is engaged in lending operations through its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary  fremont investment loan fil 
fil is a california state chartered industrial bank 
fremont general is not a bank holding company as defined for regulatory purposes 
fil has two primary lending operations  commercial and residential real estate  both of which are done on a nationwide basis 
fil s commercial real estate lending operation includes nine regional offices and  as of december   had loans outstanding in states 
the residential real estate lending platform originated loans from states through its five regional loan production centers during the fourth quarter of fil funds its operations primarily through deposit accounts sourced in california that are insured up to the maximum legal limit by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  and to a lesser extent  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb 
as such  fil is regulated by the fdic and the department of financial institutions of the state of california dfi 
fil s residential real estate lending operation originates first  and to a lesser degree  second mortgage loans on a wholesale basis through a network of independent mortgage brokers 
fil offers mortgage products that are designed for borrowers who do not generally satisfy the credit  documentation or other underwriting standards prescribed by conventional mortgage lenders  such as fannie mae and freddie mac and are commonly referred to as non prime or sub prime 
these borrowers generally have considerable equity in the properties securing their loans  but have impaired or limited credit profiles or higher debt to income ratios than conventional mortgage lenders allow 
the borrowers also include individuals who  due to self employment or other circumstances  have difficulty documenting their income through conventional means 
fil seeks to mitigate its exposure to credit risk through underwriting standards that strive to ensure appropriate loan to collateral valuations 
all of the loans that fil originates are currently either sold in whole loan sales to various financial institutions  or to a lesser extent  securitized and sold to various investors 
the company has retained some of these loans as held for investment in prior periods and may do so again in the future 
fil s commercial real estate lending operation provides first mortgage financing on various types of income producing properties 
the loans that fil originates are substantially all held for investment  with some loans participated out to reduce credit limit exposures 
loans are originated through broker and borrower relationships and the borrowers are typically mid size developers and owners seeking a loan structure that provides limited recourse and is short term  providing bridge or construction financing for comprehensive construction  renovation  repositioning and lease up of existing or new properties 
to manage the credit risk involved in this lending  fil is focused on the value and quality of the collateral and the quality and experience of the parties with whom it does business 
the size of loan commitments originated generally range from million to million  with some loans for larger amounts 
the company s two operating lines of business are designed to be somewhat counter cyclical and to provide balance in varying economic cycles  however  both of the company s operating businesses are influenced by the overall condition of the economy  in particular the interest rate environment and  as a result  experience cyclicality in volume  loan losses and earnings 
the company strives to manage its operations so as to optimize operational efficiency and to maintain risks within acceptable parameters 
the company s lending operations generate income as follows all of the residential real estate loans originated are currently sold for varying levels of gain through whole loan sales to other financial institutions  and to a lesser degree  to various investors through securitization transactions 
a held for sale valuation reserve  a loan repurchase reserve and a premium recapture reserve are maintained through provisions expense that are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
commercial real estate loans  which are held for investment  generate net interest income on the difference between the rates charged on the loans and the cost of borrowed funds 
an allowance for 
table of contents loan losses is maintained through provisions expense that are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the principal market risks the company faces are interest rate risk  which is the risk that the valuation of the company s interest sensitive loans and liabilities and its net interest income will change due to changes in interest rates  and liquidity risk  which is the ability of the company to access the necessary funding and capital resources  in a cost effective manner  to fund its loan originations or to sell its loans held for sale 
the company endeavors to mitigate interest rate risk by attempting to match the rate reset or repricing characteristics of its assets with its liabilities 
the company also utilizes forward loan sale commitments to provide liquidity and to hedge its residential mortgage loan pipeline and loans held for sale  as well as interest rate caps to hedge execution of its securitization transactions 
the objective of our interest rate and liquidity risk management activities is to reduce the risk of operational disruption and to reduce the volatility in income caused by changes in interest rates  however  the mortgage banking industry is inherently subject to income volatility due to the effect of interest rate variations on loan production volume  premiums realized on loan sales and securitizations  and loan pre payment patterns  which in turn affects the valuation of the company s residual interests and mortgage servicing rights  as well as the amount of loan servicing income realized 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under item and the business section presented under item results of operations the company reported net income of million for as compared to million and million for and  respectively

non interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately 
the primary driver of this increase over the prior year was the additional compensation and related organizational expenses incurred to support the substantial increase in residential real estate loan origination volume

discontinued insurance operations the property and casualty insurance operation  which was primarily represented by the underwriting of workers compensation insurance policies  was classified as discontinued during the fourth quarter of the intention at that time was to allow the liabilities primarily loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to the discontinued insurance business to run off and  as a result  the property and casualty insurance operation was accounted for as a discontinued operation using the liquidation basis of accounting 
accordingly  the company s operating results for and prior periods were restated to reflect reporting in this manner for all periods presented 
in july  fremont general and its discontinued workers compensation insurance subsidiary  fremont indemnity company fremont indemnity entered into an agreement the agreement with the california department of insurance the doi that allowed fremont indemnity  with the oversight of the doi  to self administer the run off of its operations by paying claims and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business and also preserve the company s net operating loss carryforwards attributable to fremont indemnity

table of contents while fremont general owns of the common stock of fremont indemnity  its assets and liabilities are excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the company no longer has effective control over the operation of this subsidiary 
for additional detail on the discontinuance of the property and casualty insurance operation see note t of notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk the company is subject to market risk resulting primarily from fluctuations in interest rates arising from balance sheet financial instruments such as investments  loans and debt 
changes in interest rates can affect loan interest income  gains on the sale of residential real estate loans  interest expense  loan origination volume  net investment income  and total stockholders equity 
the level of gain on the sale of residential real estate loans is highly dependent upon the level of loan origination volume and the net premium paid by the purchasers of such loans 
both the volume and net premium  in turn  are highly dependent upon changes in  and the level of  interest rates and other economic factors 
the company may experience a decrease in the amount of net gain it realizes should significant interest rate increases occur or if other economic factors have a negative impact on the value and volume of the loans the company originates 
the objective of the asset and liability management activities is to provide the highest level of net interest and investment income and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
there is no exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk resulting from differences between the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest earning loans held for investment and loans held for sale and the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest bearing liabilities used to finance its loans such as deposits and debt 
interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree  earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in the loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations 
the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates and utilizes various derivative financial instruments to meet these objectives 
for the company s financial instruments  the expected maturity date does not necessarily reflect the net market risk exposure because certain instruments are subject to interest rate changes before expected maturity 
with respect to the company s residential real estate loans held for sale and its unfunded loan pipeline  the company attempts to minimize its interest rate risk exposure through forward loan sale commitments and other derivatives  such as eurodollar futures contracts 
these derivatives meet the definition of a derivative under generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  they are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the company is reliant upon the secondary mortgage market for execution of its whole loan sales and securitizations of residential real estate loans 
while the company strives to maintain adequate levels of liquidity support and capital to withstand certain disruptions in the secondary mortgage market  a significant disruption could adversely impact the company s ability to fund  sell  securitize or finance its residential real estate loan origination volume  leading to reduced gains on sale and a corresponding decrease in revenue and earnings 
a deterioration in performance of the residential real estate loans after being sold in whole loan sales and securitizations could adversely impact the availability and pricing of such future transactions

off balance sheet activities the company in continued to securitize its residential real estate loans 
securitization is a process of transforming the loans into securities  which are sold to investors 
the loans are sold to a qualifying special purpose entity a qspe which is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly known as asset backed securities  that are secured by the future cash flows to be derived from the sold loans 
the qspe uses the proceeds from the issuance of the securities to pay the purchase price of the sold loans 
the company does not utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities as a mechanism to remove non performing assets from the consolidated balance sheets 
securitization is used by the company to provide an additional source of liquidity 
the qspes are not consolidated into the company s financial statements since they meet the criteria established by sfas no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
in general  those criteria require the qspe to be isolated and distinct from the transferor the company  be limited to permitted activities  and have defined limits on the assets it can hold and the permitted sales  exchanges or distributions of its assets 
during  the company securitized billion in residential real estate loans 
the investors and the qspes do not have any recourse to the company if the cash flows generated by the sold loans are inadequate to service the securities issued by the qspes 
at the close of each securitization  the company removes from its balance sheet the carrying value of the loans sold and adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair value of the assets obtained in consideration for the loans which generally include the cash received net of transaction expenses  retained junior class securities referred to as residual interests and mortgage servicing rights 
additional information concerning the company s securitization activities is included in notes a  f  g  and h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations and commitments related to its debt  preferred securities and operating leases for premises and equipment 
the contractual obligations at december  are summarized by contractual maturity in the following table payments due by period less than more than total year years years years thousands of dollars fhlb advances senior notes due lyons due junior subordinated debentures preferred securities total debt operating lease obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
gain on whole loan sales and securitizations the company recognizes net gains or losses on whole loan sales and securitizations of its residential real estate loans at the date of settlement and when the company has transferred control over the loans to either a third party purchaser or to a securitization transaction 
the amount of gain or loss for whole loan sales is based upon the difference between the net cash received for the loans and the allocated carrying value of the loans 
the company primarily sells its whole loans on a servicing released basis and the net cash received includes a premium for the mortgage servicing rights 
in a securitization transaction  the company typically retains the mortgage servicing rights and a gain is recognized to the extent that the net selling price based upon the allocated fair values of the assets obtained at the date of transfer exceeds the carrying value of the loans sold 
the company structures each securitization transaction to meet the sale requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and  as a result  at the closing of each securitization  the company removes from its balance sheet the carrying value of the loans held for sale and adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair value of the assets obtained from the sale of loans through the securitization transaction which generally include the cash received net of transaction expenses  retained junior class interests residual interests in securitized loans  and mortgage servicing rights 
the carrying value of the loans sold generally is loan principal balance plus the direct costs of origination  less the net amount of fees received from the borrower 
concurrent with a securitization transaction  the company monetizes its retained residual interests through the issuance of net interest margin securities or nims 
the retained residual interests represent certain excess cash flows and pre payment fees from the securitization transaction  these cash flows serve as the collateralization for issuing the nims 
the retained residual interests are sold to a qspe a nim trust or llc from which interest bearing notes are issued 
the cash flow from the retained residual interests pays down the nim notes until they are paid in full  the company retains an interest which entitles it to receive the cash flow coming to the nim trust or llc after the nim notes have been extinguished 
the combination of the securitization transaction and the nim transaction enabled the company to generate upfront cash flow in excess of its carrying value of the loans sold 
the company values the retained interest in the nim transaction at fair value utilizing various assumptions that are inherently subject to volatility  such as anticipated pre payments of the loans  estimated credit losses and interest rate projections  and thus the value of the retained interest may exhibit variation as economic conditions fluctuate 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to adequately provide for known and probable losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses in the consolidated statement of operations and reduced by charge offs of loan balances related to specific loans 
the company utilizes a systematic methodology for determining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
management s methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance encompasses a variety of risk assumptions  both quantitative and qualitative  and the process includes a periodic loan by loan review of loans that are individually evaluated for impairment as well as detailed reviews of other loans  either individually or in pools 
quantitative factors include historical loss experience by property type and geographic market  delinquency trends  collateral values  specific problem loans  trends in problem and potential problem loans  and other relevant factors 
qualitative factors include 
table of contents prevailing and anticipated economic trends regionally  nationally and by industry  trends in volume  size and terms of loans  changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  loan concentrations geographic  property type and industry  and other relevant factors 
while this methodology utilizes historical and other objective information deemed to warrant recognition in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  the adequacy of the allowance is subject to variation as conditions change 
derivatives the company utilizes various derivative financial instruments in connection with its interest rate risk management activities and  as of december   utilized a combination of forward sales commitments and eurodollar futures contracts to hedge its residential loans held for sale and a certain portion of its unfunded pipeline 
the company s forward sales commitments represent obligations to sell loans at a specific price and date in the future 
the value of these commitments increases as interest rates increase 
short eurodollar futures contracts are standardized exchange traded contracts  the value of which is tied to spot eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the value of these futures contracts increase when interest rates increase 
these derivatives are intended to reduce the risk of adverse fair value changes in certain interest rate environments 
as established by sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  derivative financial instruments are reported at their fair value 
the company distinguishes commitments to sell forward loans in two categories  allocated and general 
allocated forward sales commitments are contractual sales agreements whereby a specific pool of loans is agreed upon to be sold to specific buyers at a contractually agreed upon date and price 
the allocated sales commitments are accounted for as fair value hedges designated to specific pools of loans that have been contractually agreed upon for sale 
general forward sales commitments are currently treated as economic hedges not designated as accounting hedges and are classified as free standing derivatives 
the company s eurodollar futures contracts are currently treated as economic hedges not designated as accounting hedges and are classified as free standing derivatives 
in addition  the company conditionally quotes interest rates to potential borrowers  which are then subject to adjustment by the company if any such conditions are not satisfied 
since the company generally funds the loans at the rate lock commitments  which generally are for days  they are treated as free standing derivatives and are carried at their estimated fair value 
interest rate lock commitments are valued at zero at inception 
income taxes the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of the deferred tax assets is in part dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
the gain inherent in the company s loans held for sale has been recognized into taxable income in periods prior to being recognized into gaap income 
therefore  when the loans held for sale are ultimately sold  there will be no tax paid on the gain per gaap since the taxable gain was recognized in a previous period 
deferred tax assets relating to the allowance for loan losses are dependent on future taxable income to offset the deductions which are expected to arise when the loans relating to the allowance are ultimately charged off 
management s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  loan loss experience  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
new accounting standards in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
the company adopted the provisions of sop effective january  and does not believe that the adoption of sop will have a significant impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 

table of contents in march  the united states securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no

this bulletin summarizes the views of the staff regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments 
the provisions of sab are applicable to loan commitments accounted for as derivatives and entered into subsequent to april  under sab  it is determined that an interest rate lock commitment should generally be valued at zero at inception 
the rate locks will continue to be adjusted for changes in value resulting from changes in market interest rates

in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on the guidance provided in eitf issue no
