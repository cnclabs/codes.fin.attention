item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  install and service highly engineered equipment for use in the fabrication of semiconductor devices 
our products are focused on the wet chemical process steps in integrated circuit  or ic  manufacturing and include systems for wafer surface preparation and electrochemical deposition  or ecd  applications 
our surface preparation systems are designed for wet cleaning  stripping and etching processes  including photoresist and polymer removal and metal etching 
our ecd systems are used for copper and gold plating for the ic s internal wiring  or interconnects  solder and gold bumps for wafer level packaging applications  and other metals for various semiconductor and related applications 
the fabrication of semiconductor devices typically requires several hundred manufacturing steps  with the number of steps continuing to increase for advanced devices 
due to the breadth of our product portfolio and advanced technology capabilities  our solutions address over of these manufacturing steps 
there are several key trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry driving growth in demand for wafer surface preparation  ecd and other advanced semiconductor equipment smaller device features for lower cost and higher performance  new materials to fabricate more advanced semiconductor devices  increased use of mm wafers to reduce manufacturing costs  move to single wafer spray and immersion processing technologies for enhanced surface preparation  wafer level and other advanced packaging to enable smaller portable products  and emerging need for thinner wafers driven by the demand for smaller portable devices 
as the semiconductor manufacturing process increases in complexity and production parameters become more stringent  semiconductor manufacturers have increasingly relied upon providers of semiconductor equipment that features improved process control  smaller footprint and a lower cost of ownership of their manufacturing processes 
our solutions address critical applications within the semiconductor manufacturing process  and enable our customers to manufacture more advanced semiconductor devices that feature higher levels of performance 
key elements of our solution include technological leadership  a comprehensive product portfolio  including our raider platform and vertically integrated manufacturing and design capabilities 
key performance indicators our management focuses on revenues  gross margin  operating expenses and profitability in managing our business 
in addition to these financial measures found in our consolidated financial statements  we also use bookings  backlog  shipments and deferred revenue as key performance indicators 
bookings are firm orders for which we have received written customer authorization in the fiscal period 
backlog is the balance of undelivered orders at the end of a fiscal period 
in order to be included in bookings or backlog  an order must be scheduled to ship within the next months 
backlog and forecasted orders drive our production schedule 
shipments measure how well we have met our production plan and are viewed as a primary measure of factory output 
deferred revenue primarily represents tool shipments for which we are awaiting final customer acceptance 
a summary of key factors that impacted our financial performance during fiscal year includes our fiscal bookings were million and include over million in bookings for our raider platform 
fourth quarter fiscal bookings were over million 
shipments in fiscal were million including approximately million from raider shipments 
net income was million on net sales of million in fiscal compared with net income of million on net sales of million in fiscal our gross margin declined to of net sales  down from in fiscal fiscal bookings  shipments  net sales  gross margin and net income figures were all favorably impacted by million in license initiation fees for our seed layer enhancement patents 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million at september   a decrease of million from million at september   reflecting increased investment in inventory as we built inventory in response to customer demand 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal net sales year ended september  dollars in millions net sales by product line semiconductor equipment license fees by geographical distribution  percentage of net tool sales north america europe asia  including japan semiconductor equipment sales consist of revenues from sales of equipment tools  spare parts and service 
license fee revenue represents the license initiation fee for our seed layer enhancement patents 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal most product lines showed improvement over fiscal levels 
the primary driver of the increase in fiscal net sales was increasing sales of both single wafer surface preparation raiders and ecd raiders for copper interconnect and advanced packaging applications  which accounted for approximately of the million increase in net sales 
improved automated batch tool sales partially offset non recurring license initiation fees received in fiscal as a result of our seed layer enhancement patent litigation 
net sales increased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase in net sales reflected the improved state of the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries 
all product lines showed improvement in fiscal  particularly surface preparation applications and spare parts 
surface preparation net sales were favorably impacted by customer purchases of our new raider systems for single wafer cleaning applications as well as by customer purchases of our batch tools  both of which expanded our customers manufacturing capacity 
ecd net sales were primarily sales of our new raider systems for plating applications 
fiscal was also benefited by the receipt of million in license initiation fees for our seed layer enhancement patents 
fiscal net sales were adversely impacted by the downturn in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries 
customer purchases were primarily focused on newer technology products  especially single wafer tools  rather than on tools that increased manufacturing capacity 
product sales continued trends to mm equipment and single wafer platforms 
geographically  more than half of our fiscal net tool sales were derived from asia 
european sales accounted for approximately of net tool sales while north america contributed of our net tool sales 
this compares with approximately half of our fiscal net tool sales being derived from north america  which correlated with our first shipments of the raider platform 
europe and asia each accounted for approximately of our remaining tool sales in fiscal we anticipate continued strong sales in the asian market in fiscal gross profit year ended september  dollars in thousands gross profit    percentage of net sales gross profit increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal gross profit increased million or compared with fiscal gross profit of million 
we recorded a million inventory write down in fiscal due to obsolescence caused by the introduction of our new raider product 
gross profit increased in absolute dollars in fiscal and declined by percentage points from fiscal the fiscal gross margin was favorably impacted by the million license initiation fees discussed above 
exclusive of the license initiation fees  gross margin would have been essentially flat year over year  declining less than one percentage point 
the variability in gross margin year over year is primarily related to product mix as spare parts and service sales contributed a higher percentage to overall sales revenues in fiscal than in fiscal spare parts and service sales typically provide for a higher gross margin than do tool sales 
excess and obsolete inventory charges were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of the inventory write down in fiscal of the percentage point difference in gross margin in fiscal as compared with fiscal  the inventory write down in fiscal accounted for percentage points 
the receipt of million in license initiation fees for our seed layer enhancement patents also contributed over six points to the increase in margin in fiscal improved absorption of manufacturing costs also contributed to the improved margin in fiscal because our factory operated at higher levels of output 
fiscal gross margin was not significantly impacted by sales of tools containing parts that had been previously written down 
fiscal gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately percentage point due to the sale of tools that contained certain parts that had been previously written down 
revenues on those sales totaled million 
selling  general and administrative year ended september  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employment costs for sales  marketing  customer support and administrative personnel as well as travel  communications  professional fees and expenses related to sales and service offices at our global locations 
sg a expenses increased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal after decreasing million in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses declined to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal employment costs increased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as we restored wages from previously imposed pay reductions  increased staff to support expanded business activity and accrued for profit sharing bonuses 
commission expense  primarily related to increased sales activity in asia  increased more than million in the year over year comparison 
legal expenses declined approximately million as plaintiff litigation related to our seed layer enhancement patents concluded in early fiscal increased professional fees primarily related to increased audit and sarbanes oxley section compliance offset the reduction in legal costs 
sarbanes oxley and audit compliance fees were in excess of million  more than triple our fiscal costs 
travel and other expenses increased related to the overall increase in business opportunity and activity 
legal expenses decreased more than in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our efforts to bring our plaintiff litigation to conclusion and to manage our legal costs 
costs related to worldwide marketing and customer support efforts increased by approximately as a result of increased business opportunity and activity 
professional fees increased by over primarily as a result of additional accounting and legal support expense related to the current financial regulatory environment 
commission expense declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflecting the change in our geographic sales mix from asia to north america 
generally  commission expense is directly variable with sales and is also dependent on the geographic region of the sale as commission rates vary from region to region 
research and development year ended september  dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of net sales research and development r d expense consists of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees and other costs associated with our product development efforts 
r d expense increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal prototype expense increased almost million in fiscal as we worked on a number of projects 
surface preparation r d projects included front end of line feol cleaning applications  immersion processes  single wafer megasonic cleans  single wafer ozone cleans and hydrofluoric vapor cleans 
ecd r d focused on the development of a lead free solder application and hardware  membrane technology to control the cost of chemicals used in plating  work on deep via plating to be used in d chipstacking applications and seed layer enhancement 
batch process r d projects included wafer thinning processes and automated foup front opening unified pod cleaning processes and hardware 
labor expense increased approximately million as a result of the reversal of a wage reduction in effect in fiscal  staffing level increases and profit sharing accruals 
r d depreciation expense increased almost million as we replaced older technology tools in our demonstration laboratories with raider platform tools 
r d depreciation expense declined in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as assets placed in service earlier reached the end of their estimated useful lives 
prototype expense also declined in fiscal because our focus was meeting new customer requirements for the raider platform whereas in the prior year we were engaged in the development of this new platform 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in other operating expenses as a result of a general increase in business activity 
in fiscal  our r d projects focused on development of our single wafer megasonic processing chamber to improve particle removal for the critical cleaning market  development of the environmentally friendly hydrozone cleaning process for critical layers in the transistor formation step of ic fabrication and development of the next generation capsule ii processing chamber for post etch cleaning  wafer backside and bevel cleaning 
for our plating technology  we also developed a membrane chamber that reduces chemical consumption  which is critical for cost sensitive chip manufacturing and wafer level packaging applications 
our research and development expense has fluctuated from period to period in the past 
we expect such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and fluctuations in the level of net sales in a given period 
we expect to continue to fund research and development expenditures with a multi year perspective and are committed to technology leadership in our sector of the semiconductor equipment industry 
other income expense year ended september  in thousands interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss other  total other income expense  net other income expense increased to a net income of million in fiscal in october  we received a seed layer enhancement litigation settlement payment of million from novellus systems  inc which accounts for most of the year over year increase 
net other income expense declined to a net expense of  in fiscal from net income of  in fiscal interest income declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal to  in fiscal  reflecting reduced cash investments 
we reported a minimal foreign exchange loss in fiscal in fiscal  we reported foreign exchange losses because of fluctuations in the yen  euro and the british pound 
in fiscal  we reported foreign exchange losses because of fluctuations in the yen and the euro 
other income in fiscal included the proceeds we received from a settlement in connection with a patent claim that we pursued against a german manufacturer of semiconductor equipment 
income taxes year ended september  in thousands income tax provision benefit    our estimated effective tax rate increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we recognized a research and experimentation credit of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal legislation to extend the credit was signed into law after september   therefore we were unable to recognize the credit in fiscal  when it was generated 
this resulted in a recorded tax rate of for fiscal the primary difference in the recorded tax rate for fiscal is the effect of research and development credits related to increasing research and development activity 
the difference in the effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the effect of research and development credits and our foreign income exclusion  which increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal because we were profitable in fiscal backlog and deferred revenue september  dollars in millions backlog percentage change in backlog from prior year to date period end deferred revenue percentage change in deferred revenue from prior year to date period end approximately of our current backlog is for tools on the raider platform 
deferred revenue decreased million at september  as compared with september  primarily because of increased shipments of raiders into existing customer environments where raiders have been previously installed or accepted  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
current deferrals include all or a part of raiders at september  as compared with raiders at september   however  the fiscal year figures include a higher percentage of raiders that represented new tools shipped into new customer environments  requiring full deferral of revenue on those tools 
we include in backlog those customer orders for which we have written customer authorization and for which shipment is scheduled within the next months 
orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no cancellation fees 
as the result of systems ordered and shipped in the same quarter  possible changes in customer delivery dates  cancellations and shipment delays and acceptances of shipped equipment carried in deferred revenue  the backlog at any particular date and the bookings for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
in particular  during periods of downturns in the semiconductor industry we have experienced cancellations and significant shipment delays 
deferred profit included in our current liabilities is derived from deferred revenue  which primarily relates to equipment shipped to customers that has not been accepted by the customer  less the deferred cost of sales  including warranty and installation  and commission expenses 
deferred revenue is not included in orders backlog 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
in fiscal  cash used by operations was million 
the primary use of cash was to support inventory growth of million 
work in process and finished goods inventories contained more than million in tools that were substantially complete either awaiting shipment or shipped during the fourth quarter under evaluation agreements 
net of the million  inventories  primarily work in process and raw materials  have grown to support the shipment volumes in fiscal and expected fiscal shipments 
deferred profit decreased by million from year end fiscal levels because acceptances of raider and other high value tools have exceeded deferrals of revenue  and associated cost deferrals in fiscal the primary source of cash during the period was the collection of trade receivables in the normal course of business 
trade receivables declined by million from september  we received a million litigation settlement and a million income tax refund in fiscal other sources of cash in fiscal included net income of million and changes in non cash components of net income  primarily depreciation  amortization and deferred income taxes 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities were the receipt of the million in license initiation fees included in income from operations and the receipt of over million in income tax refunds 
inventory increased million and accounts payable increased million as a result of our plan to reduce manufacturing cycle times and provide faster deliveries to our customers by stocking components that will help shorten our lead times 
trade receivables increased due to higher shipment levels in fiscal the increase in deferred profit was the result of revenue and expenses deferred on our new raider products pending final customer acceptance 
in fiscal  our deferred profit pool was being relieved as we received customer acceptances on new tools deferred in prior periods 
in fiscal  we shipped new tools to new customers which  under our revenue recognition policy guided by sab  requires that revenue and the associated expenses be deferred  until customer acceptance is received 
in fiscal  we used cash from operations of million 
the net loss in fiscal  adjusted for non cash benefits  most notably the inventory write down of million  depreciation and amortization and decreases in tax assets  was the primary factor in the use of cash from operating activities in fiscal changes in working capital accounts  notably decreases in trade receivables  provided million in cash 
this was offset by an increase in income tax refund receivable of million related to the net operating loss  and reductions in deferred profit of million  the result of the receipt of customer acceptances on new tools deferred in prior periods that were not offset by new tool deferrals 
investing activities 
investing activities in fiscal included million in purchases of factory equipment and other property and net cash proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities 
we invested an additional million in our development and demonstration laboratories primarily for tools on our raider platform in fiscal by transferring finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment 
we also continued to invest in intellectual property rights which used cash of million 
in fiscal  investing activities included million in purchases of factory equipment and other property and net cash used for the purchase of marketable securities of million 
we invested an additional million in our development and demonstration laboratories in fiscal by transferring finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment 
we also invested million in intangible assets  primarily in our patent portfolio 
we used million to acquire property  plant and equipment  primarily laboratory equipment in fiscal consistent with our focus on product and process development  we further invested in our development and demonstration laboratories with a transfer of million in finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment in fiscal cash invested in intangible assets  primarily intellectual property rights  was approximately million in fiscal financing activities 
financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of cash received from stock option exercises of  and borrowings under long term debt of million for a new facility currently being constructed in austria 
we expect long term debt for the facility to increase to approximately million with a fixed interest rate of for five years 
cash proceeds were offset by long term debt repayments of  during fiscal financing activities consisted primarily of cash received from stock option exercises of million offset by long term debt repayments of  during fiscal cash used in financing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of net repayments on long term borrowings of  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of  off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to the types of financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following commitments as of september   incurred in the normal course of business  have been included in the consolidated financial statements with the exception of purchase order commitments and operating lease obligations  which are properly excluded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
they are disclosed in the following table in order to provide a consolidated picture of our financial position and liquidity 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt   operating leases  purchase order commitments   total commitments     we have agreements with limited liability companies wholly owned by mr 
raymon f 
thompson  our chairman and chief executive officer  to lease aircraft and an aircraft hangar 
under these agreements  rent expense was approximately   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the current rental rate is approximately  per month for both the aircraft and the hangar  the lease terms are month to month and therefore are not included in the above table 
in fiscal  we incurred  of leasehold improvements to leased aircraft 
the improvements are being amortized over a three year period  which represents the estimated useful life 
in december  we sold a condominium located in kalispell  montana to larry e 
murphy  our president and chief operating officer  for  in cash 
the condominium had previously been used to provide short term housing to employees who were not located in the kalispell area 
the terms were negotiated with mr 
murphy based on the estimated current market value of the condominium 
as of september   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million in marketable securities and incoming cash generated from operations 
as a result of growing our business  we experienced negative cash flows from operating activities of million for the year ended september  we experienced negative cash flows from operating activities of million for the year ended september  despite the negative cash flows from operating activities  we have been able to fulfill our working capital and capital expenditure needs due to available cash resources and maintaining adequate debt financing arrangements 
we expect existing debt financing arrangements and cash flows generated from operating activities to be sufficient to fund operations at the current and projected levels in the future 
we have a million credit agreement with our bank 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we negotiated an amendment to the agreement increasing our revolving credit facility from million to million 
we are currently in negotiations with the bank for a long term loan to finance the acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities in the kalispell area 
we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  along with funds expected to be generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility to meet operating expenses and planned capital expenditures through fiscal and into the foreseeable future 
we estimate capital expenditures will be between million and million during the next months 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement  which registers the offer and sale of up to an aggregate million of our securities 
if additional financial resources are required in the future  we expect either to issue securities from the shelf registration statement or to issue other financial instruments  whichever management deems advisable 
of course  there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to issue additional common stock or other financial instruments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  warranty obligations  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we recognize revenue under the guidance for staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
under this method  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our product sales generally contain substantive customer acceptance provisions 
sales of new products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
likewise  sales of existing products to new customer environments are not recognized until customer acceptance 
if multiple elements exist  sales of existing products into existing customer environments are treated as such in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount that was due or payable upon title transfer 
the revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and or services are delivered or performed 
revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or ratably over the life of the related service contract 
spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
unearned revenue from service contract agreements is included in customer advances in the current liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the timing of certain expenses  such as cost of sales  including installation and warranty  and commission expenses coincides with the recognition of the related revenues 
we follow specific guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments such as the definition of a new customer environment and new acceptance criteria or if installation is perfunctory may be required in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
accordingly  we write down the carrying value of inventories for estimated obsolescence and future marketability 
on a quarterly basis  we compare historical and projected sales and usage of raw materials and parts and our assumptions about future use of raw materials  parts and finished goods with our forecast  market demand and industry conditions to determine potential obsolescence or whether the inventory on hand represents excess quantities 
as a result of our analysis  we record reserves impacting cost of sales  if appropriate 
these reserves are subject to management judgment and if actual future use  demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory valuation write downs may be required 
warranty obligations 
we provide for the estimated cost of equipment warranties when the related revenue is recognized 
we track individual warranties on a tool by tool basis and develop estimated rates by equipment class based on this history 
the rates are used to estimate the warranty accrual for a given specific piece of equipment 
these rates are revised periodically to reflect current cost trends due to the current life cycle of that product class 
the warranty accrual is reduced by actual costs of providing the warranty or if a balance is remaining at the end of the warranty period  then that amount is also written off 
warranty accrual expense impacts primarily cost of sales 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record expense as a component of selling  general and administrative within the consolidated statements of operations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  due to the cyclicality of the industries we serve or for other reasons  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and expense may be required 
likewise  if we are successfully able to collect on an amount presumed to be uncollectible  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related expense may be reduced 
in general  it takes longer to collect payment in the capital equipment industry than in certain other industries 
days sales outstanding dso of peer companies in our industry ranges between approximately and days 
impairment of investments in marketable securities 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
any investment impairment would be recorded in the consolidated financial statements as other expense 
deferred tax assets 
we make estimates to determine the amount of our deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  a decrease in the deferred tax asset would negatively impact our results of operations  particularly the income tax provision  in the period such determination was made 
litigation we are involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of these matters  it is the opinion of management  based upon the information available at this time  that the currently expected outcome of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r generally requires companies to recognize in the statement of income the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued sab which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the application of sfas no 
r 
among other things  sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
on april   the sec issued the final rule amendment to rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which revised the effective date of sfas no 
r to the beginning of our next fiscal year that begins after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
r in our first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
r including the assessment of allowable option valuation methodologies and methods of transition 
were we to continue to value options using the black scholes option pricing model  the impact of the adoption of this standard would result in approximately  of pretax stock compensation expense per quarter or million per year 
in november  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
in our first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
further requires a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets to be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal we will only be impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
if we implement changes in accounting principles that are addressed by the standard or correct accounting errors in future periods 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement and that the fair value of the liability should be recognized when incurred 
the provisions of this interpretation are effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  accordingly  we will adopt fin by the end of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rate and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of september   we had approximately million in long term debt and no short term debt 
our long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate 
as a result  changes in the fixed rate interest market would change the estimated fair value of the fixed rate long term debt 
however  we believe that a change in the long term interest rate would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
all of our international operations are subject to inherent risks in conducting business abroad  including fluctuation in the relative value of currencies 
we manage this risk and attempt to reduce such exposure through an economic hedge using short term forward exchange contracts 
at september   we held forward contracts to sell japanese yen with a total face value of million and a total market value of million and a total unrealized gain of approximately  the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts is offset to the extent of receivables denominated in japanese yen 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on hedged transactions involving japanese yen forward exchange contracts and the underlying transactions would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
