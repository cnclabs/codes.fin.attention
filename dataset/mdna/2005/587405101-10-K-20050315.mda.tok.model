executive overview mercantile bankshares corporation bankshares is a regional multibank holding company headquartered in baltimore  maryland 
at december   bankshares had billion in assets  billion in loans and billion in deposits 
the two principal lines of business are banking and investment wealth management iwm  delivered through the lead bank mercantile safe deposit and trust company msd t and affiliated banks 
see segment reporting below for more information 
bankshares recorded its th consecutive year of increased net income in net income for bankshares was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year diluted net income per common share for increased by to compared with for the most noteworthy factors affecting earnings were the successful integration of f m bancorp farmers  the consolidation of bank affiliates into four the affiliate bank rationalization  improvement in the net interest margin  growth in loans  improving credit quality and improved profit contribution from the iwm division 
on august   bankshares completed its acquisition of farmers  a bank holding company headquartered in frederick  maryland 
on the date of purchase  farmers had total loans of billion  total investment securities of million  total earning assets of billion and total deposits of billion 
there were million shares issued in connection with the acquisition  which was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in total consideration paid of million including the cash component 
farmers is the second largest affiliate bank in the organization behind only msd t in total assets 
the results of operations and balances for farmers are included in the consolidated financial statements from the merger date forward 
bankshares recorded million of goodwill  million of core deposit intangible  million of client relationship intangibles and million in other identified intangible assets 
in the third quarter of  bankshares consolidated affiliate banks into four banks 
the consolidated banks shared common markets 
the consolidation of these banks allows the surviving banks to serve their local customers with greater size  scale and expertise 
this initiative was not undertaken to reduce operating costs  although some savings will arise out of the consolidation 
it was to enable these banks to streamline operating processes  controls and compliance efforts  recruit seasoned professionals to these markets  and provide a greater breadth of services at the local level 
bankshares is highly committed to the affiliate bank model  whereby local boards of directors provide strong oversight  and bank presidents maintain strong relationships within the community 
as with any strategic initiative there are costs involved 
in  banking incurred approximately million in restructuring charges related to the consolidations 
a majority of these costs were in severance charges and other personnel costs of approximately million and million in legal and consulting fees 
management expects to achieve cost savings of not less than million in in response to the improving economy  the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board began increasing short term interest rates 
after reducing short term rates by basis points in and basis points in  the federal reserve board increased short term rates basis points in by year end  the benchmark targeted overnight federal funds rate had risen from to 
although the net interest margin improved only basis points to for from for  this compares very favorably with the basis point decline experienced during the net interest margin for was 
most economists are forecasting that the federal reserve board will continue to raise short term rates during if these forecasts are correct  bankshares should benefit from such action 
see analysis of interest rate and interest differentials below and the discussions of net interest income and interest rate risk below 
at december   loans outstanding were billion  an increase of over the billion outstanding at december  excluding initial balances acquired in acquisitions  this was the best year end loan growth bankshares has reported since year end december  much of the lending growth has been driven by the strong real estate markets in both commercial and residential properties 
an improving economy also produced positive growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio 
credit quality measures improved on both an absolute and relative basis 
nonperforming loans declined from million a year ago to million at december  this is the lowest level reported at year end since december  nonperforming loans as a percent of year end loans were 
at december  this is the lowest level at year end in more than years 
reflecting these improvements  the provision for loan losses declined by million to million for the year ended december  the iwm division includes the results from boyd watterson asset management  llc boyd watterson  an investment management firm  and peremel company  inc peremel  a directed and discount brokerage company  acquired on march  and april   respectively 
in the aggregate  these companies were purchased for approximately million in cash 
the boyd watterson acquisition has a potential additional contingent payment of up to million based upon performance  among other factors 
the contingent payment will be recorded as goodwill  assuming specific metrics are met  and becomes payable three years from the acquisition date 
bankshares recorded approximately million of identified intangibles  mostly client relationships  as a result of these acquisitions 
these intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over a range of three to eight years 
goodwill recorded on these transactions totaled approximately million at december  a combination of net new business and improving equity markets produced a increase in iwm noninterest income 
see segment reporting below for additional information 
at the same time  growth in direct noninterest expense was held to 
accordingly  the contribution to net income more than doubled to million in  from million in the year proved to be another year of relatively solid performance  as indicated by the standard industry measures of return on average assets roa and return on average shareholders equity roe 
the roa was  unchanged from primarily due to the equity issued in the farmers acquisition  bankshares roe decreased to from in average assets increased by  or billion  average deposits increased by  or billion  and average loans increased by  or billion  for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
the respective increases in the average balances are largely attributable to the inclusion of farmers for a full year 
bankshares also reports cash operating earnings  defined as gaap generally accepted accounting principles earnings excluding the amortization of intangible assets associated with purchase accounting for business combinations  securities gains and losses  and other significant gains  losses or expenses such as those associated with integrating acquired entities operations into bankshares unrelated to bankshares core operations 
cash operating earnings totaled million for  an increase of over million for diluted cash operating earnings per share for were compared with for a reconciliation of gaap basis net income to cash operating earnings can be found below under non gaap reconciliation 
average shareholders equity to average assets was at for  an increase from for in the second quarter of  million shares at a cost of million were repurchased under bankshares buyback plan 
the buyback was accomplished by entering into a privately negotiated agreement for the accelerated repurchase of these shares 
in   shares were repurchased in the open market 
at december   bankshares had remaining authorization to repurchase up to  shares 
management believes that reporting several key measures based on tangible assets total assets less intangible assets and tangible equity total equity less intangible assets is important  as this more closely approximates the basis for measuring the adequacy of capital for regulatory purposes 
for the year  return on average tangible assets was compared with for the ratio of average tangible equity to average tangible assets for was compared with for the decline in average tangible equity to average tangible assets was largely attributable to the use of million of cash or of the consideration paid to acquire farmers 
a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures is below 
see non gaap reconciliation 
the remaining sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations will provide a more detailed explanation of the important trends and material changes in components of our financial statements 
the discussion suggests that sustaining future earnings growth comparable to our experience in past years will require  among other things  efficient generation of loan growth in a competitive market  while maintaining an adequate spread between yields on earning assets and the cost of funds 
our degree of success in meeting these goals depends on unpredictable factors such as possible changes in prevailing interest rates  the mix of deposits  credit quality and general economic conditions

critical accounting policies and related estimates set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that management believes are the most critical to understanding bankshares consolidated financial statements  financial condition and results of operations  and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding bankshares other accounting policies is included in note no 
of the financial statements 
investment securities investment securities classified as held to maturity are acquired with the intent and ability to hold until maturity and are carried at cost 
investment securities classified as available for sale are acquired to be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates and or prepayment risk or for liquidity management purposes 
these securities are carried at fair value 
securities may become impaired on an other than temporary basis  which involves a degree of judgment 
therefore  an assessment is made at the end of each quarter to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security is impaired on an other than temporary basis 
an other than temporary impairment may develop if  based on all available evidence  the carrying amount of the investment is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
factors considered in making this assessment include among others  the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value  external credit ratings and recent downgrades  market price fluctuations due to factors other than interest rates  and the probability of collection of contractual cash flows 
securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other than temporary are written down to fair value  and the adjustment is recorded as a realized loss 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
bankshares allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based on evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical quantitative information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as qualitative information about the prevailing economic and business environment among other things 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific allocations to impaired loans  general allocations to pools of loans not deemed impaired and an unallocated amount 
the specific allowance allocation is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio 
each loan with an outstanding balance in excess of a specified threshold that is either on nonaccrual status or on the watchlist is evaluated 
the watchlist represents loans identified and closely followed by management 
they possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
the identified loans are evaluated for potential loss in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
by analyzing current collateral values or present value of cash flows  as well as the capacity of the guarantor  as applicable 
the general allowance calculation begins with segmentation of the remaining unimpaired portfolio according to loan types 
historical loss factors are maintained for each loan type  providing the starting point of the analysis 
historical loss factors are applied to all non watchlist loans 
management is currently utilizing the past five year loss history specific to each major segment to perform the allocation 
historical loss factors are adjusted to reflect the point in time that management initially identified a potential impairment loss in such risk rated loans as opposed to when such loss is actually taken as a charge off against the allowance 
this adjustment is necessary  as bankshares practice has generally been to work with its borrowers through their economic difficulties and record a charge off when all recovery efforts have been exhausted 
accordingly  historical losses may tend to lag the national and regional economic cycles 
bankshares also has developed data on probability of default and loss given default  which have been incorporated for the higher risk rated credits  which include watchlist loans that are not currently impaired 
those loss factors are then applied to all loans within the same risk rating 
qualitative factors that may cause credit losses to deviate from average historical experience are then developed 
these include but are not limited to changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  changes in the volume of watchlist loans and nonaccruals  concentrations in a specific industry or geographic location  administrative risk concerns that include changes in the loan review and loan grading system  changes in lending policies and procedures which include underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery practices  changes in management or the staff of any previously mentioned areas  and current economic conditions and indicators 
both internal and external peer data are utilized as applicable to establish these factors 
management s judgment and experience are key to this process 
these factors are revised to address current conditions and trends in the portfolio 
the allowance amount not allocated represents the differential between the combined specific and general allocations and the actual allowance 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the imprecision inherent in estimating and measuring loss when allocating the allowance to individual or pools of loans 
it also takes into consideration the allowance level deemed appropriate by each affiliate based on its local knowledge and feedback from bank regulators and their view from the standpoint of safety and soundness  among other factors 
for a full discussion of bankshares methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses below and note no 
of the financial statements 
loans on nonaccrual status or deemed to be impaired a loan asset will be classified and placed into nonaccrual status when the principal or interest payments on any loan eg  commercial  mortgage and construction loans are past due days or more at the end of a calendar quarter and or the payment in full of principal or interest is not expected 
any accrued but uncollected interest is reversed at that time 
consumer installment loans are charged off when they become days past due 
additionally  a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than days  if in management s judgment  the loan or portions thereof are deemed uncollectible 
bankshares ceases to accrue interest income on such loans 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is recorded only once principal recovery is reasonably assured 
generally a loan may be restored to accruing status when all past due principal  interest and late charges have been paid and the bank expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest 
a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that bankshares will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans do not include large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment eg  residential mortgages and consumer installment loans 
the impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the repayment is expected to be provided predominantly by the underlying collateral 
a majority of bankshares impaired loans are measured by reference to the fair value of the collateral 
income taxes bankshares recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryovers and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment  based on available evidence  that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that bankshares may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  then bankshares would be required to record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax asset 
in such an event  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
although management has determined that a valuation allowance is not currently required  no assurance can be given that one will not be required in the future 
for more information regarding bankshares accounting for income taxes  see note no 
of the financial statements 
valuation of goodwill intangible assets and analysis for impairment bankshares has increased its market share  in part  through the acquisition of entire financial institutions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  as well as from the purchase of other financial institutions branches not the entire institution 
bankshares is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which involves an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
see note no 
of the financial statements for further information on the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
ii 
analysis of operating results for to segment reporting bankshares has historically identified three distinct business segments for which financial information is segregated for use in assessing performance and allocating resources when reporting to the board of directors 
this segmentation is consistent with the reporting structure established at the time bankshares was formed 
at that time the organization consisted of a lead bank  msd t  with two business segments banking and investment wealth management iwm  and a community bank segment  which has been built through acquisitions and continued operation of independent charters 
with the farmers acquisition in and the consolidation of affiliate banks into four banks in  the distinction between banking segments has become less apparent 
increased lending authority at the banks has resulted in additional loan growth within their market areas and reduced referral and overline business to msd t 
as a result of the convergence of the two banking segments  bankshares currently reports these segments collectively as banking 
the banking segment consists of the group of affiliate banks 
mortgage banking activities are not viewed as a separate business line due to the insignificant impact on the core business of bankshares and  accordingly  are included in the banking segment 
a schedule disclosing the details of these operating segments can be found in note no 
of the financial statements 
segment financial information is subjective and  unlike financial accounting  is not necessarily based on gaap 
as a result  financial information of the reporting segments is not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by others and may not be comparable with bankshares consolidated results 
certain expense amounts  such as operations overhead  have been reclassified from internal financial reporting in order to provide for proper allocation of costs in the reported data 
banking the banking segment includes the retail  small business  commercial and mortgage banking lines of business 
banking products include retail banking checking  savings and money market accounts  time deposits and iras  insurance  equity lines and loans  lines of credit  and equipment and transportation auto  recreational vehicle and marine loans 
small business banking deposit and credit products and services to businesses with annual revenues up to million or credit needs up to thousand  including receivables and inventory financing  equipment leases  and real estate financing 
commercial banking commercial deposit  lending and commercial real estate solutions to businesses typically with annual revenues between million and million  and including commercial loans and lines of credit  letters of credit  asset based lending  commercial real estate  construction loans and capital market products 
mortgage banking residential mortgage loan origination  construction and servicing 
in the third quarter of  bankshares consolidated affiliate banks into four banks 
the consolidated banks shared common markets 
the consolidation of these banks allows the surviving banks to serve their local customers with greater size  scale and expertise 
this initiative was not undertaken to reduce operating costs  although some savings will arise out of the consolidation 
it was to enable these banks to streamline operating processes  controls and compliance efforts  recruit seasoned professionals to these markets  and provide a greater breadth of services at the local level 
bankshares is highly committed to the affiliate bank model  whereby local boards of directors provide strong oversight  and bank presidents maintain strong relationships within the community 
as with any strategic initiative there are costs involved 
in  banking incurred approximately million in restructuring charges related to the consolidations 
a majority of these costs were in severance charges and other personnel costs of approximately million and million in legal and consulting fees 
management expects to achieve cost savings of not less than million in dollars in thousands banking iwm other total net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expenses adjustments income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss average loans average earning assets average assets average deposits average equity dollars in thousands banking iwm other total net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expenses adjustments income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss average loans average earning assets average assets average deposits average equity the addition of farmers during had a significant impact on nearly every line of the consolidated balance sheet and statement of consolidated income as well as the performance of the banking segment  as set forth below 
net income for banking for increased to million  from million for net interest income for banking increased to million for from million for the growth in net interest income in reflected a increase in average earning assets  which more than offset a basis point decline in the net interest margin from in to in contributing to the net interest margin decline was the capital restructuring of the banks during the third quarter of last year 
subordinated debt totaling million  issued by bankshares in april  and used in part to fund the cash portion of the farmers acquisition  was invested in a like amount of subordinated debt issued by the banks 
excess equity capital was paid to bankshares in the form of a special cash dividend 
as a reflection of the overall improvement in the banking credit quality trends  banking recorded a decrease of million in the provision for loan losses for banking recorded a provision for loan losses of million in compared with million in the allowance as a percent of loans was at year end compared with at year end average assets for banking increased to billion in average investments and loans increased and  respectively  while other assets accounted for the balance of the increase in average assets

noninterest income increased by million  with deposit service charges increasing by million  insurance fees increasing by million and electronic banking fees increasing by million  accounting for the largest gains 
these gains were partially offset by a decrease of million in net gains on investment securities sold 
noninterest expenses increased by million from more than of this increase is related to salaries and benefits  which grew by million 
severance costs related to the affiliate bank consolidations were approximately million 
occupancy expense increased by million  and amortization of intangible assets increased by million  while furniture and equipment expenses decreased by million

on november   bankshares consolidated its brokerage activities by merging mercantile securities  inc  into peremel 
the resulting entity is called mercantile brokerage services  inc  a general securities broker dealer that offers full service  discount and online brokerage services 
continued progress was made in growing the iwm business and enhancing client services 
resources related to distribution were added within iwm as well as the affiliate banks  including the addition of a small team of financial advisors 
improvements were made in client reporting 
effective january   iwm converted its trust accounting platform to sungard wealth management systems 
net income in iwm increased to million in  from million in pretax profit margins  prior to corporate overhead allocations  were and for and  respectively 
for more information on corporate overhead see other in segment reporting below 
at december   assets under administration by iwm were billion  an increase of billion from the prior year 
bankshares had investment management responsibility for billion  up billion from the prior year 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue increases were achieved in the three principal client segments private wealth  institutional and brokerage 
growth in iwm revenues was due principally to stronger markets during than  new business development efforts and the inclusion of a full year s results from boyd watterson and peremel  which were acquired on march  and april   respectively 
together  these acquisitions accounted for million of the increase in revenues 
the improved performance in equity markets that began in the second quarter of had a positive impact on iwm revenues throughout slightly more than of iwm s managed assets is invested in equities  including real estate 
approximately one third is invested in fixed income securities and just above is invested in short term money market investments 
between december  and december   all major equity indices rose 
the s p index was up  the dow jones industrial average was up and the nasdaq was up 
gross new assets from new business development efforts exceeded million  up approximately from all client segments contributed to this growth  with institutional real estate and brokerage showing the highest growth rates 
revenues related to gross new assets were partially offset by higher levels of terminating accounts in the private wealth management segment 
also contributing to revenue growth during were increases in and the performance of the three hedge funds of funds hedge funds 
additional revenue growth will depend on continued new sales and increased distribution  equity and bond market conditions and further acquisitions  if any 
expenses increased to million in increases in legal and professional service expenses were offset largely by decreases in personnel related and technology expenses 
also contributing to the increase was the inclusion of a full year s results for boyd watterson and peremel 
excluding the impact of the acquisitions  expenses fell  or million 
expenses for included million of severance and million paid to terminate a technology equipment lease 
during the first quarter of  bankshares entered into a seven year service contract with sungard wealth management services to provide a new core accounting system and back office operations beginning in january year to date  iwm has incurred approximately million in restructuring charges related to the conversion to sungard s addvantage trust accounting system 
a majority of these costs were severance charges of approximately million 
conversion costs of approximately million that were incurred in are being amortized over the life of the contract 
other the components in the other column consist of amounts for the nonbanking affiliates  unallocated corporate expenses and intercompany eliminations 
net interest income increased million due to a full year of intercompany income related to the subordinated debt referred to in the banking section 
noninterest income increased million related to income from private equity investments 
the adjustments line  which represents corporate allocations from the lead bank msd t  increased million in over this increase is due mostly to allocations related to sarbanes oxley compliance and increased staffing in corporate support functions

net interest income net interest income represents the largest source of bankshares revenue 
changes in both the level of interest rates and the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities affect it 
interest rate risk represents one of the more significant risks facing financial institutions like bankshares 
see additional discussion under the caption interest rate risk below 
it is measured in terms of the effect changes in market interest rates have on net interest income 
bankshares is asset sensitive  with assets repricing more quickly than liabilities in response to changes in interest rates 
in a falling rate environment  bankshares net interest margin net interest income expressed as a percent of average earning assets compresses  causing the growth in net interest income to slow 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was million for this represents an increase of  or million  over the prior year s million 
in  fully tax equivalent net interest income increased by million  or  over investments in hedge funds and other nonmarketable investments were reclassified from securities available for sale into nonmarketable investment securities  which are included as other assets 
the impact on the net interest margin of this reclassification was a reduction in the net interest margin of and basis points  in and  respectively 
this reclassification did not have an impact on the net interest margin 
as previously noted  net interest income is affected by changes in the volume of earning assets and the net interest margin earned thereon 
the rate volume analysis table below presents further details supporting this discussion 
average earning assets increased by billion  or  in  due primarily to a full year s results from the farmers acquisition 
average total loans grew billion  or  during as with earning assets  this growth is due primarily to a full year related to the farmers acquisition 
organic loan growth was fairly consistent throughout the year 
average securities  the other major component of earning assets  increased by million  or  in compared with an increase of million  or  in the prior year 
the increase in was largely attributable to the farmers acquisition 
the slowing growth of the investment portfolio in is attributable to liquidity needed to fund improved loan growth 
see iii 
analysis of financial condition below for a more in depth discussion of balance sheet trends 
the overall growth in average earning assets added million to net interest income in also contributing to the increase in net interest income was a basis point increase in the net interest margin from in to in this represented the first increase in the net interest margin in three years 
the net interest spread also increased by basis points to in from in the net interest spread is the difference between the yield earned on total earning assets and the rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities 
the improvement in the net interest spread is reflected in the volume variance in the rate volume analysis  as it resulted primarily from a change in the mix of earning assets from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans 
the individual loan and security rates earned in were consistently lower than and are reflected as the rate variance in the rate volume analysis 
the benefit from the improved net interest spread was partially offset by a decline in the benefit bankshares derives from its noninterest bearing sources of funding 
such benefit declined by basis points in and basis points in  due to historically low interest rates in those periods 
approximately of the funding of average earning assets is derived from noninterest bearing sources 
in response to the improving economy  the federal reserve board began increasing short term interest rates in after reducing short term rates by basis points in and basis points in  the federal reserve board increased short term rates by basis points in looking forward to  management anticipates a moderate increase in short term interest rates 
as to intermediate and long term interest rates  a clear direction can not be discerned based on recent trends 
these rates remain at or near recent lows and create a downward movement in the net interest margin as fixed rate loans and investments mature and are replaced by loans and investments at lower current yields 
however  with some signs of an improving economy beginning to emerge  management anticipates the net interest margin will remain stable  as improving loan growth should result in earning assets more heavily weighted toward higher yielding loans compared with investment securities and as rising rates increase the benefit of noninterest bearing funds

changes attributable to mix rate and volume are included in the volume variance 
interest income fully tax equivalent interest income amounted to million in  an increase of million  or  from million in this compares favorably with the million  or  increase in from the increase in was due to growth in average loans and securities that contributed million in additional interest income 
this increase was offset by a decline in market interest rates  resulting in a million reduction in interest income from the lower yield on earning assets 
during  the million reduction in interest income from lower earning asset yields was offset by million in additional interest income generated by the growth in earning assets primarily due to the acquisition of farmers 
at year end  the prime rate was  compared with and at year end and  respectively 
the average prime rate was for  compared with for  an increase of basis points 
the yield on average total loans in was  a basis point decrease from in the commercial and construction loan portfolios are the most sensitive to changes in short term interest rates 
however  the construction portfolio was the only category to report increased average yield compared with last year 
the residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios are affected mostly by intermediate and long term rates and do not move with prime rate 
the yields on the consumer loan portfolio and the residential real estate portfolios decreased by and basis points  respectively 
the yield on investment securities  in  declined basis points from in the yield on the portfolio decreased basis points in from in bankshares has been changing the mix of the portfolio to offset the negative impact on interest income from reinvesting at lower yields 
during bankshares followed a strategy begun in to shift from us treasury to higher yielding us agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
this has resulted in a mix of  and of treasury  agency and mortgage backed securities  respectively  in the other of the investment securities was comprised of municipals and other investments at year end 
interest expense total interest expense in was million  a decrease of million from million in the decrease in interest expense for was attributable to a decrease in the rate paid on total interest bearing funds of basis points  which was partially offset by a growth in average balances 
total interest expense in was million less than the million reported in with the combination of interest rates at record low levels and the federal reserve board s increase in short term rates in the econd half of  management anticipates that rates paid on managed rate deposits savings  checking plus interest and money market accounts will increase 
see management s discussion under interest rate risk below for further information regarding bankshares exposure to changes in interest rates 
the rate paid on average total interest bearing deposits was in  a decline of basis points from for the prior year

certificates of deposit of  and over declined basis points  while the rate paid on other time deposits declined basis points in the most interest rate sensitive source of funds is short term borrowings 
this category is comprised of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and commercial paper 
the duration of these funds is very short  with most repricing daily 
reflecting the rate environment  the rate paid on short term borrowings increased basis points to in  after having decreased by basis points in to 
the rate paid on long term debt declined basis points in  following a decline of basis points in the prior year 
the decline is related primarily to the million of year debt issued by msd t in the fourth quarter of these notes  which were issued at a fixed rate of  were converted to a floating rate through an interest rate swap

iwm revenue represented the largest source of noninterest income at 
revenues increased to million in growth in iwm was due principally to stronger equity markets on average during compared with  new business development efforts and the inclusion of boyd watterson and peremel  which were acquired on march  and april   respectively 
additional growth will depend on continued new sales and increased distribution  equity and bond market conditions and further acquisitions  if any 
see the discussion under segment reporting above for additional information relating to iwm 
service charges on deposit accounts increased in line with the growth in core consumer and commercial deposit balances 
this growth is due not only to a full year of fees related to the farmers acquisition  but also to significant growth in deposits throughout bankshares affiliates 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  in additionally  a reduction in waivers of nonsufficient funds and overdraft charges increased these fees million  or 
commercial account analysis fees increased million  or  primarily due to reduced earnings credits on these accounts as a result of lower interest rates during mortgage banking fees increased to million in bankshares mortgage banking revenue is comprised of loan origination fees  which is the largest category at of total mortgage banking fees  servicing fees  and net gain on sales of mortgage loans 
mercantile mortgage corporation s commercial loan origination and servicing fees increased by a combined million due to the activities of its subsidiary  columbia national real estate financing  llc cnref 
commercial mortgages are brokered  with servicing retained by cnref provided for the investor 
management expects these fees to increase in due to the formation of harborpoint capital  lp  in july of the mortgage banking subsidiary owns a interest in harborpoint capital  lp  a fannie mae delegated underwriting and servicing licensed lender 
harborpoint capital  lp  was a start up in with no noninterest income in residential mortgage banking fees decreased by million due to a slowdown in refinancing activities

bank owned life insurance boli revenues are derived from bankshares investment of million during the third quarter of and investments in insurance contracts on the lives of some directors and key executives 
the company invested in boli to provide funding for future employee benefit costs 
executive and middle management employees are insured under the plan 
income  which reflects changes in the cash surrender value  was million higher than in due to a full year s earnings related to boli investment acquired in the farmers acquisition 
boli investment income is exempt from federal and state income tax  and related costs of the insurance are not tax deductible 
the boli is invested primarily in high grade corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities 
other income includes several categories 
electronic banking fees consist of merchant card processing fees  foreign atm fees and check card fees 
these fees increased by million  up from charges and fees on loans consist of letters of credit fees  late fees and other assessed loan fees 
letters of credit fees increased million  late fees increased million  while other loan fees decreased million 
insurance revenues are derived from fee income related to the sale and servicing of insurance products 
the million increase is due primarily to farmers  which operates two wholly owned subsidiaries  keller stonebraker insurance  inc  and potomac basin group associates  inc 
these insurance agencies provide a full line of consumer and commercial products 
consumer products include annuities  homeowners  automobile  life and personal umbrella insurance products 
commercial products include property and casualty packages  workers compensation  bonds  professional liability and k and other benefit plans 
all other income consists of revenues from various sources  such as safe deposit box rent  travelers checks and money order fees and miscellaneous income 
all other income increased million from due largely to a million gain on the sale of bank premises and a full year of revenue related to farmers

the principal reasons for the year over year increase were the full year inclusion of farmers  boyd watterson and peremel  costs related to the consolidation of bank affiliates into four  costs related to conversion and outsourcing the iwm back office to sungard  and increased professional services related to compliance costs 
controlling costs and maintaining operational efficiencies remains a primary objective for bankshares 
a closely monitored key measure is bankshares overall efficiency ratio 
it is computed by dividing noninterest expenses by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income 
bankshares efficiency ratio was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the cash operating efficiency ratio excludes amortization expense for intangibles and nonoperating income and expenses  such as securities gains and losses and other significant gains  losses or expenses such as those associated with integrating acquired entities operations into bankshares unrelated to bankshares core operations 
bankshares cash operating efficiency ratio was compared with for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see non gaap reconciliation below 
salary related expenses  which include salaries  commissions and incentive compensation are the largest component of noninterest expense at 
salaries increased million  or 
nearly one third of this increase million was due to farmers  boyd watterson and peremel  included in for a full year 
also contributing to the increase were higher commissions and incentive compensation tied directly to bankshares revenue and overall performance of nearly million  higher costs related to new branch openings of million  increases in staffing for compliance related matters of approximately million  with the majority of the remaining increase due to normal merit and staffing increases 
employee benefit expenses increased nearly million  or 
again  approximately one third million was due to the acquisitions in  included in for a full year 
the majority of the remaining increase was due to higher employee and retiree health insurance costs 
net occupancy expense  which includes premises depreciation  rents  maintenance and utilities  increased due to the inclusion for a full year of the net additional branch locations as well as the three corporate offices related to acquisitions 
additionally  generally higher rental payments and an increase in expenses associated with improvements are reflected in the increase to net occupancy expense 
the prior year included million relating to the termination of certain banking lease agreements  primarily related to the farmers integration 
furniture and equipment expenses include depreciation  rental and maintenance expense associated with the upkeep and improvement of hardware and computer software 
these expenses decreased primarily due to expenses related to the cancellation of equipment maintenance contracts with respect to the farmers acquisition and the cancellation of an iwm technology equipment contract in communications and supplies expenses increased due to supplies needed for additional branch office locations  including brochures and operational supplies  as well as increased customer information mailings and disclosures related to the affiliate bank rationalization 
other expenses consist of professional services  marketing  electronic banking  amortization and all other expenses such as travel and membership  licensing and insurance  and other operational expenses 
other expenses increased million  or  in the increase in each category was largely due to acquisitions 
professional fees increased million in part of this increase relates to a change to the directors deferred compensation plan approved at the annual shareholders meeting 
beginning april   all deferred directors fees are covered by the plan 
at april   directors had the option to leave their deferred balance in the old phantom stock plan or convert their balance into vested shares under the new plan 
the phantom stock plan is a cash plan  with changes to the plan balance tied to the changes in the value of shares of mercantile bankshares common stock at the end of each quarter 
substantially all affiliate bank directors converted their balances to the new plan 
this resulted in the addition of approximately  stock equivalents and million to capital surplus 
these vested shares will be issued after a director retires 
professional services increased with costs incurred in connection with the investigation of potential acquisitions of million  legal costs related to investigatory and litigation matters that  in management s view  are not normal recurring expenses of million  and sarbanes oxley compliance costs of million related to section the increase in electronic banking expense of million in was more than offset by the revenues generated from these services referred to in noninterest income section 
amortization of other identifiable intangibles increased to million in from million in as a result of a full year of expense related to acquisitions 
all other expense increases are comprised mostly of travel and membership  up  and licensing and insurance  up million  or 
increases in these two categories are attributable mostly to the increased activities relating to the acquisition of farmers 
additionally  other operational expenses include armored courier service  check clearing and processing charges and other miscellaneous charges 
excluding any charges related to the pending acquisition of community bank of northern virginia cbnv  management expects increases to moderate 
the elimination of certain external professional fees  however  will be partially offset by ongoing investments in bankshares regulatory and compliance infrastructure

analysis of financial condition investment securities bankshares investment securities portfolio is structured to manage liquidity  interest rate risk and regulatory capital and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on investments 
at december   the total investment securities portfolio was billion  a decrease of million  or  from billion at december  the portfolio consists of short term and intermediate term us treasury and us government agency obligations  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities arms and intermediate average life agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
more than of the total investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
as part of a new investment portfolio strategy designed to maintain a core amount of liquidity and to increase portfolio yields in a low interest rate environment  bankshares began to increase its holdings of mortgage backed securities in mortgage backed securities were purchased for the investment portfolio because they have short or intermediate term durations and represent a stable source of cash flows 
as a result of this new program and the farmers acquisition  mortgage backed securities rose million to billion during similarly  the proportion of mortgage backed securities to total available for sale securities increased from in to over the same period in in  us treasury obligations decreased million  or  while us agency obligations increased by million  or 
at year end  the weighted average maturity of the debt securities available for sale portfolio was years  a reduction of years from year end since of this portfolio is mortgage backed securities  the expected remaining maturity may differ from contractual maturity because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature 
the fair value of the bond securities available for sale portfolio as of december  was of amortized cost  compared with at december  at december   these investments had unrealized gains of million and unrealized losses of million 
the market value and unrealized loss on securities as of december   segregated by those securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a year or more  was million and million  respectively 
because the declines in fair value were due to changes in interest rates  not in estimated cash flows  no charge from an other than temporary impairment was recorded at december  the reference point for determining those securities in an unrealized loss is quarter end 
as such  it is possible that a security had a market value that exceeded its amortized cost on other days during the past month period

average total deposits in were billion  representing an increase of billion  or  over the prior year average of billion 
the farmers acquisition accounted for a substantial portion of this growth 
for the year ended december   of the funding for average earning assets was derived from deposits  compared with for the year ended december  the affiliate banking model positions bankshares to compete not only with the large national and regional banking companies in the gathering of these funds  but also with local community banks 
management believes bankshares is positioned to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment 
bankshares continues to promote its cash management services to its commercial customers in order to maintain and expand this key source of funding 
however  should there be an outflow of deposits  a reversal of recent trends  the investment portfolio should provide adequate liquidity 
in  interest bearing deposits represented of average total deposits and were billion  reflecting growth of from the combination of savings  checking plus interest and money market accounts increased on average 
the move to these deposit products reflected customers preference for shorter term investments  given the current interest rate environment 
certificates of deposit  and over and other time deposits increased on average in over total average noninterest bearing deposits rose from billion in to billion in  or 
demand for this product has been strong among both commercial and retail customers throughout the low earnings credit rate resulting from the overall low market interest rates paid on the corporate cash management product required greater deposit balances to be maintained to pay for services 
management expects that as rates rise  the growth in deposit balances related to cash management products may slow  as could fee income growth from these products 
risk management bankshares has established an integrated risk management structure in which senior management regularly identifies  measures and manages risks 
the chief risk officer coordinates and directs the work of several standing management committees charged with managing the risks bankshares faces see below and provides regular reports to the audit committee 
these committees are the asset and liability committee alco which  as described in more detail below  manages interest rate risk  market risk and liquidity risk 
the credit quality committee  which oversees the establishment of consistent credit quality polices  monitors the functioning of the loan review function and determines the allowance for loan and lease loss reserves and related issues 
the compliance committee establishes compliance guidelines and ensures strict compliance with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements for bankshares and its affiliates 
the disclosure committee  comprised of senior representatives of all of bankshares business lines  reviews bankshares periodic filings and disclosures and ensures compliance with the requirements of us securities laws 
in conjunction with the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer  the disclosure committee is charged with the design and oversight of internal controls over financial reporting 
the technology and operations committee evaluates on an ongoing basis risk in bank operations and technology risk to bankshares 
credit risk analysis bankshares loans and commitments are substantially to borrowers located in its immediate region 
bankshares has restricted its participation in multibank credits where bankshares is not the managing or agent bank 
central to the operation of a sound and successful financial institution is the balanced management of asset growth and credit quality 
responsibility for loan underwriting and monitoring is clearly fixed on key management personnel in each of our affiliates and  ultimately  on the boards of directors of each affiliate 
these responsibilities are supported at the holding company level by appropriate underwriting guidelines and effective ongoing loan review 
in addition  bankshares has set an internal limit for each affiliate bank that is well below the regulatory limit on the maximum amount of credit that may be extended to a single borrower 
the lead bank  msd t  has a house limit of million and the house limit at the next largest affiliate is million 
bankshares house limit is million  with exceptions approved by the msd t banking executive committee of the board and bankshares management 
the bankshares loan review function examines each affiliate bank at least once every five quarters 
these examinations provide bankshares management with an independent perspective as to overall loan portfolio quality  risk profile  risk trends and credit administration processes at each affiliate

the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific allocations to impaired loans  general allocations to pools of loans not deemed impaired and an unallocated amount 
the portfolio review and the calculation of the allowance for loan losses are performed on a quarterly basis by bankshares management 
the calculation is reviewed by the bankshares credit quality committee and each affiliate bank as to its specific allowance 
the aggregate calculation establishes a targeted minimum level for the allowance at each affiliate  subject to review and feedback from each affiliate 
final approval rests with the credit quality committee 
the final evaluation is reviewed with the bankshares audit committee 
all loan loss reserves are subject to annual bank regulatory examinations and determinations as to their methodology and adequacy

current trends and economic conditions that affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio are incorporated into the general allocation 
these can include  but are not limited to  exposure to an industry experiencing problems  changes in the nature or volume of the portfolio  delinquency and nonaccrual trends 
the specific allowance allocation is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio by each affiliate bank and loan review 
each loan with an outstanding balance in excess of a specified threshold that is either on nonaccrual status or on the watchlist is evaluated 
the watchlist represents loans identified and closely followed by management 
they possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
monitored loans  which are included in the watchlist  display additional risk characteristics suggesting they may be classified as nonperforming loans in the near feature 
the identified loans are evaluated for potential loss in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
by analyzing current collateral values or present value of cash flows  as well as the capacity of the guarantor  as applicable 
the specific allocation resulting from this review decreased to million from million at december  and  respectively related to specific loan balances of million and million 
the decrease is largely attributable to a charge off related to one credit in the amount of million  where bankshares accepted a payment terminating its interest in that credit 
two remaining credit exposures at msd t accounted for million  based on the fair value of the collateral  of the specific allocation at december  these credits were also specifically reserved at december  see nonperforming assets below for more detail 
the general allowance calculation  which is completed on a quarterly basis  begins with segmentation of the remaining unimpaired portfolio according to loan types 
historical loss factors are maintained for each loan type  providing the starting point of the analysis 
historical loss factors are applied to all non watchlist loans 
management is currently utilizing the past five year loss history specific to each major segment to perform the allocation 
historical loss factors are adjusted to reflect the point in time that management initially identified a potential impairment loss in such risk rated loans  as opposed to when such loss is actually taken as a charge off against the allowance 
this adjustment is necessary  as bankshares practice generally has been to work with its borrowers through their economic difficulties and record a charge off when all recovery efforts have been exhausted 
accordingly  historical losses may tend to lag the national and regional economic cycles 
bankshares also has developed data on probability of default and loss given default  which have been incorporated for the higher risk rated credits  which include watchlist loans that are not currently impaired 
those loss factors are then applied to all loans within the same risk rating 
qualitative factors that may cause credit losses to deviate from average historical experience are then developed 
these include but are not limited to changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  changes in the volume of watchlist loans and nonaccruals  concentrations in a specific industry or geographic location  administrative risk concerns that include changes in the loan review and loan grading system  changes in lending policies and procedures which include underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery practices  changes in management or the staff of any previously mentioned areas  and current economic conditions and indicators 
both internal and external peer data are utilized as applicable to establish these factors 
management s judgment and experience are key to this process 
these factors are revised to address current conditions and trends in the portfolio 
the general allowance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
changes in the general allocation can be attributed to the ongoing refinement of the methodology in quantifying risk segments and estimation techniques used in the calculation 
historical loss factors increased for the commercial and industrial portfolio and the leasing portfolio and reflect the increase in recent charge off activities 
historical loss experience declined in the other portfolios 
improvement in the economy and delinquencies contributed to a lower allocation to each portfolio 
in addition  the general allocation for the commercial and industrial portfolio declined due to the significant decrease in monitored loans from million at december  to million at december  this category has the highest risk rating and corresponding loss allocation for performing loans 
during  management enhanced its risk rating categories to provide more granularity in assessing the overall risk profile of the portfolio 
the increased allocation to residential real estate loans was attributable to this enhancement 
the allowance amount not allocated represents the differential between the combined specific and general allocations and the actual allowance 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the imprecision inherent in estimating and measuring loss when allocating the allowance to individual or pools of loans 
it takes into consideration the allowance level deemed appropriate by each affiliate based on its local knowledge and feedback from bank regulators and their view from the standpoint of safety and soundness  among other factors 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans declined to at december  compared with at december  this reflects overall improving credit quality trends and the disposition  as previously mentioned  of problem credits 
bankshares accepted a million payment  which terminated its interest in one of the two monitored loans secured by commercial aircraft and resulted in a loss of million 
during the provision for loan loss expense was million compared with million in net charge offs increased to million during compared with million during the commercial portfolio represented the largest net charge off amount for at million  or of total net charge offs 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans were

for the years ended december   and  respectively 
intensive collection efforts continue after a loan is charged off in order to maximize the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
recoveries as a percent of loans charged off were in  in and in recoveries in a given year may not relate to loans charged off in that year

the amount of interest income on the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans that was recorded totaled million and million in and  respectively 
note management was monitoring loans estimated to aggregate million at december  and million at december  that were not classified as nonaccrual or renegotiated loans 
these loans had characteristics which indicated they might become nonaccrual in the future 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans and other real estate owned ie  real estate acquired in foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure 
with respect to nonaccrual loans  our policy is that  regardless of the value of the underlying collateral and or guarantees  no interest is accrued on the entire balance once either principal or interest payments on any loan is days past due at the end of a calendar quarter 
all accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed out of interest income and is recognized only as it is collected 
if a loan is impaired and has a specific loss allocation based on an analysis under sfas no 
 all payments are applied against the loan s principal 
a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than this standard if  in management s judgment  such action is warranted 
nonperforming assets as a percent of period end loans and other real estate owned was 
at december  compared with 
in the preceding year 
at year end  nonperforming assets were million compared with million at year end nonperforming loans totaled million at december  compared with million at december  nonperforming loans decreased in all categories of the loan portfolio 
the largest dollar decrease in nonperforming loans was million in the commercial and industrial category  which accounted for of nonperforming loans at december  the decline primarily relates to the previously mentioned acceptance of payment and charge off of a nonperforming loan in the fourth quarter of the restoration of one customer to full accrual status accounted for million of the million decrease in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans 
the level of monitored loans  or loans with characteristics suggesting that they may be classified as nonperforming in the near future  decreased during the year 
at december   monitored loans were million compared with million a year before 
bankshares had two loans in the monitored category that were made in and and were secured by commercial aircraft 
on november   bankshares accepted a million payment  which terminated its interest in one of the loans 
this loan had an outstanding principal balance of million at that date 
the million difference was charged against the allowance for loan losses in the fourth quarter of although both loans continued to be performing in accordance with their terms  management s decision to accept this payment was attributable to a number of factors including the noncore nature of the loan  the residual risk and the risk of declining collateral value  and continuing concerns about the commercial airline industry 
the other loan to the same borrower represents a million exposure and remains in the monitored category 
this loan matures in february and carries a significant guarantee 
other real estate owned was thousand at december  compared with thousand at december  these properties generally are sold within a short period 
therefore  regardless of the amount  the properties generally will have changed from year to year 
other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
refer to the data in the nonperforming assets chart above  which shows the changes in the amounts of various categories of nonperforming assets over the last five years and sets forth the relationship between nonperforming loans and total loans

asset liability and market risk management asset liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring and management of interest rate risk  market risk  liquidity and funding 
the asset liability management committee oversees policy guidelines and reports periodically to the audit committee of the board of directors 
this committee consists of senior financial and business executives 
treasury division management and other finance personnel monitor the day to day exposure to interest rates in response to loan and deposit flows 
interest rate risk interest rate risk  which potentially can have a significant earnings impact  is an integral part of being a financial intermediary 
bankshares is subject to interest rate risk due to a variety of factors including assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times for example  currently our assets reprice faster than our liabilities and if interest rates fall  earnings will initially decline  assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts for example  when the market level of interest rates is falling  we may reduce rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general decline in market interest rates  short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts ie  the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan and investment yields and funding costs differently  or the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example  if long term mortgage rates fall  mortgage backed securities may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated  which could reduce portfolio income 
in addition  interest rate changes have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses  mortgage originations  the value of mortgage servicing rights and other sources of earnings 
a balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its assets loans and securities reprice faster or to a greater extent than liabilities deposits and borrowings 
an asset sensitive balance sheet will produce more net interest income when rates rise and less net interest income when rates fall 
a balance sheet is described as liability sensitive when its liabilities deposits or borrowings reprice more frequently or to a greater degree than its assets loans and securities 
a liability sensitive balance sheet will produce a lower level of net interest income when interest rates rise and more net interest income when rates fall 
bankshares large and relatively rate insensitive deposit base funds a portfolio with a large percentage of floating rate commercial and consumer loans  which creates a bias towards asset sensitivity 
to manage this asset sensitivity in our balance sheet  we maintain a large portfolio of fixed rate  although short duration  investments 
periodically  we elect to use derivatives to protect assets and liabilities from changes in interest rates 
when deciding whether to use derivatives instead of cash market instruments to achieve the same goal  we consider a number of factors  such as cost  efficiency  the effect on our liquidity and capital  and our overall strategy 
the derivatives we use for interest rate risk management purposes are primarily interest rate swaps 
we fully incorporate the market risk associated with interest rate risk management derivatives into our earnings simulation model in the same manner as other on balance sheet financial instruments 
we analyze and manage interest rate risk by forecasting a wide range of interest rate scenarios for time periods as long as months 
however  in analyzing interest rate sensitivity for policy measurement  we compare our forecasted net interest income in both high rate and low rate scenarios to our most likely earnings estimate utilizing a flat rate scenario 
the policy measurement periods are and months in length  beginning with the first month of the forecast 
our objective is to manage prudently the interest bearing assets and liabilities on our balance sheet in ways that minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our policy is to limit the risk we take through balance sheet management actions to and of our net interest income in the month and month measurement periods  respectively 
our high rate and low rate scenarios assume gradual and basis point increases or decreases in the federal funds rate relative to the flat rate scenario 
our standard approach evaluates expected net interest income in a basis point range both above and below the flat rate scenario 
however  due to the currently low absolute levels of interest rates  we have modified the low rate scenario to measure a decline of basis points 
to capture the impact of yield curve related risk  we simultaneously measure the impact of nonparallel shifts in rates 
a parallel shift would move all points on the yield curve by the same increments 
a nonparallel shift would consist of a basis point increase in short term rates  while long term rates would increase by a different amount 
a rate shift in which short term rates rise to a greater extent than long term rates is referred to as a flattening of the yield curve 
conversely  long term rates rising to a greater extent than short term rates would lead to a steepening of the yield curve 
improving economic growth in the first half of resulted in the federal reserve board adjusting its position on the level of interest rates 
whereas the federal reserve board continued to pursue an accommodative monetary policy in  it began tightening monetary policy on june  by december   the federal reserve board had raised interest rates by basis points 
as a result  the historically steep yield curve environment that persisted in began to shift to a flatter yield curve environment 
accordingly  throughout we evaluated rate shifts that included a flattening of the yield curve 
interest rate risk management decisions are made based on a composite view of both parallel and nonparallel shifts 
bankshares consolidated balance sheet had been positioned for a rate rise  and the increase in net interest income reflects some of the benefit of the federal reserve board rate increases 
additionally  in we continued our investment strategy of shifting the portfolio mix into a higher percentage of mortgage backed securities 
we use mortgage backed securities as a hedge against both rising and falling interest rates  depending on their purchase price  which has a significant impact on their yield in different rate environments 
we selectively include current coupon mortgage securities in our portfolio as a hedge against a continued low rate environment 
mortgage securities purchased at a discount are used to hedge against declining rates 
earnings sensitivity the following table summarizes the effect a positive and basis point change and a negative basis point change in interest rates would have on bankshares net interest income over the next months 
calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income change in interest rates as of december  basis points as seen in the earnings sensitivity table above  within a one year horizon  the earnings sensitivity model forecasts that  compared with the net interest income projection under stable rates  net interest income would increase by and if interest rates increased by and basis points  respectively  and that net interest income would decrease by if interest rates decreased by basis points 
these results are not necessarily indicative of future actual results  nor do they take into account certain actions that management may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates 
market risk market risk is defined as the constraint imposed by lower market values of assets and liabilities as interest rates and equity markets fluctuate 
changes in market values also impact the fee income earned by iwm  where a significant portion of the fee schedule is tied to current asset values under management or administration 
bankshares has designated substantially all of its investment portfolio as available for sale  and in accordance with financial reporting standards  this portfolio is reported at fair value 
changes in fair value  net of tax  are reflected as a component of shareholders equity 
trading activities in  we began marketing capital markets products to our customers 
from a market risk perspective  bankshares net income is exposed to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity and their implied volatilities 
the primary purpose of the capital markets group business is to accommodate customers in the management of their market price risks 
derivative transactions executed with customers are simultaneously hedged in the capital markets 
all derivatives transacted with customers or used to hedge capital market transactions with customers are carried at fair value 
the asset liability management committee establishes and monitors counterparty risk limits 
the notional amount  exposure amount and estimated net fair value of all customer accommodation derivatives at december  are included in note no 
of the financial statements 
equity markets we are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets 
we make and manage direct equity investments in start up businesses  emerging growth companies and other corporate capitalizations 
we also invest in hedge funds managers that make similar investments 
these private equity investments are made within capital allocations approved by bankshares management 
management reviews these investments at least quarterly and assesses them for possible other than temporary impairment 
for nonmarketable investments  the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the expectations for that investment s cash flows and capital needs  the viability of the business model and an appropriate exit strategy 
private equity investments totaled million at december  and million at december  hedge funds investment totaled million at december  and million at december  changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect bankshares net income by affecting the value of third party assets under management or administration and  hence  fee income  by affecting particular borrowers  whose ability to repay principal and or interest may be affected by the stock market  or by affecting brokerage activity  related commission income and other business activities  and by affecting the income derived from the value of hedge funds investments 
bankshares maintenance of capital ratios well above regulatory requirements see capital resources and adequacy below provides management with the flexibility to utilize the available for sale portfolio for liquidity and interest rate risk management needs  even during a period when valuations are depressed 
maintaining a fairly short duration in the portfolio also mitigates market risk 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that bankshares will not be able to fund present and future financial obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain the ability to meet commitments to fund loans  purchase securities and repay deposits and other liabilities in accordance with their terms 
to achieve this objective  the asset liability management committee establishes and monitors liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over reliance on volatile  less reliable funding markets 
debt securities in the available for sale portfolio provide asset liquidity  in addition to the immediately liquid resources of cash and due from banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
by limiting the maturity of securities and maintaining a conservative investment posture  management can rely on the investment portfolio to help meet any short term funding needs 
us treasury and us agency securities  which provide the greatest liquidity  averaged billion in  a decrease from the average of billion in core customer deposits historically have provided a sizable source of relatively stable and low cost funds 
at december   core deposits total deposits less certificates of deposit of  and over  averaged billion compared with billion at december  however  should there be an outflow of deposits  a reversal of recent trends  the investment portfolio should provide adequate liquidity 
although not viewed as core deposits  a substantial portion of short term borrowings comprised of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and commercial paper originate from core deposit relationships tied to the overnight cash management program offered to customers 
short term borrowings averaged million during  a increase from the level 
short term borrowings were million at december  and million at december  in addition to these sources  bankshares has access to national markets for certificates of deposit  commercial paper and debt financing 
should bankshares need to supplement its liquidity  it also has billion in lines with the federal home loan bank atlanta fhlb and back up commercial paper lines of million with commercial banks 
bankshares is required to obtain approval from holders of bankshares and unsecured senior notes if bankshares incrementally borrows in excess of million under the fhlb lines 
long term debt increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the sale of the hopkins plaza building which  based on the terms of the sales agreement  under the applicable accounting rules was required to be treated as a financing of the million sale price 
during  million was repaid on previously existing long term debt 
bankshares can access the capital markets for long term funding by issuing registered debt and private placements

capital resources and adequacy bankshares has consistently maintained a capital to asset ratio higher than its peers  as reported in data furnished by its regulators 
shareholders equity averaged billion during  which represented an increase of million  or  over the prior year s average 
maintenance of capital strength has long been a guiding principle of bankshares 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  to provide a measure of protection against unanticipated declines in asset values and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also provides a source of funds to meet loan demand and enables bankshares to manage its assets and liabilities effectively 
shareholders equity increased to billion at year end from billion at year end the increase can be attributed primarily to earnings growth offset by increased cash dividend payments and share repurchases 
book value per share was at december  compared with at december  the ratio of average equity to average assets was in and in  ranking bankshares among the most strongly capitalized banks in the industry 
excluding intangible assets  average tangible equity to average tangible assets was in and in while maintaining exceptional capital strength and financing growth of the corporation  bankshares also has pursued a share repurchase program 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of common stock under these programs 
at december   there remained  shares of common stock authorized for repurchase 
the share repurchase program has supported management s strategy to enhance shareholder value 
management has repurchased shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions during periods when capital accumulates at a rate in excess of that required to support the growth of earning assets 
see note no 
of the financial statements and the statements of changes in consolidated shareholders equity below for details related to the share repurchase program 
various bank regulatory agencies have implemented capital guidelines  which are directly related to a bank s risk based capital ratios 
by regulatory definition  a well capitalized institution  such as bankshares  faces fewer regulatory constraints on its operations than institutions classified as undercapitalized 
for example  only well capitalized banks can accept brokered deposits without advance regulatory approval 
in addition  fdic deposit insurance premium rates are significantly lower for banks with higher capital levels 
the tier i capital ratios graph above shows that bankshares has maintained capital levels well in excess of the regulatory minimum over each of the last five years

bank regulatory agencies also impose certain restrictions on transactions among and between subsidiaries of bank holding companies  including extensions of credit  transfers of assets and payments of dividends 
historically  the dividend restrictions have not limited dividend payments at bankshares  and it is not anticipated that they will have a constraining effect in the future 
in addition to dividend restrictions  capital requirements also are affected by off balance sheet risks 
these include such items as letters of credit and commitments to extend credit

in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the task force discussed the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments carried at cost 
the task force requested that the fasb staff consider other impairment models within us gaap when developing its views 
the task force also requested that the scope of the impairment issue be expanded to include equity investments and investments subject to fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and that that issue be addressed by the task force as a separate eitf issue 
at the eitf meeting  the task force reached a consensus on one issue that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be required for securities accounted for under statement that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
the board ratified the consensus on that one issue at its november  meeting 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb directed the fasb staff to issue two proposed fasb staff positions fsp proposed fsp eitf issue a  which provides guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf issue to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases  and proposed fsp eitf issue b  which delays the effective date of issue for debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases 
the outcome of the proposed guidance under certain interpretations could have an adverse impact on bankshares capital and earnings as it relates to securities deemed impaired within the available for sale investment portfolio
