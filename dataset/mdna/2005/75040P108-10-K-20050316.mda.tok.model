table of contents the african american market opportunity we believe that operating urban formatted radio stations primarily targeting african americans continues to have significant growth potential for the following reasons rapid african american population growth

in addition  the african american consumer tends to have a different consumption profile than non african americans 
an annual report published by target market news provides a list of products and services for which african american households spent more than white households 
in the most recent such annual report  there were dozens of such products and services listed in categories such as apparel and accessories  appliances  consumer electronics  food  personal care products  telephone service and transportation

growth in advertising targeting the african american market 
we continue to believe that large corporate advertisers are becoming more focused on reaching minority consumers in the united states 
the african american community is considered an emerging growth market within the mature domestic market 
it is estimated that major national advertisers spent over billion on advertising that targets african american consumers in  up from million in source target market news 
we believe many large corporations are expanding their commitment to ethnic advertising 
growing influence of african american culture 
we believe that there continues to be an ongoing urbanization of many facets of american society as evidenced by the influence of african american culture in the areas of music for example  hip hop and rap music  film  fashion  sports and urban oriented television shows and networks 
we believe that many companies from a broad range of industries and prominent fashion designers have embraced this urbanization trend in their products as well as their advertising messages 
growing popularity of radio formats primarily targeting african americans 
we believe that urban programming has been expanded to target a more diverse urban listener base and has become more popular with listeners and advertisers over the past ten years 
nationwide  the number of urban radio stations has increased from in to in  or

relative to radio broadcasters targeting a broader audience  we believe we can cover the various segments of our target market with fewer programming formats and therefore fewer radio stations than the maximum per market allowed by the fcc

in  african americans  age and older  spent hours per week listening to radio 
this compared to hours per week for all americans  age and older 
source black radio today edition  arbitron  inc and radio today edition  arbitron  inc 
we believe that african american radio listeners exhibit greater loyalty to radio stations that target the african american community because those radio stations become a valuable source of entertainment and information responsive to the community s interests and lifestyles 
acquisition strategy our acquisition strategy is to acquire underperforming radio stations and stick stations primarily in the top african american markets 
a stick station is a station generating little or no revenue or cash flow at the time of acquisition that we subsequently reformat or relocate 
we seek to make acquisitions in existing markets where expanded coverage is desirable and in new markets where we believe it is advantageous to establish a presence 
for strategic reasons  or as a result of an acquisition of multiple stations in a market  we may also acquire and operate stations with formats that primarily target non african american segments of the population

table of contents operating strategy to maximize net broadcast revenue and station operating income at our radio stations  we strive to achieve the largest audience share of african american listeners in each market  convert these audience share ratings to advertising revenue  and control operating expenses 
through our national presence we also provide advertisers with a radio station advertising platform that is a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to african americans 
the success of our strategy relies on the following market research  targeted programming and marketing  strong management and performance based incentives  radio station clustering  programming segmentation and sales bundling  strategic sales efforts  marketing platform to national advertisers  advertising partnerships and special events  and significant community involvement 
market research  targeted programming and marketing we use market research to tailor the programming  marketing and promotions of our radio stations to maximize audience share 
we also use our research to reinforce our current programming and to identify unserved or underserved markets or segments of the african american population and to determine whether to acquire a new radio station or reprogram one of our existing radio stations to target those markets or segments 
we also seek to reinforce our targeted programming by creating a distinct and marketable identity for each of our radio stations 
to achieve this objective  in addition to our significant community involvement discussed below  we employ and promote distinct  high profile on air personalities at many of our radio stations  many of whom have strong ties to the african american community 
strong management and performance based incentives we focus on hiring and retaining highly motivated and talented individuals in each functional area of our organization who can effectively help us implement our growth and operating strategies 
our management team is comprised of a diverse group of individuals who bring significant expertise to their functional areas 
we seek to hire and promote individuals with significant potential and the ability to operate with high levels of autonomy 
to enhance the quality of our management in the areas of sales and programming  general managers  sales managers and program directors have significant portions of their compensation tied to the achievement of certain performance goals 
general managers compensation is based partially on achieving station operating income benchmarks  which creates an incentive for management to focus on both sales growth and expense control 
additionally  sales managers and sales personnel have incentive packages based on sales goals  and program directors and on air talent have incentive packages focused on maximizing ratings in specific target segments 
radio station clustering  programming segmentation and sales bundling we strive to build clusters of radio stations in our markets  with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the african american population 
this clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration into each segment of our target market 
we are then able to offer advertisers multiple audiences and to bundle the radio stations for advertising sales purposes when advantageous 
we believe there are several potential benefits that result from operating multiple radio stations in the same market 
first  each additional radio station in a market provides us with a larger percentage of the prime advertising time available for sale within that market 
second  the more stations we program  the greater the market share we can achieve in our target demographic groups through the use of segmented programming 
third  we are often able to consolidate sales  promotional  technical support and business functions to produce substantial cost savings 
finally  the purchase of additional radio stations in an existing market allows us to take advantage of our market expertise and existing relationships with advertisers 

table of contents strategic sales efforts we have assembled an effective  highly trained sales staff responsible for converting audience share into revenue 
we operate with a focused  sales oriented culture which rewards aggressive selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure 
we hire and deploy large teams of sales professionals for each of our stations or station clusters  and we provide these teams with the resources necessary to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate 
we utilize various sales strategies to sell and market our stations as stand alones  in combination with other stations within a given market  and across markets  where appropriate 
marketing platform to national advertisers through our acquisitions  we have created a national platform of radio stations in some of the largest african american markets 
this platform reaches over million listeners weekly  more than any other media vehicle primarily targeting african americans 
thus  national advertisers find advertising on all our radio stations an efficient and cost effective way to reach this target audience 
through our corporate sales department  we bundle and sell our platform of radio stations to national advertisers thereby enhancing our revenue generating opportunities  expanding our base of advertisers  creating greater demand for our advertising time inventory and increasing the capacity utilization of our inventory and making our sales effort more efficient 
advertising partnerships and special events we believe that in order to create advertising loyalty  we must strive to be the recognized expert in marketing to the african american consumer in the markets in which we operate 
we believe that we have achieved this recognition by focusing on serving the african american consumer and by creating innovative advertising campaigns and promotional tie ins with our advertising clients and sponsoring numerous entertainment events each year 
in these events  advertisers buy signage  booth space and broadcast promotions to sell a variety of goods and services to african american consumers 
as we expand our presence in our existing markets and into new markets  we may increase the number of events and the number of markets in which we host events based upon our evaluation of the financial viability and economic benefits of such events 
significant community involvement we believe our active involvement and significant relationships in the african american community provide a competitive advantage in targeting african american audiences 
in this way  we believe our proactive involvement in the african american community in each of our markets significantly improves the marketability of our radio broadcast time to advertisers who are targeting such communities 
we believe that a radio station s image should reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic group it serves 
due to our fundamental understanding of the african american community  we believe we are able to identify music and musical styles  as well as political and social trends and issues  early in their evolution 
this understanding is then integrated into significant aspects of our operations and enables us to create enhanced awareness and name recognition in the marketplace 
in addition  we believe our multi level approach to community involvement leads to increased effectiveness in developing and updating our programming formats 
we believe our enhanced awareness and more effective programming formats lead to greater listenership and higher ratings over the long term 
turnaround expertise prior to acquisition by us  many of our stations were  in our opinion  underperforming 
by implementing our operating strategy  we have succeeded in increasing the ratings  net broadcast revenue and station operating income of many of the fm stations we have acquired 
we have achieved these improvements while  in many instances  competing against larger media companies 
our turnaround strategy has been especially successful with respect to our operations in atlanta  cincinnati  dallas  detroit and raleigh

wrou fm was formerly known as wrnb fm 

table of contents advertising revenue substantially all of our net broadcast revenue is generated from the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
local sales are made by the sales staff located in our markets 
national sales are made by firms specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level 
these firms are paid a commission on the advertising sold 
approximately of our net broadcast revenue for the year ended december  was generated from the sale of local advertising and from sales to national advertisers  including network advertising 
the balance of net broadcast revenue is primarily derived from tower rental income  ticket sales and revenue related to radio one sponsored events and other revenue 
we believe that advertisers can reach the african american community more cost effectively through radio broadcasting than through newspapers or television 
advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on a radio station s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours 
a radio station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to a radio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station 
ratings are used by advertisers to evaluate whether to advertise on our radio stations  and are used by us to chart audience growth  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
strategic diversification we continually explore opportunities in other forms of media that are complementary to our core radio business  which we believe will allow us to leverage our expertise in the african american market and our significant listener base 
we currently have invested in the following media businesses tv one  which operates a cable television network offering programming targeted primarily towards african american viewers see discussion below  reach media  inc  which operates the tom joyner morning show  a leading  nationally syndicated radio program  and related businesses see significant and recent events reach media  inc acquisition above  and ibiquity digital corporation ibiquity  a leading developer of in band on channel digital broadcast technology 
in july  we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of comcast corporation and other investors to form tv one  llc  an entity formed to launch a cable television network featuring lifestyle  entertainment and news related programming targeted primarily towards african american viewers 
we have committed to make a cash investment of approximately million in tv one  of which we already have funded million 
we have provided  and will continue to provide  advertising and management services to tv one through january  for which we received additional equity in tv one 
in december  tv one entered into a distribution agreement with directv  inc and certain affiliates of directv became investors in tv one 
as of december   we owned approximately of tv one on a fully diluted basis  and comcast owned a slightly smaller stake 
we are currently seeking to generate additional revenue from our new and existing radio station websites by increasing traffic on those websites and attracting new advertisers 
future opportunities could include investments in  or acquisitions of  companies in diverse media businesses  such as an urban oriented radio network potentially through reach  outdoor advertising in urban environments  music production and distribution  publishing  internet based services  and other related businesses 

table of contents competition the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
radio one s stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as television  the internet  satellite radio  newspapers  magazines  direct mail and outdoor advertising  some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies 
audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net broadcast revenue in that market 
if a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations  or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue 
other radio companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter  or increase their presence in  markets where we operate 
although we believe our stations are well positioned to compete  we cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current ratings or advertising revenue 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies  which may impact our business 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies are being  or have been  developed  including the following satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  and digital audio and video content available for listening and or viewing on the internet and or available to be downloaded to portable devices 
as a response to these and other competing technologies  we have entered into an alliance with xm satellite radio  whereby we program one channel on xm satellite radio s satellite delivered digital audio radio service 
additionally  we  along with most other public radio companies  have invested in ibiquity  a developer of digital audio broadcast technology 
very recently  we and most of these public radio companies as well as many privately held radio companies have committed over the course of the next four years to convert most analog broadcast radio stations to in band  on channel digital radio broadcasts  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services 
however  we cannot assure you that these arrangements will be successful or enable us to adapt effectively to these new media technologies 
antitrust regulation an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio stations 
the agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws  the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice  may investigate certain acquisitions 
after the passage of the telecommunications act of  the department of justice gave increased attention to reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations 
the department of justice is likely to focus particular attention when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
the department of justice has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the department of justice has more closely scrutinized radio station acquisitions where the involved radio stations account for a significant percentage of local radio advertising revenue 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific department of justice or ftc review of a particular acquisition 
any decision by the department of justice or ftc to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate an acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino act requires the parties to file notification and report forms concerning antitrust issues with the department of justice and the ftc and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
if the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction  the parties involved frequently engage in lengthy discussions and or negotiations with the investigating agency to address those issues  including restructuring the proposed acquisition or divesting assets 
in addition  the investigating agency could file suit in federal court to enjoin the acquisition or to require the divestiture of assets  among other remedies 
all acquisitions  regardless of whether they are required to be reported under the hart scott rodino act  may be investigated by the department of justice or the ftc under the antitrust laws before or after consummation 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its increased scrutiny of radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that local marketing agreements  joint sales agreements  time brokerage agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers could violate the hart scott rodino act if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act 
furthermore  the department of justice has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under section of the sherman act and has challenged joint sales agreements in certain locations 
as indicated above  the 
table of contents department of justice also has stated publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to radio station acquisitions  above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny 
however  to date  the department of justice has also investigated transactions that do not meet or exceed these benchmarks and has cleared transactions that do exceed these benchmarks 
in the past  the federal communications commission fcc has exercised its discretion to review individual fcc assignment or transfer of control applications involving proposed radio broadcasting transactions that it believes might raise excessive market concentration issues even where an application complies with the fcc s media ownership limits 
as part of its june decision revising media ownership rules  which proceeding is discussed below  the fcc announced that it would no longer follow this former practice of flagging certain assignment and transfer of control applications that raise competitive concerns for its staff to conduct a competitive analysis of the particular market 
the fcc continues to adhere to this shift in practice during the pendency of a temporary judicial stay of the revised media ownership rules adopted in the june decision 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the fcc of programming  technical operations  employment and other business practices 
the fcc regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the communications act of  as amended 
the communications act permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest  convenience and necessity 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations  operating power  interference standards and other technical parameters of radio broadcast stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses  imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs  establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions  adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation  program content and employment and business practices of radio broadcast stations  and has the power to impose penalties  including monetary forfeitures  for violations of its rules and the communications act 
the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and specific fcc rules and policies 
this summary does not purport to be a complete listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations and is qualified in its entirety by the text of the communications act  the fcc s rules  regulations and policies  and the rulings and public notices of the fcc 
you should refer to the communications act and these fcc notices  rules and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of an fcc license  or transfer of control of an fcc licensee  without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant requests for consents to assignments or transfers  and in determining whether to grant or renew a radio broadcast license  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee and any proposed licensee  including restrictions on foreign ownership  compliance with fcc media ownership limits and other fcc rules  the character of the licensee or proposed licensee and those persons holding attributable interests in the licensee or proposed licensee  and compliance with the anti drug abuse act of a licensee s failure to comply with the requirements of the communications act or fcc rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions  including admonishment  fines  the grant of a license renewal of less than a full eight year term  the grant of a license or license renewal with conditions or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application  the revocation of an fcc license and or the denial of fcc consent to acquire additional broadcast properties 

table of contents congress  the fcc and  in some cases  local jurisdictions  have had under consideration or reconsideration  or may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions 
such matters include or may include changes to the license authorization and renewal process  proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on fcc licensees  changes to rules relating to political broadcasting including proposals to grant free air time to candidates  and other changes regarding political and non political program content  funding  political advertising rates  and sponsorship disclosures  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages  proposals regarding the regulation of the broadcast of indecent or violent content  proposals to increase the actions stations must take to demonstrate service to their local communities  technical and frequency allocation matters  changes in broadcast multiple ownership  foreign ownership  cross ownership and ownership attribution policies  including the definition of the local market for multiple ownership purposes and the attribution of joint sales agreements for purposes of the fcc s multiple ownership rules  changes to allow telephone companies to deliver audio and video programming to homes in their service areas  and proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions 
finally  the fcc has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to construct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations 
such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  might be adopted  nor can we predict what other matters might be considered in the future  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on our business 
fcc license grants and renewals 
in making licensing determinations  the fcc considers an applicant s legal  technical  financial and other qualifications 
the fcc grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and  upon application  may renew them for additional terms 
a station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending 
under the communications act  radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years 
generally  the fcc renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that the radio station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations  and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations which  taken together  indicate a pattern of abuse 
after considering these factors and any petitions to deny a license renewal application which may lead to a hearing  the fcc may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions  including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted 
historically  our licenses have been renewed without any conditions or sanctions imposed 
however  there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed  will be renewed for a full term or will be renewed without conditions or sanctions 
in august  chairman powell announced the creation of a localism task force to advise the fcc on steps the fcc and congress can take to strengthen localism in television and radio broadcasting 
additionally  on july   the fcc released a notice of inquiry to receive direct input from the public on how broadcasters are serving their communities 
the localism task force s findings and recommendations  as well as actions taken by the fcc based on comments received in response to notice of inquiry  could affect future licensing decisions 
types of fcc broadcast licenses 
the fcc classifies each am and fm radio station 
an am radio station operates on either a clear channel  regional channel or local channel 
a clear channel is assigned to serve wide areas  particularly at night 
a regional 
table of contents channel is assigned to serve primarily a principal center of population and the rural areas contiguous to it 
a local channel is assigned to operate unlimited time and serve primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it 
class a radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area 
class b radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render service only over a primary service area 
class d radio stations operate either daytime  during limited times only  or unlimited time with low nighttime power 
class c radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm radio station is located 
the minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an fm radio station are determined by its class 
in general  commercial fm radio stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c and c 
the fcc has adopted a rule that subjects class c fm stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to class c under certain circumstances 
radio one s licenses 
the following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations 
a broadcast station s market may be different from its community of license 
the coverage of an am radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station s transmitter  less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments 
for fm radio stations  signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the erp of the radio station s antenna and the haat of the radio station s antenna 
erp refers to the effective radiated power of an fm radio station 
haat refers to the antenna height above average terrain of an fm radio station

renewal of the license is currently pending before the fcc 

table of contents to obtain the fcc s prior consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license an appropriate application must be filed with the fcc 
if the application to assign or transfer the license involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee  for example  the transfer or acquisition of more than of the voting stock  the long form application must be placed on an fcc public notice for a period of days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed by interested parties 
informal objections may be filed any time until the fcc acts upon the application 
if the fcc grants an assignment or transfer application  administrative procedures provide for reconsideration of the grant 
the communications act also permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court in certain instances 
under the communications act  a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any persons who are not us citizens  whom the communications act and fcc rules refer to as aliens  including any corporation that has more than of its capital stock owned or voted by non us citizens or entities or their representatives  by foreign governments or their representatives  or by non us corporations 
furthermore  the communications act prohibits indirect foreign ownership through a parent company of the licensee of more than if the fcc determines the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license 
thus  for instance  the licenses for our stations could be revoked if more than of our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of non us citizens 
the fcc generally applies its media ownership limits  which are discussed below  to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association or entity  including limited liability companies 
in the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses  the interests of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly hold five percent or more of the total outstanding votes of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests 
certain passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of or more of the voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses 
an entity with one or more radio stations in a radio market that enters into a local marketing agreement or a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station for purposes of the fcc s local radio station ownership rules  if the brokering station supplies more than of the brokered radio station s weekly broadcast hours 
similarly  under a new fcc rule  a station licensee s rights under a contract to sell more than per week of the advertising time on another station in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest for purposes of the fcc s ownership rules 
this new rule was adopted as part of a larger media ownership decision that was challenged in court 
the united states court of appeals for the third circuit remanded to the fcc many of the rules promulgated as part of the fcc s media ownership decision and stayed the new rules pending further proceedings by the fcc and review by the court 
as a result  the fcc reverted to applying its old rules 
the fcc also filed a petition to lift the court s stay 
the third circuit agreed to lift portions of the stay  including with respect to the attribution of a contract to sell advertising time 
in response  the fcc revised its application forms for transfers of control and assignments of licenses to incorporate these aspects of the new rules  and the fcc is now applying such revisions to all pending and new applications 
under the fcc s current policies  debt instruments  non voting stock  options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised  minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder and insulated limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the interest holder is not materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership or company generally do not subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the fcc s equity debt plus or edp rule 
under the edp rule  a major programming supplier or a same market media entity will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same market media entity also holds debt or equity  or both  in the station that is greater than of the value of the station s total debt plus equity 
for purposes of the edp rule  equity includes all stock  whether voting or nonvoting  and equity held by insulated limited partners or limited liability company members 
debt includes all liabilities  whether long term or short term 
a major programming supplier includes any programming supplier that provides more than of the station s weekly programming hours 
a same market media entity subject to the ownership restrictions applicable to radio stations includes any holder of an attributable interest in a broadcast station or daily newspaper  located in the same market as the station  but only if the holder s interest is attributable under an fcc attribution rule other than the edp rule 
the communications act and fcc rules generally restrict ownership  operation or control of  or the common holding of attributable interests in radio broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market  radio broadcast stations combined with television broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market radio television cross ownership  and a radio broadcast station and an english language daily newspaper serving the same local market newspaper broadcast cross ownership 

table of contents these media ownership rules are subject to periodic review by the fcc 
in its media ownership decision  the fcc voted to retain the limits it previously had on the number of radio broadcast stations one entity may own  control  or in which it may have an attributable interest  within a local market 
the rules were challenged in court  and the third circuit held that the fcc did not adequately justify its radio ownership limits and stayed their implementation 
the fcc therefore continues to use the numerical limits 
after the third circuit partially lifted its stay but not with respect to the ownership limits the fcc revised its application forms for transfers of control and assignments of licenses to incorporate these aspects of the new rules  and the fcc is now applying such revisions to all pending and new applications 
the numerical limits on radio stations that one entity may own in a local market  that were in place prior to the media ownership decision  and retained in that decision but subject to further review based on the third circuit s decision  are as follows in a radio market with or more commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations  not more than five of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with to commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with to commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to six commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with or fewer commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to five commercial radio stations  not more than three of which are in the same service am or fm  except that a party may not own  operate  or control more than percent of the radio stations in such market 
to apply these four local numerical caps or tiers  the fcc has adopted rules for defining local radio market areas and the number of radio stations in such markets 
for a number of years  the fcc employed a contour overlap methodology 
as part of the media ownership decision  the fcc decided to rely on arbitron metro survey areas in portions of the country where they exist  rather than the contour overlap methodology 
it also grandfathered existing local radio combinations that conflicted with the new rules based on the revised market definition until the combination is sold 
while these changes were initially subject to the third circuit s stay  at the request of the fcc the third circuit decided to lift its stay with respect to the use of arbitron metro survey areas and the transferability restrictions 
following the partial lifting of the stay  the fcc revised its forms as described above 
it is important to note that the market definition employed by the fcc to determine compliance with its rules is not necessarily the same as that used for purposes of the hart scott rodino act 
in addition  for radio stations located outside arbitron metro survey areas  the fcc instituted a rulemaking to determine how to define local radio markets in such areas 
in the interim  the fcc is applying a modified contour overlap methodology 
under this approach  the fcc uses one overlapping contour methodology for defining a local radio market and counting the number of stations that the applicant controls or proposes to control in that market  and it employs a separate overlapping contour methodology for determining the number of operating commercial radio stations in the market for determining compliance with the local radio ownership caps 
in its media ownership decision  the fcc also voted to adopt more liberal cross media limits to replace the former newspaper broadcast and radio television cross ownership rules 
it voted to grandfather existing radio or radio television combinations that otherwise would violate the revised media ownership rules until the combination is sold 
these provisions have been remanded by the third circuit for further fcc consideration and are currently subject to a judicial stay 
the rules adopted in the fcc s ownership decision are still in flux and subject both to further court proceedings and proceedings at the fcc 
certain of the parties to the third circuit s decision have requested review by the united states supreme court  which requests remain pending 
at the fcc  the rules are currently on remand from the third circuit and the fcc has yet to institute further proceedings 
there are also petitions for reconsideration of the ownership decision on file and pending at the fcc 
in addition  the fcc s media ownership rules are subject to periodic review by the fcc 
the next periodic review is scheduled to begin in all of these attribution and media ownership rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we want to sell 
the form that the fcc s new rules eventually take  following any further fcc and court action  could affect our business in a number of ways  including  but not limited to  the following enforcement of a more narrow market definition based upon arbitron markets could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area or to sell a group of stations in a local market to a single entity 

table of contents restricting the assignment and transfer of control of radio combinations that exceed the new ownership limits as a result of the revised local market definitions could adversely affect our ability to buy or sell a group of stations in a local market from or to a single entity 
attributing joint sales agreements for multiple ownership purposes could limit our ability to buy or sell time on certain stations 
in general terms  if the fcc changes the way it defines markets or determines excess market concentration for purposes of the broadcast multiple ownership rules  we could be limited in our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets  in our ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements  and in our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations 
programming and operations 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest by presenting programming in response to community problems  needs and interests and maintaining certain records demonstrating its responsiveness 
the fcc will consider complaints from listeners about a broadcast station s programming  and such complaints are required to be maintained in a station s public file for two years 
stations also must pay fcc regulatory and application fees  and follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political advertising  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  sponsorship identification  the broadcast of contests and lotteries and technical operation  including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation 
the fcc s rules prohibit a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service that is  am am or fm fm 
the simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement  and only if the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner 
the fcc requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices 
in november  the fcc adopted new eeo rules  which became effective march   that bar employment discrimination by broadcast stations on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin or gender 
they also require station employment units with at least five full time employees to widely disseminate information about all full time job openings  absent certain limited exceptions  to recruitment sources  including those requesting to be on the job vacancy notification list  so as to reach all segments of the population in the communities served by the employment unit 
in addition  station employment units must undertake a set number of non vacancy specific outreach initiatives normally every two years from an fcc menu of outreach initiatives  including  for example  meaningful participation in job fairs  internships or scholarship programs 
station employment units subject to these recruitment and outreach requirements must retain various records of their efforts and place in their public inspection files  annually  an eeo public file report posting an electronic version on their internet websites 
radio station employment units with more than full time employees generally must file certain of their annual eeo public file reports with the fcc midway through their license term 
the fcc is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part time employment positions 
from time to time  complaints may be filed against radio one s radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules 
in addition  the fcc may conduct audits or inspections to ensure and verify licensee compliance with fcc rules and regulations 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including fines or conditions  the grant of short less than the maximum eight year renewal terms or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license

item legal proceedings in november  radio one and certain of its officers and directors were named as defendants in a class action shareholder complaint filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  now captioned  in re radio one  inc initial public offering securities litigation  case no 
cv similar complaints were filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies issuers that conducted initial public offerings of their common stock in the late s the ipo lawsuits 
in the complaint filed against radio one as amended  the plaintiffs claim that radio one  certain of its officers and directors  and the underwriters of certain of its public offerings violated section of the securities act of based on allegations that its registration statement and prospectus failed to disclose material facts regarding the compensation to be received by  and the stock allocation practices of  the underwriters 
the complaint also contains a claim for violation of section b of the securities exchange act of based on allegations that this omission constituted a deceit on investors 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
in july  radio one joined in a global motion  filed by the issuers  to dismiss the ipo lawsuits 
in october  the court entered an order dismissing the company s named officers and directors from the ipo lawsuits without prejudice  pursuant to an agreement tolling the statute of limitations with respect to radio one s officers and directors until september  in february  the court issued a decision denying the motion to dismiss the section and section b claims against radio one and most of the issuers 

table of contents in july  a special litigation committee of radio one s board of directors approved in principle a settlement proposal with the plaintiffs that is anticipated to include most of the issuers 
the proposed settlement would provide for the dismissal with prejudice of all claims against the participating issuers and their officers and the assignment to plaintiffs of certain potential claims that the issuers may have against their underwriters 
the tentative settlement also provides that  in the event that plaintiffs ultimately recover less than a guaranteed sum from the underwriters  plaintiffs would be entitled to payment by each participating issuer s insurer of a pro rata share of any shortfall in the plaintiffs guaranteed recovery 
in september  in connection with the proposed settlement  radio one s named officers and directors extended the tolling agreement so that it would not expire prior to any settlement being finalized 
in june  radio one executed a final settlement agreement with the plaintiffs 
on february   the court issued a decision certifying a class action for settlement purposes and granting preliminary approval of the settlement subject to modification of certain bar orders contemplated by the settlement 
in addition  the settlement is still subject to statutory notice requirements as well as final judicial approval

executive summary our net broadcast revenue growth continued to outperform our industry in radio one grew its net broadcast revenue approximately for the year versus industry growth in our markets of under 
our success was fairly widespread  with of our markets outperforming the industry 
during the year  we acquired stick stations in houston  philadelphia and charlotte that were either significantly underutilized or which we relocated closer to urban areas of the market 
these acquisitions should provide us with an opportunity to sustain a growth rate above that of the radio industry 
in general  was another year of relatively slow growth for the radio industry  continuing a trend that has affected the industry since the attacks of and the events that followed most notably  the recent recession and iraq war 
among other challenges  the radio industry faces increased competition from a number of technologies affecting the daily lives of consumers  including the continued growth in internet usage  the increase in the number of subscribers to satellite radio and the overwhelming popularity of ipods and other digital audio recording and listening devices 
terrestrial radio now faces more competition for the time and attention of consumers than at any other point in history 
to address these challenges  the industry is working cooperatively on a number of initiatives to enhance the value of radio  including reducing the number of commercial minutes played each hour in an effort to enhance the quality of programming for listeners and implementing new technology that will allow terrestrial radio to broadcast compact disc like quality to listeners 
in addition to strengthening our core radio broadcast business through strategic acquisitions and effective cost management  we have been opportunistically investing in and developing complementary businesses 
we believe that such investments will enhance our ability to reach the african american consumer through targeted content and alternate distribution channels 
for example  in january  we and comcast corporation launched tv one and  in late  we announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in reach media  the programming vehicle for tom joyner  the leading african american radio personality 
although it is still too early to determine the impact that these investments and efforts will have on our results  we believe that they represent important milestones toward the achievement of our goal of becoming the most attractive and efficient medium for advertisers to reach african american consumers 
we are cautiously optimistic about our outlook for we will be prudent in our analysis of new radio station acquisition opportunities and will take appropriate steps to manage our balance sheet to provide us with the lowest cost of capital and highest level of financial flexibility that we deem prudent 
introduction revenue we derive revenue from sales of advertisements and program sponsorships on our stations to local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  tower rental income  independent promotion agreements  ticket and other revenue related to special events we sponsor throughout the year and  beginning in  management fees from tv one net broadcast revenue 
advertising revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market 
these rates are largely based upon a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  the number of radio stations in the related market  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours 
our advertising revenue is primarily driven by local advertising 
in  approximately of our advertising revenue was generated from local advertising and was generated from national advertising  including network advertising 
the balance of revenue was generated primarily from tower rental income  ticket sales and revenue related to our sponsored events and other revenues 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue from our spot inventory  we minimize the use of trade and barter agreements 
expenses our significant broadcast expenses are i employee salaries and commissions  ii programming expenses  iii advertising and promotion expenses  iv rental of premises for studios  v rental of transmission tower space and vi music license royalty fees 
we strive to control these expenses by centralizing certain functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems and the overall programming management function 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase our audiences 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any changed ratings and therefore the effects on advertising revenues tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenditures 

table of contents measurement of performance we monitor the growth and operational results of our business using net income and the following key metrics a net broadcast revenue the performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily measured by its ability to generate net broadcast revenue 
net broadcast revenue consists of gross broadcast revenue net of local and national agency commissions  consistent with industry practice 
net broadcast revenue is recognized in the period in which advertisements are broadcast

b station operating income net income or loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  change in accounting principle  depreciation and amortization  equity in net loss of affiliated company  other expense  corporate expenses and non cash compensation expenses is commonly referred to in our business as station operating income 
station operating income is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
nevertheless we believe station operating income is often a useful measure of a broadcasting company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our stations within the various markets because station operating income provides helpful information about our results of operations apart from expenses associated with our physical plant  income tax provision or benefit  investments  debt financings  overhead and non cash compensation 
station operating income is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of station operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
station operating income does not purport to represent operating loss or cash flow from operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance

d ebitda net income or loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles

ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net broadcast revenue  partially offset by higher operating expenses as described above 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda is provided on page liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and  to the extent necessary  commitments available under our amended and restated bank credit facility and other debt or equity financings 
we have used  and will continue to use  a significant portion of our capital resources to consummate acquisitions 
these acquisitions were or may be funded with our bank credit facility  and or the proceeds of future common and or preferred stock  and or debt offerings  and or internally generated cash flow 
we entered into an amended and restated bank credit facility as of july  under the credit facility  we have borrowed million in term loans and may borrow up to million on a revolving basis  subject to applicable covenant restrictions 
historically  we have drawn down funds from the credit facility as capital was required  primarily for acquisitions 
as of december   we have repaid million of the term loans  leaving an outstanding balance of million 
as of december  we had drawn down million to complete the acquisition of kroi fm formerly krts fm  and million to complete the acquisition of the outstanding stock of new mableton broadcasting corporation  resulting in our being able to borrow up to an additional million on a revolving basis  subject to the applicable covenant restrictions 
in february  in connection with the redemption of our high tides  we drew down an additional million under the revolver 
both the term loan and the revolving commitment under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either libor plus a spread that ranges from to or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
under the bank credit facility  we are required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations using interest rate hedge agreements 
as a result  we have entered into various fixed rate swap agreements designed to mitigate our exposure to higher floating interest rates 
these swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and that the bank pays to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
we currently have swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million 
as of december   the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from to months 
our credit exposure under these swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
all of the swap agreements are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these swap agreements is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation

such terms also place restrictions on us with respect to the sale of assets  liens  investments  dividends  debt repayments  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates  consolidation and mergers  and the issuance of equity interests  among other things 
our credit facility also requires compliance with financial tests based on financial position and results of operations  including a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  all of which could effectively limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility or to otherwise raise funds in the debt market 
in january  we entered into an amendment with our lenders under our bank facility that modified the financial condition covenants to terms that enabled us to complete a private placement of million of senior subordinated notes due february and also fully redeem our high tides

we continuously review opportunities to acquire additional radio stations  primarily in the top african american markets  and to make strategic investments 
as of the date of this report  other than our agreement with an affiliate of comcast corporation  directv and other investors to fund tv one the balance of our commitment is million at december   we have no definitive agreements to make acquisitions of additional radio stations or to make strategic investments 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions and strategic investments will be financed through funds generated from operations  cash on hand  equity financings  permitted debt financings  debt financings through unrestricted subsidiaries or a combination of these sources 
however  there can be no assurance that financing from any of these sources  if available  will be available on favorable terms

in may  we completed the private placement of million of senior subordinated notes due  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay amounts owed on our bank credit facility and previously outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in february  we completed the private placement of million of senior subordinated notes due february  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the notes  together with million drawdown under our bank credit facility and available excess cash  was used to redeem approximately million of our high tides 
in connection with these transactions  we amended our senior bank facility to enable us to complete the notes offering and the high tides redemption 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt  and our ability to refinance the senior subordinated notes at or prior to their scheduled maturity date in  and our ability to refinance the senior subordinated notes at or prior to their scheduled maturity date in will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
during  in addition to scheduled principal repayments of our term loans of million  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital  continued business development  strategic investment opportunities and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated internal growth  for the foreseeable future  cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to make required payments of interest on our indebtedness  to fulfill our commitment to fund tv one  to fund potential acquisitions  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to enable us to comply with the terms of our debt agreements 
however  in order to finance future acquisitions or investments  if any  we may require additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
credit rating agencies on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt 
as a result of their reviews  our credit rating could change 
we believe that any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity 
the effect of a change in our credit rating may limit or eliminate our ability to obtain debt financing  or include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future bank facilities  notes or other types of debt

sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
topic d prohibits the use of the residual method for all assets acquired in a business combination completed after september  further  companies that have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing should perform an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  we have determined that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements

sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt our requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
r  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation plan as permitted by statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allows us to follow apb no 
and recognize no compensation cost for options granted to employees at fair market value 
we have computed  for pro forma disclosure purposes  the value of all compensatory options granted during and  using the black scholes option pricing model 
options were assumed to be exercised upon vesting for the purpose of this valuation 
adjustments were also made for options assumed forfeited prior to vesting 
goodwill and fcc licenses we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill  fcc licenses  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions using the direct value method  in which all assets are directly valued through the receipt of an independent third party appraisal 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
prior to january   goodwill and fcc licenses were amortized over a year period excluding the assets acquired from blue chip broadcasting  inc and sinclair telecable  inc  which were purchased after june  
commencing january   goodwill and fcc licenses are not amortized  but are tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
in determining the realizability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we value fcc licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis prepared by an independent third party valuation expert 
goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of a station s net assets over its carrying value 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the amount determined by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the recorded value of goodwill exceeds its implied value  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of fcc licenses and goodwill  which are considered indefinite lived assets and are subject to an annual impairment test 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and fcc licenses long lived assets  excluding goodwill and fcc licenses  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we will evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if the assets are impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in an agency s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount

generally  clients remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits the gross billing  less their commission  to us 
equity accounting we account for our investment in tv one under the equity method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  and other related interpretations 
we have recorded our investment at cost and have adjusted the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the change in radio one s claim on the net assets of tv one resulting from losses of tv one as well as other capital transactions of tv one using a hypothetical liquidation at book value approach 
we will review the realizability of the investment if conditions are present or events occur to suggest that an impairment of the investment may exist 
we have determined that although tv one is a variable interest entity as defined by financial accounting standards board interpretation no

table of contents contingencies and litigation we regularly evaluate our exposure relating to any contingencies or litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss  or are probable but for which an estimate of the liability is not currently available 
estimation of effective tax rates we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
in addition  we consider the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining if a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
our estimate of our effective tax rates has not changed significantly in the past year  with rates that ranged from to 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rates as of december   would result in an increase in income tax expense of million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense would result in a decrease in net income of million to million from million reducing net income per share diluted by to for the year ended december  impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
seasonality several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
capital and commercial commitments long term debt we have raised funds from the following issuances of long term debt in july  we established various credit facilities under an agreement with a group of financial institutions whereby we may borrow up to million 
this agreement was subsequently amended on march  the amended and restated credit agreement to provide a new facility under which we may borrow up to million 
in may  we completed a private placement of million of our senior subordinated notes due  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay amounts owed on our bank credit facility and previously outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in february  we completed a private placement of million of our senior subordinated notes due  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds of the offering  together with a drawdown of million under our bank credit facility and available excess cash  was used to redeem approximately million of our high tides 

table of contents the bank credit facility consists of term a loans loan in an amount up to million  and a credit line revolver in an amount up to million that may be borrowed on a revolving basis 
the interest rate on the bank credit facility is libor plus a spread based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility requires quarterly interest payments 
the credit facility also requires minimum quarterly principal payments  which commenced march  the loans mature in june as of december   we had million outstanding on the loan and million remained available subject to various covenant restrictions to be drawn under the revolver 
lease obligations we have non cancelable operating leases for office space  studio space  broadcast towers and transmitter facilities and non cancelable capital leases for equipment that expire over the next twenty years 
contractual obligations schedule the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations and beyond total senior subordinated notes bank credit facility capital lease obligations dividends on preferred stock other operating contracts agreements operating lease obligations total the above amounts do not include interest  which in some cases is variable in amount 
in february  in connection with the redemption of our high tides  we drew down an additional million under our bank credit facility 
in february   we redeemed all outstanding high tides using proceeds from our sale of million senior subordinated notes  borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and available excess cash 
following this redemption  no dividends are payable on the preferred stock 
other operating contracts agreements include employment contracts  severance obligations  on air talent contracts and other programming agreements 
we anticipate that we will fund our obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations and future borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  other than as follows we utilize letters of credit in connection with our annual insurance policy renewals 
during the year ended december   we obtained two standby letters of credit in the amounts of  and  in connection with our annual insurance policy renewals 
in december  we obtained a new standby letter of credit in the amount of  to replace the letter of credit of  accordingly  as of december   we had two standby letters of credit in the amounts of  and  to date  there has been no further activity on these standby letters of credit 
the total outstanding letters of credit of  of december  were immaterial 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million to hedge our variable rate debt 
the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from to months 
if we terminate our interest swap agreements before they expire  we will be required to pay early termination fees 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 

table of contents we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
risk factors our future operating results could be adversely affected by a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations 
if any of the risks described below actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
decreased spending by advertisers can adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales of advertisements and program sponsorships on our stations to local and national advertisers 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
as a result  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
we may lose audience share and advertising revenue to competing radio stations or other types of media competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and station groups  as well as with other media such as broadcast television  newspapers  magazines  cable television  satellite television  satellite radio  outdoor advertising  the internet and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change 
any adverse change in a particular market  or adverse change in the relative market positions of the stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on our revenue or ratings  could require increased promotion or other expenses in that market  and could adversely affect our revenue in other markets 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenue 
in addition  from time to time  other stations may change their format or programming  a new station may adopt a format to compete directly with our stations for audiences and advertisers  or stations might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns 
these tactics could result in lower ratings and advertising revenue or increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower earnings and cash flow for us 
audience preferences as to format or programming may also shift due to demographic or other reasons 
any failure by us to respond  or to respond as quickly as our competitors  could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards which characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies  which may impact our business 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies are being  or have been  developed  including the following satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  and digital audio and video content available for listening and or viewing on the internet and or available to be downloaded to portable devices 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt effectively to these new media technologies 
the loss of key personnel  including on air talent  could disrupt the management and operations of our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief operating officer and chief administrative officer  and other key employees  including on air personalities 
we believe that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by our executive officers would be 
table of contents difficult to replace  and that the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on us  including the impairment of our ability to execute our business strategy 
additionally  we employ or independently contract with several on air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas 
these on air personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a station  and thus  the ability of the station to sell advertising 
we cannot be assured that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current audiences 
our acquisition strategy could be hampered by a lack of attractive opportunities or other risks associated with integrating the operations  systems and management of the radio stations we acquire 
our acquisition strategy depends significantly on our ability to identify underperforming radio stations or stick stations in attractive markets  to purchase such stations at a reasonable cost and to increase revenue  cash flow and ratings from such radio stations 
some of the material risks that could hinder our ability to implement this strategy include increases in prices for radio stations due to increased competition for acquisition opportunities  reduction in the number of suitable acquisition targets  failure or unanticipated delays in completing acquisitions due to difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approval  including possible difficulties in obtaining antitrust approval for acquisitions in markets where we already own multiple stations or potential delays resulting from the uncertainty arising from legal challenges to the fcc s adoption of new broadcast ownership rules  difficulty in integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of radio stations  failure of some acquisitions to prove profitable or generate sufficient cash flow  issuance of large amounts of common stock in order to purchase radio stations  need to finance acquisitions through funding from the credit or capital markets  and inability to finance acquisitions on acceptable terms 
our business depends on maintaining our licenses with the fcc 
we could be prevented from operating a radio station if we fail to maintain its license 
radio broadcasters depend upon maintaining radio broadcasting licenses issued by the fcc 
these licenses are ordinarily issued for a maximum term of eight years and are renewable 
our radio broadcasting licenses expire at various times through october  although we may apply to renew our fcc licenses  interested third parties may challenge our renewal applications 
in addition  we are subject to extensive and changing regulation by the fcc with respect to such matters as programming  indecency standards  technical operations  employment and business practices 
if we or any of our significant stockholders  officers  or directors violate the fcc s rules and regulations or the communications act of  or is convicted of a felony  the fcc may commence a proceeding to impose fines or sanctions upon us 
examples of possible sanctions include the imposition of fines  the renewal of one or more of our broadcasting licenses for a term of fewer than eight years or the revocation of our broadcast licenses 
if the fcc were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license  we would be required to cease operating the radio station covered by the license only after we had exhausted administrative and judicial review without success 
there is significant uncertainty regarding the fcc s media ownership rules  and such rules could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation 
among other things  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own directly or by attribution in any market and require fcc approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses 
in june  the fcc issued a media ownership decision which substantially altered its television  radio and cross media ownership restrictions the rules or new rules 
the fcc s media ownership restrictions apply to parties that hold attributable interests in broadcast station licensees 
with respect to radio  the rules  among other things  a retained the pre existing numerical limits on the permissible number of radio stations in fcc defined local radio markets in which a party may co own or have an attributable interest  b redefined local radio markets to rely on arbitron metro survey areas arbitron metros in portions of the country where they exist in place of the contour overlap methodology previously used  c grandfathered existing local radio combinations that conflict with the new rules based on the arbitron metro definition of local radio markets until the combination is sold  d provided that a contract to sell more than per week of the advertising time on another in market radio station joint sales agreement or jsa constitutes an attributable interest  and e replaced radio tv and daily newspaper broadcast cross ownership rules with a more relaxed single set of new cross media ownership restrictions 
in addition  the fcc instituted a rulemaking to determine how to define local radio markets in areas outside arbitron metros 
the rules were challenged in court 
the challenges were consolidated before the us court of appeals for the third circuit  which initially issued a stay of the new rules before they became effective and subsequently remanded many of them to the 
table of contents fcc for further proceedings  keeping the judicial stay in place 
as a result  the fcc continued to apply the rules in effect before the stay 
the fcc also filed a petition to partially lift the judicial stay as it relates to the new local radio ownership restrictions 
the third circuit lifted the stay as it relates to the fcc s decision to i make jsas an attributable interest  ii define local radio markets based on arbitron metros  and iii grandfather certain local radio combinations only until the combination is sold 
the court declined to lift the stay as to matters pertaining to numerical limits on local radio ownership and the am subcap 
in response  the fcc revised its application forms for transfers of control and assignments of licenses to incorporate these aspects of the new rules  and the fcc is now applying such revisions to all pending and new applications 
the fcc s media ownership rules remain in flux and subject to further agency and court proceedings 
certain of the parties to the third circuit s decision have requested review by the us supreme court  which request remains pending 
at the fcc  the new rules are currently on remand from the third circuit and the fcc has not yet instituted further proceedings 
also  the fcc has not yet ruled on pending petitions for reconsideration of the decision adopting the rules 
in addition to the fcc media ownership rules  the outside media interests of our officers and directors could limit our ability to acquire stations 
the filing of petitions or complaints against radio one or any fcc licensee from which we are acquiring a station could result in the fcc delaying the grant of  or refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses 
the communications act and fcc rules and policies also impose limitations on non us ownership and voting of our capital stock 
increased enforcement by fcc of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry 
the fcc has recently indicated that it is enhancing its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a serious indecency violation 
legislation that passed in the house and will be offered in the senate would dramatically increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming and potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
in addition  the fcc s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme  against the broadcast industry generally  may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations 
two common stockholders have a majority voting interest in radio one and have the power to control matters on which our common stockholders may vote  and their interests may conflict with yours 
as of december   our chairperson and her son  our president and chief executive officer ceo  collectively held approximately of the outstanding voting power of our common stock 
as a result  our chairperson and the ceo will control most decisions involving us  including transactions involving a change of control  such as a sale or merger 
in addition  certain covenants in our debt instruments require that our chairperson and the ceo maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in us  and prohibit other parties voting interests from exceeding specified amounts 
in addition  the tv one operating agreement provides for adverse consequences to radio one in the event our chairperson and ceo fail to maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in us 
our chairperson and the ceo have agreed to vote their shares together in elections of members of the board of directors 
we must replace or modify our existing credit agreement by june  under our existing credit agreement as amended in january  we must maintain a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda as calculated in accordance with our existing credit agreement of no more than to through june  thereafter  our ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda may not exceed to as of december   after giving pro forma effect to i the consummation of the mableton acquisition and the wabz fm acquisition  ii the consummation of the offering of our senior subordinated notes  iii the redemption of the high tides  and iv the drawdown of an additional million under our bank credit facility our ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda would be approximately to  which would exceed the maximum ratio of to that will be permitted as of june  if  as of june   our ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda were to exceed the maximum ratio permitted under the existing credit agreement  we would be in breach of the covenant relating to such ratio and we could be required to seek a waiver or further amendment of such covenant 
we cannot assure you that such waivers or further amendments could be obtained  or  if obtained  that they would be on terms acceptable to us 
if we were unable to obtain such waivers or further amendments  the lenders under the credit agreement could declare all amounts outstanding under such agreement to be immediately due and payable and such lenders could proceed against any or all of the collateral securing such borrowings 
in addition  in certain circumstances such breach or acceleration of amounts due under our credit agreement would cause a default under our senior subordinated notes and under our senior subordinated notes 
we intend to replace our existing bank credit facility with a new bank credit facility to  among other things  increase our borrowing capacity  change certain covenants under our current credit agreement including the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda and reduce our near and intermediate term debt amortization requirement 
while we anticipate completing such replacement facility by june   there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so  or that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us 
our substantial level of debt could limit our ability to grow and compete 
as of december   we had indebtedness of million and were permitted to borrow up to an additional million under our existing bank credit facility 
we may reborrow under our revolving credit facility as needed to fund our working capital needs  for general corporate purposes and to fund permitted acquisitions and investments 
a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect us for various reasons  including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt payments or other corporate purposes  
table of contents have sufficient funds available for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes  compete with competitors that have less debt than we do  and react to changing market conditions  changes in our industry and economic downturns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk both the revolving commitment and term loan borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either libor plus a spread that ranges from to or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
under the bank credit facility  we are required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations using interest rate hedge agreements 
we have entered into various fixed rate swap agreements designed to mitigate our exposure to higher floating interest rates 
these swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and that bank pay to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of december   we had swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million 
the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from to months 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
all of the swap agreements are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these swap agreements is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation
