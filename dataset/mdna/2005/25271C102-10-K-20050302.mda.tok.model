item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
overview results of operations and industry conditions the overall market for the company s mid water and deepwater semisubmersible rigs improved dramatically beginning in the third quarter of and extending into the increase in demand  which resulted from a combination of customer recognition of high oil and gas prices  increasing oil consumption and declining reserves  among other things  lifted dayrates around the world  but had the greatest impact in the us gulf of mexico and the north sea two markets where the company has a significant presence 
the company s jack up fleet also experienced steady growth in utilization and dayrates throughout improving markets gulf of mexico 
in the us gulf of mexico  commitments for diamond offshore s high specification rigs have reached as high as  per day for work beginning in mid and extending into the first quarter of this contrasts with dayrates in the  range earned during the first half of all six of the company s high specification semisubmersible rigs in the us gom are currently contracted with backlogs extending at least until the third quarter of at progressively higher dayrates than previous contracts 
in addition  the dayrate for the company s four mid water semisubmersibles operating in the gom has reached as high as  for work beginning in early september  with backlog also building in this market at improving dayrates 
this contrasts with dayrates in the  range earned during the first half of the improving dayrates and high committed utilization were factors in the company s decision to reactivate the previously cold stacked ocean voyager for the mid water us gom market 
the ocean voyager  which resumed work in mid december  is earning a dayrate of  as of the date of this report and has future commitments to work at dayrates ranging from  to  beginning in the second quarter of the company views the deepwater and mid water markets in the gom as under supplied  and believes that additional improvement in utilization  backlog and dayrates is likely in these market segments during the company s jack up fleet in the gom also continued to experience high utilization and improving dayrates during and into early the company views the jack up market in the us gom as currently tightly balanced  with effective utilization near percent and demand sporadically exceeding supply 
as a result  the company believes the market and dayrates for this class of equipment could improve further in the near term 
in the mexican gom  the company s four semisubmersible rigs that mobilized to that market in the latter half of continued to operate throughout under long term contracts and remain contracted for that market throughout the company believes that future work for other of its semisubmersibles and jack ups in this market is limited 
the company views the market for the mexican gom as in balance and expects it to remain so this year 
brazil 
two of the company s four rigs operating in brazil  one of which is a high specification semisubmersible  have contracts that expire in the third quarter of these units were contracted prior to the mid year market improvement and the company will seek to obtain new contracts for these rigs reflective of market conditions 
the company views the brazilian semisubmersible market as firm and expects it to remain so during north sea 
drilling activity in the north sea mirrored that in the gulf of mexico in demand and pricing accelerated in the second half of  and utilization of marketed semisubmersible rigs in the uk sector of the north sea reached percent by the end of june the ocean guardian and ocean princess  which began the year earning dayrates between  and  each received one year extensions to their contracts in the uk at  per day 
the ocean vanguard began work at mid year in 
table of contents the uk sector for a start up rate of  per day 
the unit then mobilized to norway late in  where it began an approximately month series of contracts for a dayrate in the low  s 
also responding to the strong demand in the north sea  the ocean nomad returned to the uk from west africa and is operating under a one year contract  also at  per day 
effective utilization of marketed semisubmersible rigs in both the u 
k and norwegian sectors of the north sea remains at percent  and the company believes this market will remain firm throughout the balance of in february  the company reached an agreement with a customer to upgrade the ocean guardian to high pressure  high temperature capabilities 
the upgrade is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of and is estimated to cost approximately million  which will be paid by the customer  in part by a lump sum payment of million with the remainder to be recovered through dayrate increases over a minimum of days 
southeast asia 
the company s two high specification semisubmersibles operating in southeast asia received new contracts in the first quarter of the ocean baroness was awarded a one year contract at a dayrate of approximately  for work in the gulf of mexico beginning early in the fourth quarter of the unit is expected to begin a day mobilization back to the us at the conclusion of its current contract in may additionally  the ocean rover received a day extension to its current contract at a dayrate averaging in the mid  s 
the new dayrates contrast with rates in the mid  s and mid  s  respectively  for the rigs previous contracts 
all of the company s other semisubmersible rigs in the southeast asian market currently have contracts or commitments for work extending at least into mid at favorable market dayrates 
the company views demand in the southeast asian market as increasing  and with high utilization  the company believes dayrates could continue improving 
general revenues 
the company s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  the company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  the company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
the two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs  and vice versa 
the same factors  primarily demand for drilling services  which is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development as well as a variety of political and economic factors  and availability of rigs in a particular geographical region  affect both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within the company s control and are difficult to predict 
revenue from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  the company may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment 
these fees are earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
the company previously accounted for the excess of mobilization fees received over costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another as revenue over the term of the related drilling contracts 
effective july  the company changed its accounting to defer mobilization fees received as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred and began to amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
if the company had used this method of accounting in prior periods  operating income loss and net income loss would not have changed and the impact on contract drilling revenues and expenses would have been immaterial 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 

table of contents reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of the company s customers in accordance with a contract or agreement are recorded for the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met 
income is recognized on the completed contract method 
provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract 
the company has elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services  which includes turnkey contracts  except in very limited circumstances 
operating income 
operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  the company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  the company may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
the company recognizes  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and  which maintain rather than upgrade its rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
operating income is negatively impacted when the company performs certain regulatory inspections year surveys that are due every five years for all of the company s rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled down time in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory down time 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are included in note of its notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates are inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements and the application of its significant accounting policies 
the company believes that its most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
drilling and other property and equipment is carried at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
the offshore drilling industry is a relatively young industry which began developing just over years ago 
the company has based its estimates of useful lives and salvage values on the historical industry data available to it as well as its own experience 
in april the company commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of its drilling rigs because several of its rigs had reached or were approaching the end of their depreciable lives  yet were still operating and were expected to operate for many more years 
as a result of this study  effective april   the company recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated service lives to years for jack ups and years for semisubmersibles and the company s drillship and by increasing salvage values to for most of the company s drilling rigs 
the change in estimate was 
table of contents made to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of the company s fleet 
the effect of this change in accounting estimate resulted in a reduction to the company s net loss for the years ended december  and of million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively 
the company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company utilizes a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
the assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include a dayrate by rig  b utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  c the per day operating cost for each rig if active  ready stacked or cold stacked and d salvage value for each rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates a matrix is developed assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates 
the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant  or alternatively the impact of a reduction in utilization again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant is also considered as part of this analysis 
at december   the company considered its three cold stacked rigs for impairment testing and determined that none of the drilling units was impaired 
on january   the company announced that one of its cold stacked rigs  the ocean endeavor  would be upgraded to a high specification drilling unit for an estimated cost of million 
as a result of this decision and the low net book value of this rig  the company does not consider this asset to be impaired 
at december   the company had elected to market one of its cold stacked rigs  the ocean liberator  for sale to a third party and classified the rig as an asset held for sale in the company s consolidated balance sheet included in item of this report 
the estimated market value of this rig  based on offers from third parties  is higher than its current carrying value  therefore  no write down was deemed necessary as a result of the reclassification to held for sale 
the remaining cold stacked rig was evaluated for impairment using the probability weighted cash flow analysis discussed above 
at december  the probability weighted cash flow for the ocean new era significantly exceeded its net carrying value of million 
at december  the company determined that all five of its cold stacked rigs should be tested for impairment 
the impairment analysis at december  consisted of a probability weighted cash flow analysis for each of the five cold stacked rigs 
in all cases  the probability weighted cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value of each rig 
two of the company s cold stacked rigs that were tested and found not to be impaired at december  were subsequently reactivated and these rigs currently have contracted dayrates that are within the range of dayrates used in the company s impairment analysis 
management s assumptions are an inherent part of an asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
the company s uninsured retention of liability for personal injury claims  which primarily results from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  is million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of million 
the company s in house claims department estimates the amount of its liability for its retention 
this department establishes a reserve for each of the company s personal injury claims by evaluating the existing facts and circumstances of each claim and comparing the circumstances of each claim to historical experiences with similar past personal injury claims 
the claims department also estimates the company s liability for claims which are incurred but not reported by using historical data 
historically  the company s ultimate liability for personal injury claims has not differed materially from the company s recorded estimates 
at december  the company s estimated liability for personal injury claims was million 
due to uncertainties such as a the severity of personal injuries claimed  b significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  c the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  d inconsistent court decisions and e the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation  eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from the estimated amounts 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of 
table of contents the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in its financial statements or tax returns 
in each of its tax jurisdictions the company recognizes a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
for interim periods  the company estimates its annual effective tax rate by forecasting its annual income before income tax  taxable income and tax expense in each of its tax jurisdictions 
the company makes judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of the company s effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
certain of the company s foreign tax credit carryforwards are scheduled to expire in although the company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards  under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the company determined that a valuation allowance was necessary 
in december the company established a valuation allowance of million  which resulted in a charge against earnings 
at december   the company s valuation allowance related to the potential realization of deferred tax assets was million

revenues 
revenues from high specification floaters decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the same period in 
table of contents utilization fell to during from in excluding the ocean rover and negatively impacted revenue by million 
each of the following rigs operated during all or most of but their utilization in declined primarily due to the ocean alliance  which was off contract for most of the first half of  including four months of downtime due to a series of sub sea and electrical problems following approximately one month in a shipyard for a year survey and sub sea equipment upgrade  the ocean star  which was ready stacked during the first five months of the ocean confidence  which had approximately three more weeks of unpaid downtime in than in  for sub sea repairs and an inspection in  and the ocean america  which spent days in a shipyard undergoing a year survey and upgrade which were completed late in the second quarter of partially offsetting the overall decline in utilization were improvements in utilization from the ocean valiant  which operated all of  compared to  when this rig was in a shipyard for approximately three months for a year survey and scheduled maintenance 
lower overall average operating dayrates in  as compared to  resulted in a million reduction in revenue 
average operating dayrates fell to  during from  during excluding the ocean rover 
the lower average dayrates in were primarily the result of soft market conditions in the us gom in the first half of as several of these high specification floaters accepted jobs in the mid water depth market 
the unfavorable revenue variance for high specification rigs in compared to was also partially offset by million in additional revenue in contributed by the ocean rover as it continued its drilling program offshore malaysia 
this rig commenced drilling operations in july after completion of its upgrade to high specification capabilities which began in contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for high specification floaters for the year ended december  increased million compared to the same period in higher contract drilling expenses were primarily due to operating costs for the ocean rover  which worked all of compared to  when most of this rig s costs were capitalized in connection with its upgrade  costs for repairs to the ocean alliance due to a series of sub sea and electrical problems and a year survey  and costs associated with damages from hurricane ivan to the ocean america and ocean star during the latter half of partially offsetting the overall higher contract drilling expenses during were lower expenses for the ocean valiant  which incurred higher costs during for a year survey and maintenance repairs

this rig began operation for pemex in the mexican gom in the mid fourth quarter of and remained under contract throughout these utilization improvements were partially offset by a decline in utilization for the ocean concord  which was stacked for six months in for a year survey and various repairs 
the rig then entered a shipyard for life enhancement maintenance  as compared to when it worked most of the year 
the average operating dayrate for other semisubmersibles fell from  during excluding the ocean vanguard to  during  reducing revenues by million 
the most significant reductions in average operating dayrates were to the ocean yatzy from  to  which renewed its contract to operate offshore brazil during the latter part of at a lower dayrate reflective of market conditions at the time  and the ocean yorktown from  to  which worked offshore brazil during the first half of but operated in the mexican gom during partially offsetting the overall lower average operating dayrates was an improvement in the average operating dayrate for the ocean worker from  to 
the ocean worker operated in the mexican gom throughout in the rig operated in the us gom for seven months at a lower average dayrate before moving to the mexican gom 
revenues for the ocean vanguard improved million in compared to due to a higher average operating dayrate in this semisubmersible rig had an average operating dayrate of  during  compared to  in which was earned under a bareboat charter 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles increased million during  as compared to  primarily due to the ocean vanguard  which incurred higher operating expenses during compared to when the rig operated under a bareboat charter to its previous owner at reduced operating costs  including costs associated with preparing the rig for work in the north sea  the ocean voyager  which was reactivated from cold stack status during the fourth quarter of  higher operating expenses associated with rigs working in the mexican gom throughout  including additional equipment rental expense in connection with the rigs contracts with pemex  travel costs and costs associated with maintaining a mexican shorebase  as compared to when two of these rigs operated in the us gom  and another rig was stacked in africa for the first five months of the year  the ocean epoch  which incurred normal operating costs as it worked most of compared to reduced costs while it was ready stacked during most of  the ocean patriot  which incurred higher than normal operating costs during due to preparation for work in new zealand and australia  including mobilization of the rig from south africa  compared to normal operating costs during the same period in following its march purchase  and the ocean guardian and ocean princess  both of which incurred higher labor costs in associated with mandated labor benefits legislated in the uk 
table of contents partially offsetting the increase in contract drilling expense in were lower costs compared to due to lower year survey  inspection and repair costs for the ocean bounty  ocean guardian and ocean princess in compared to  and mobilization costs in associated with the four rigs operating in the mexican gom 
jack ups 
revenues 
revenues from jack ups increased million during compared to the average operating dayrate for jack ups rose to  in from  in resulting in a million improvement in revenues 
all of the company s jack ups in the gom experienced an increase in average dayrate primarily due to a tighter market for this class of equipment in the us gom 
utilization rose to during from during  resulting in a million increase in revenue 
significant increases in utilization were primarily due to the ocean tower and ocean titan in the us gom  and the ocean sovereign in southeast asia  which were in shipyards undergoing major upgrades during a significant portion of  but were operating during most of utilization for these rigs increased to in compared to in  the ocean champion  which was reactivated from cold stack status during  and the ocean heritage  ocean summit  ocean spartan  ocean columbia and ocean drake  all of which worked a majority of compared to each being stacked for periods ranging from two to five months in utilization for these five rigs increased to in as compared to in partially offsetting the improvement in utilization was the ocean nugget  which was stacked for almost two months during for a spud can inspection and related repair work compared to working most of  and the ocean warwick  which was in a shipyard for all of the fourth quarter of undergoing repairs to damages caused by hurricane ivan  compared to working most of in addition  revenues in included million related to the amortization of lump sum mobilization fees 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for jack ups during increased million from primarily due to higher operating and mobilization costs for the ocean heritage during  compared to reduced expenses during while this rig was stacked in a singapore shipyard for six months  higher operating costs for the ocean sovereign  which was working in compared to when a majority of expenditures were capitalized as part of its upgrade  reactivation and operating costs for the ocean champion  compared to cold stack costs during  and operating costs for the ocean titan during  compared to when most of this rig s costs were capitalized in connection with its cantilever upgrade

revenues related to reimbursable items  offset by the related expenditures for these items  were million in compared to million in reimbursable expenses include items that the company purchases  and or services it performs  at the request of its customers 
the company charges its customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost  plus a mark up where applicable 
therefore  net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements which vary 
depreciation 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million in  primarily due to additional depreciation expense associated with the ocean rover  which completed its upgrade in july  the ocean patriot  acquired in march  upgrades to three jack up rigs  two of which were completed during the second quarter of and one which was completed in early  and capital expenditures in the third quarter related to contracts for four of the company s rigs in mexico 
partially offsetting the increases noted above was higher depreciation expense of million during the first quarter of prior to the company s adjustment of the estimated service lives and salvage values for most of its drilling rigs  effective april   to better reflect their remaining economic lives and salvage values 
see critical accounting estimates 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for of million increased million  as compared to million for this increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs  costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  higher external audit fees and higher net building expenses due to lower rental income from tenants 
loss on sale and disposition of assets 
the million loss on the sale and disposition of assets in primarily related to the write off of equipment that was lost during hurricane ivan 
the loss on the sale and disposition of assets of million during primarily related to the sale of two of the company s semisubmersible drilling rigs  the ocean century and ocean prospector 
these rigs  which had been cold stacked since july and october  respectively  were permanently retired from service as offshore drilling rigs and written down by million to their fair market values in september and subsequently sold for  each pre tax in december interest expense 
interest expense of million in was million higher than interest expense of million in primarily due to interest on the senior notes issued august  and lower interest expense in as a result of interest capitalized relating to the upgrade of the ocean rover which was completed in july see note general information capitalized interest and note long term debt in item of this report

income tax expense benefit 
net income tax benefit expense is a function of the mix between the company s domestic and international pre tax earnings losses  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which the company operates 
income tax expense of million was recognized on a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a tax benefit of million recognized on a pre tax loss of million in in the company formed a cayman island corporation  diamond offshore international limited  which is a wholly owned subsidiary 
certain of the company s rigs that operate internationally are now owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited 
effective january   the company began to postpone remittance of the earnings from this subsidiary to the us and to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally 
consequently  no us taxes were provided on these earnings and no us tax benefits were recognized on losses during or the company recognized tax expense of million for despite a million pre tax loss primarily as a result of million of unrepatriated losses in international tax jurisdictions for which no u

this decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation from the ocean vanguard and the ocean patriot  which the company acquired in december and march  respectively 
depreciation also increased due to additional depreciation for five of the company s recently upgraded jack up rigs  additional depreciation for the ocean rover  which completed its upgrade in july and additional depreciation for the ocean baroness  which completed its upgrade in march loss gain on sale and disposition of assets 
a loss on the sale and disposition of assets of million occurred during primarily due to the sale of two of the company s semisubmersible drilling rigs  the ocean century and ocean prospector

sources of liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are its cash flows from operations  proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and other borrowings and its cash reserves 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments and marketable securities  representing the company s investment of cash available for current operations 
cash flows from operations 
the company operates in an industry that has been  and is expected to continue to be  extremely competitive and highly cyclical 
the dayrates received by the company s drilling rigs and rig utilization rates are a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace which is generally correlated with the price of oil and natural gas 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs  and vice versa 
the same factors  primarily demand for drilling services  which is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development as well as a variety of political and economic factors  and availability of rigs in a particular geographical region  affect both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within the company s control and are difficult to predict

liquidity and capital requirements the company s liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
cash required to meet the company s capital commitments is determined by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating the company s ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  including water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
it is management s opinion that operating cash flows and the company s cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments  however  the company will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital 
table of contents expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes 
the company s ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the company s results of operations  its current financial condition  current market conditions and other factors beyond its control 
the company believes it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements in the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and continuing rig enhancements  and working capital requirements

see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in item of this report 
the company s measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the company at december  and december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
the company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since the company s investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it 
the company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
the company s investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the company s investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and december   due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company s long term debt  as of december  and december  is denominated in us dollars 
the company s debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
during the company invested in fixed rate australian dollar 
table of contents time deposits and at december  million australian dollars equivalent to million of time deposits were included in investments and marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  the following table presents the company s market risk by category interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates fair value asset liability market risk december  december  category of risk exposure in thousands interest rate marketable securities  a  a  c c long term debt  b  b foreign exchange australian dollar time deposits  d  d a the fair market value of the company s investment in marketable securities is based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and december  b the fair values of the company s senior notes  which were issued in august  debentures due and zero coupon debentures due are based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and december  the fair value of the company s ocean alliance lease leaseback agreement is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of for december  and for december  c the calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of basis points at december  and december  d the calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of a decrease in foreign exchange rates of at december
