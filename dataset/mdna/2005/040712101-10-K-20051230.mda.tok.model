recent restaurant dispositions and charges in fiscal  the company determined that its restaurant  lutece  located in new york city  had been impaired by the events of september th and the continued weakness in the economy 
based upon the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows related to the company s long lived fixed assets at lutece  the company determined that impairment had occurred 
to estimate the fair value of such long lived fixed assets  for determining the impairment amount  the company used the expected present value of the future cash flows 
the company projected continuing negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future with no value for subletting or assigning the lease for the premises 
as a result  the company determined that there was no value to the long lived fixed assets

net operating income of  was included in losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended october  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 published by the sec  recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact its financial condition and results of operations  the company views certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of certain accounting policies  which may require the company to make estimates and assumptions of future events 
in the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company estimates the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which are not readily apparent from other sources 
the primary estimates underlying the company s financial statements include allowances for potential bad debts on accounts and notes receivable  the useful lives and recoverability of its assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments  the realizable value of its tax assets and other matters 
management bases its estimates on certain assumptions  which they believe are reasonable in the circumstances and actual results could differ from those estimates 
although management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the near term would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or the results of operation  differences in actual results could be material to the financial statements 
long lived assets the company annually assesses any impairment in value of long lived assets to be held and used 
the company evaluates the possibility of impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
if such cash flows are less than carrying value the company then reduces the asset to its fair value 
fair value is generally calculated using discounted cash flows 
various factors such as sales growth and operating margins and proceeds from a sale are part of this analysis 
future results could differ from the company s projections with a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
leases the company is obligated under various lease agreements for certain restaurants 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods as described below 
within the provisions of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that the company would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as incurred 
certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent 
the company records rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight line rent expense for each restaurant 
the judgments of the company may produce materially different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease terms were used 
deferred income tax valuation allowance the company provides such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carry forwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets during  the fasb issued fas  which requires that for the company  effective september   goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life  cease amortizing 
fas requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit the company is being treated as one reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  the company performs internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables
