item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and trends for the future should be read together with selected financial data and our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
any discussion and analysis regarding trends in our future financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as more fully identified in forward looking statements and risk factors 
our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
overview surmodics is a leading provider of surface modification and drug delivery technologies to the healthcare industry 
the company is organized into three operating segments composed of six technology centered and industry focused business units 
the drug delivery operating segment contains the drug delivery business unit  which is responsible for technologies dedicated to site specific delivery of drugs  and the ophthalmology division  which is dedicated to the advancement of treatments for eye diseases  such as age related macular degeneration amd and diabetic macular edema dme  two of the leading causes of blindness 
the hydrophilic and other operating segment consists of three business units hydrophilic technologies business unit  which focuses on enhancing medical devices with advanced lubricious coatings that facilitate their placement and maneuverability in the body  regenerative technologies business unit  which is developing platforms intended to augment or replace tissue organ function eg  cell encapsulation applications  or to modify medical devices to facilitate tissue organ recovery through natural repair mechanisms eg  hemo biocompatible coatings  and orthopedics business unit  which is committed to innovative solutions for orthopedics patients using proven surmodics technologies  and creating new technology solutions to existing patient care gaps in the orthopedics field 
the diagnostics operating segment contains the diagnostics and drug discovery business unit  which includes our genomics slide technologies  our stabilization products for immunoassay diagnostics tests  our in vitro diagnostic format technology and the work being performed to develop synthetic cell culture products 
revenue in each of our operating segments is derived from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our patented surface modification and drug delivery technologies and in vitro diagnostic formats to customers  the sale of reagent chemicals to licensees of our technologies  stabilization products to the diagnostics industry and coated glass slides to the genomics market  and research and development fees generated customer projects 
revenue should be expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our technologies  the timing of introductions of coated products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers products  the number and size of development projects that are entered into  the number and terms of new license agreements that are finalized  the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to licensees  and the timing of future acquisitions we complete  if any 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we treat our three operating segments as one reportable segment 
we made this determination because our operating segments currently share the same facilities  a significant percentage of our employees provide support services including research and development to each operating segment  technology and products from each operating segment are marketed to the same or similar customers  each operating segment uses the same sales and marketing resources  and each operating segment operates in the same regulatory environment 
on january   we acquired all of the assets of innorx  inc by paying cash and issuing shares of surmodics common stock to innorx stockholders 
innorx was an early stage company developing drug delivery implants and therapies for the ophthalmology market 
the assets we acquired were folded into our newly created ophthalmology division 
prior to the acquisition  surmodics held an ownership interest in innorx of less than and accounted for the investment under the cost method 
upon completion of the innorx acquisition  we retroactively adjusted our previously reported results to show the impact of accounting for innorx under the equity method 
the net impact was an approximate  reduction in net income for fiscal year from previously reported results 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the financial statements 
management believes the following are the critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
royalty revenue is generated when a licensed customer sells products incorporating our technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with the report 
we recognize initial license fees over the term of the related agreement 
revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue on sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges or other measure of fair value was less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment charge 
results in the third quarter of fiscal year include a non cash asset impairment charge of million against our bloomington  minnesota contract manufacturing facility 
management determined the fair value using this real estate market data 
in september  we entered into an agreement to sell the bloomington facility 
results in the fourth quarter of fiscal year include an additional non cash asset impairment charge of million to reflect the fair value based on the agreed selling price 
we intend to consolidate operations at our eden prairie  minnesota headquarters by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities 
our investment policy calls for no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
investments are classified as available for sale  that is  investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
results of operations years ended september  and dollars in thousands fiscal year fiscal year increase increase revenue drug delivery hydrophilic and other diagnostics total revenue revenue 
fiscal year revenue was million  an increase of million or from fiscal year we experienced double digit revenue growth in all three operating segments as detailed in the table above and further explained in the narrative in the paragraphs that follow 
drug delivery 
revenue in the drug delivery segment increased to million from million in fiscal year significant growth in royalties and license fees offset a decrease in sales of reagent chemical products chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices 
drug delivery derives a substantial majority of its revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a johnson johnson company  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
revenue from sales of reagents to cordis decreased in fiscal year because of lower unit prices resulting from a contractual reduction in reagent pricing 
unit volume was little changed from fiscal year there are no further contractual price reductions and management does not anticipate further reductions in reagent prices to cordis 
management believes the sales volume of reagents sold to cordis will be directly impacted by anticipated continued improvements in manufacturing efficiencies by cordis in addition to relative market share positions of drug eluting stent players 
drug delivery research and development revenue in fiscal year was about the same as the prior year  with increased revenue from customers other than cordis offsetting lower revenue from cordis 
in addition  prior to our january acquisition of innorx  a portion of our research and development revenue was attributable to innorx as a customer 
following the acquisition  we no longer record revenue for research and development activities in connection with the innorx technology 
future royalty revenue could decrease because of lower cypher stent sales as a result of continuing competition from boston scientific corporation s taxus drug eluting stent 
boston scientific was granted approval by the fda to begin marketing in the us its taxus drug eluting stent in our second fiscal quarter of the taxus stent competes directly with the cypher stent 
while the overall market for drug eluting stents is expected to continue growing  we anticipate that quarterly royalty revenue from the cypher stent will continue to be volatile as the various marketers of drug eluting stents continue competing in the marketplace and as others enter the marketplace 
management expects royalties from the cypher stent to constitute a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal year however  whether and the extent to which royalties from the cypher stent continue to constitute a significant source of revenue is subject to a number of risks  including intellectual property litigation generally and specifically the damages  settlements and mutual agreements that may result from various infringement suits between boston scientific and cordis in which each has reported to have recently been found to have violated certain intellectual property rights of the other 
hydrophilic and other 
hydrophilic and other revenue increased to million  because of increased royalties and license fees and research and development fees 
whereas a significant percentage of revenue in drug delivery is attributable to cordis  in hydrophilic and other there are several dozen licensees and an even larger number of coated products generating royalties 
the growth in royalties reflects both newly introduced licensed products and increased sales of coated products already on the market 
while management anticipates continued revenue growth in fiscal year  it likely will not be as strong as growth in fiscal year diagnostics 
diagnostics revenue increased to million 
a substantial majority of the growth resulted from increased royalty revenue under certain sublicenses  whose royalty streams we purchased from abbott in september while revenue from these royalty streams from abbott are anticipated to continue into the future  we anticipate the growth in diagnostics revenue in fiscal year will not be as high in percentage terms as results 
diagnostics derives a significant percentage of its revenue from ge healthcare and abbott laboratories 
revenue from product sales increased resulting from higher sales of stabilization products used for immunoassay diagnostic tests 
effective february  we terminated our stabilization product distribution agreement with seracare and began selling directly to the us diagnostics industry 
management believes revenue from stabilization products will continue to increase when compared to prior year comparable periods because of the impact of selling directly to the us diagnostics industry  rather than through a distributor 
product costs 
product costs were million for the fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
overall product margins averaged compared with for the comparable period last year 
management anticipates overall product margins will be about the same in fiscal year research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal year a majority of the increase reflects legal costs associated with intellectual property processing and applications 
in addition  we incurred costs associated with the clinical trial of our i vation intravitreal implant and increased personnel costs related to establishing our new ophthalmology division 
management believes research and development expense will continue to increase in fiscal year as a result of anticipated expenses for development activities and clinical trials associated with the intravitreal implant 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  a decrease from the prior year 
a substantial portion of the decrease resulted from lower payroll costs related to a reduction in senior marketing personnel in connection with a company wide reorganization in management anticipates sales and marketing expense to increase modestly in fiscal year general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year  a increase compared with fiscal year  primarily reflecting increased compensation  legal and utility costs 
management anticipates general and administrative expense to increase modestly in fiscal year purchased in process research and development 
on january   we acquired all of the assets of innorx  inc by paying cash and issuing shares of surmodics common stock to innorx stockholders 
results in fiscal year included a non cash in process research and development charge of million 
the fair value of the in process research and development was determined by an outside valuation consultant 
asset impairment charge 
results in fiscal year included a non cash asset impairment charge of million against our bloomington  minnesota contract manufacturing facility 
results in the fiscal year included a non cash asset impairment charge of million against the facility 
in september  we entered into an agreement to sell the bloomington facility and plan to consolidate operations at our eden prairie  minnesota headquarters 
other income  net 
other income was million in fiscal year  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the increase reflects higher levels of investable cash and higher yields generated from our investment portfolio 
previously reported fiscal year results have been retroactively adjusted to show the impact of accounting for innorx under the equity method 
prior to completing the acquisition of innorx in january  we accounted for our investment in innorx under the cost method 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision was million in fiscal year compared with million in fiscal year excluding the impact of the million in process research and development charge  which is not tax deductible  the effective tax rate was in fiscal year  compared with for the same period last year 
years ended september  and dollars in thousands fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease increase decrease revenue drug delivery hydrophilic and other diagnostics total revenue revenue 
fiscal year revenue was million  an increase of over fiscal year the growth in total revenue was attributable to growth in our drug delivery and hydrophilic and other segments as detailed in the table above 
we provide a narrative of revenue for each of our three operating segments in the paragraphs that follow 
drug delivery 
drug delivery revenue increased to million in fiscal year drug delivery derives a substantial majority of its revenue from all three primary sources royalties and license fees  product sales and research and development fees from cordis corporation a johnson johnson company on its cypher stent 
fiscal year drug delivery revenue growth was attributable to a significant increase in royalties and license fees compared with the prior year 
cordis cypher stent received us fda approval in april the third quarter of fiscal year 
accordingly  results reflect a full year of cypher sales in the united states  whereas fiscal year results include us sales of cypher for slightly less than months 
this increase in royalties and license fees more than offset a significant reduction in research and development revenue and a decrease in sales of reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices 
research and development revenue decreased in principally as a result of the lower level of clinical coating work following fda approval of cypher 
although cordis purchased a substantial majority of reagents sold in fiscal year  reagent chemical sales to cordis decreased in as both volume and unit prices decreased 
hydrophilic and other 
in fiscal year  hydrophilic and other revenue increased to million  with growth contributed from all three primary revenue sources 
royalties and license fees increased modestly compared with fiscal year sales of reagent chemicals increased substantially compared with fiscal year diagnostics 
overall fiscal year revenue decreased about to million with nearly all of the decrease caused by lower royalties from ge healthcare stemming from scheduled contractual royalty decreases 
in addition  fiscal year results include a  payment related to the achievement of a technical milestone while results include a similar milestone payment of  product costs 
product costs were million for fiscal year  an increase of  from the million recorded in fiscal year overall product margins averaged  a decrease from in fiscal year higher cost non cordis products made up a higher percentage of total product sales in fiscal year research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for fiscal year were million  an increase of  or  compared with the same period in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of  or  from fiscal year a substantial portion of the decrease resulted from lower payroll costs related to a reduction in senior marketing personnel in connection with a company wide reorganization 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of  or  compared with fiscal year the decrease reflects efficiencies gained in the reorganization as well as lower legal costs 
asset impairment charge 
results in fiscal year included a non cash asset impairment charge of million against our bloomington  minnesota contract manufacturing facility other income  net 
other income was million for fiscal year  a decrease of  from fiscal year investment income decreased as a result of lower investment yields and the early payoff of a million note receivable 
in addition  much of the decrease reflects lower capital gains generated from our investment portfolio 
in fiscal year  our investment advisor sold and reinvested a portion of our bond portfolio generating gains of  results in fiscal year reflect approximately  in gains from such sales 
previously reported fiscal year results have been retroactively adjusted to show the impact of accounting for innorx under the equity method 
prior to completing the acquisition of innorx in january  we accounted for our investment in innorx under the cost method 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the effective tax rate was in fiscal year  a decrease from in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had working capital of million and cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
our investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
our investment policy requires that no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
the primary investment objective of the portfolio is to provide for the safety of principal and appropriate liquidity while generating an above benchmark lehman brothers year government index total rate of return 
management plans to continue to direct our investment advisors to manage our investments primarily for the safety of principal for the foreseeable future 
we had positive cash flows from operating activities of approximately million in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year we conduct a significant majority of our operations at our eden prairie  minnesota headquarters 
in addition  we own a facility in bloomington  minnesota 
we believe we have adequate office space and manufacturing capacity in our eden prairie headquarters to support our business and strategic plan 
as such  in september  we entered into an agreement to sell the bloomington facility and plan to consolidate operations in eden prairie 
during our fiscal third quarter  construction began to improve the research and development capabilities at the eden prairie facility 
management estimates expending a total of approximately million 
the capital improvements are expected to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year in february  we invested million in innorx  inc  an alabama based  early stage company developing drug delivery devices and therapies for the ophthalmology market 
we made an additional investment of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year on january   we entered into a merger agreement whereby surmodics acquired all of the assets of innorx  inc by paying approximately million in cash and issuing  shares of surmodics common stock to innorx stockholders 
on july   we issued  shares of surmodics common stock to the shareholders of innorx upon the successful completion of the first milestone involving the innorx technology acquired in the purchase of innorx 
upon the successful completion of the remaining development and commercial milestones involving innorx technology acquired in the transaction  we will be required to issue up to an aggregate  additional shares of our common stock to the stockholders of innorx 
as the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets  surmodics was required to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and the total consideration given 
the fair value was determined by an outside valuation consultant 
the assets of innorx we acquired consisted almost exclusively of in process research and development assets 
in our second fiscal quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to write off the value of these in process research and development assets 
in connection with the purchase  we recorded an million credit to additional paid in capital to record the aggregate estimated value of the contingent payment obligations 
since the contingent payment obligations are recorded as additional paid in capital  the obligations will not have any impact on future results of operations 
in january  we made an equity investment of approximately million in octoplus  a privately owned company based in the netherlands active in the development of pharmaceutical formulations incorporating novel biodegradable polymers 
the million investment  which is accounted for under the cost method  represents an ownership interest of less than 
we have invested a total of million in novocell  inc  a privately held irvine  california based biotech firm that is developing a unique treatment for diabetes 
working with novocell  our researchers have created a coating that encapsulates pancreatic islet cells  the cells that produce insulin in the human body 
if successful  this treatment using coated islet cells could dramatically change the treatment of diabetes 
while we anticipate that our investment in novocell will help facilitate the commercialization of our technology and result in revenue for the company in the future  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
novocell s primary technology is in its development stage  and we anticipate that it will be years before commercialization may be realized 
the million investment  which is accounted for under the cost method  is included in other assets and represents an ownership interest of less than 
in may  we invested million in thermopeutix  an early stage company developing novel medical devices for the treatment of vascular and neurovascular diseases  including stroke 
in addition to the investment  we have licensed our hydrophilic and hemocompatible coating technologies to thermopeutix for use with its devices 
the million investment  which is accounted for under the cost method  represents an ownership interest of less than 
risks and uncertainties surrounding a development stage company s ability to obtain on a timely and frequent basis financing needed to continue its development activities currently affect  and will continually affect  the prospects of our investments in novocell  octoplus and thermopeutix and the revenue they may ultimately generate 
there is no assurance that the development stage companies listed above will successfully meet their immediate or future financing needs or that their financing needs will be met when required 
if adverse results occur in the development of their respective technology  or if their respective financing needs are not continually met  the viability of such companies  the value of our investment and their ability to be future sources of revenue for the company will be in jeopardy  and our investment in such companies would likely be considered impaired and charged against earnings at such time 
in september  we made a commitment to purchase for million certain additional sublicense rights and the accompanying future royalty revenue streams under certain sublicenses through an amendment to our diagnostic format patent license with abbott laboratories 
prior to such amendment  we were receiving only a portion of the royalties under such sublicenses 
the first million installment was paid in november the remaining installments are reflected in other long term liabilities 
as of september   we had no debt  nor did we have any credit agreements 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations into the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements at september  or during the year then ended 
contractual obligations presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments 
we do not have any long term debt or any capital or material operating leases

this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement where no specific transition provisions are included 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the company for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal year the company does not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment 
the revision requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees 
the statement eliminates the alternative method of accounting for employee share based payments previously available under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
the statement is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

the additional disclosures required by eitf and maintained by the fsp issued in november have been considered for inclusion in the notes to our audited fiscal financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment policy requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
surmodics does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because the company s inventory exposure is not material 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
