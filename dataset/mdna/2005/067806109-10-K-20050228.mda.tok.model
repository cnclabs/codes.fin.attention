item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview highlights the company achieved record sales of million and growth in operating income  to million in the record sales year was driven by organic growth in all of the company s operating groups with the most significant growth in barnes aerospace 
during  barnes aerospace entered into three new aftermarket revenue sharing programs rsps  committing approximately million with a major aerospace company  securing long term relationships for aftermarket sales of engine parts with attractive financial returns 
these programs had a positive impact on results and are expected to continue to have a positive impact going forward 
profit shortfalls at associated spring and barnes distribution were attributed to increases in raw material prices and efforts to improve customer service  respectively 
as of year end  barnes distribution customer service levels  as measured by fill rate  have returned to their targeted range and the integration efforts that contributed to these service issues have been completed 
in late  the company incurred discrete charges of approximately million  or per share  related to actions to offset higher raw material costs going forward at associated spring and enable the realization of benefits from the kar products integration and improved customer service levels at barnes distribution 
these charges included million related to personnel reductions  which are estimated to generate annual savings of approximately million  and million in inventory and facility charges 
these charges were partially offset by million of benefits related to the reduction of lease obligations on idle facilities within barnes distribution 
management objectives management has embraced a corporate culture within barnes group that has as its common goals the generation of sustainable  profitable growth and building lasting value for its stockholders 
the company s strategies for generating growth include organic growth from new products and services  markets and customers  and growth from strategic acquisitions  of which nine have been completed since our business barnes group consists of three operating segments barnes distribution  an international distributor of industrial mrop supplies  associated spring  one of the world s largest manufacturers of precision mechanical and nitrogen gas springs  and a global supplier of retaining rings  specialty spring products reed valves and shock discs  and injection molded plastic components  and barnes aerospace  a manufacturer and repairer of highly engineered assemblies and products for aircraft engines  airframes  and land based industrial gas turbines 
in each of these businesses  barnes group is among the leaders in the market niches it serves  and has highly recognized brands for many of the products it sells or manufactures 
key performance indicators management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the operating profit of the respective businesses  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses  as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
management also uses an internal measurement tool called ppat  or performance profit after tax 
ppat is an economic value added eva like metric that calculates operating profit after tax  less a charge for the capital employed by the business 
management utilizes ppat in economic decision making  such as capital expenditures  investments in growth initiatives  customer pricing decisions  and evaluation of acquisitions 
the goal of utilizing ppat is to create a mindset among all employees to use capital in the most efficient way possible and to link decisions to stockholder value creation 

table of contents in addition to ppat  which is a measurement tool common among each of the operating groups  each business has its own key performance indicators kpis  a number of which are focused on customer satisfaction 
in barnes distribution  kpis include daily sales average  or dsa  average order size  fill rate  which is the percentage of order lines filled on the first pass from the distribution center assigned to that customer  and order turnaround  which tracks the time between order receipt and shipment to the customer 
at associated spring  kpis include sales and orders per day  which together provide visibility on sales in the next days 
management tracks inventory turns and sales per employee to gauge efficiency  and measures on time delivery and the number of defective parts per million as means of evaluating customer service levels 
at barnes aerospace  important kpis are customer orders and backlog  which are utilized to forecast how sales will develop over the next months 
in the oem operations  management closely tracks quality measurements and on time delivery to its customers 
in the aftermarket operations  management measures turnaround time of overhauled or repaired parts returned to the customers 
key industry data in each business  management also tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector 
at barnes distribution  these data include the institute for supply management s pmi composite index the pmi and the federal reserve s industrial production index the ipi  which are monthly indicators of the health of us manufacturing activity 
management tracks similar indices in canada  france and the united kingdom and also utilizes the business conditions report of the precision metalforming association  which correlates well with demand for barnes distribution s raymond products 
for associated spring  key data include the production of light vehicles  both in the us and globally  new vehicle platform  engine and transmission programs  durable goods orders  handset purchases for cell phones  and capital investments in the telecommunications and electronics industries 
at barnes aerospace  for its oem operations  management regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers  as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft 
in the aftermarket operations  management monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet  the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service  and aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines 
management also monitors annual appropriations for the us military related to new aircraft purchases and maintenance 
acquisitions acquisitions have been a key growth driver for the company in each of its three business segments

results of operations sales in millions change change barnes distribution associated spring barnes aerospace intersegment sales total barnes group reported record net sales of million in  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million 
the sales increase was driven mainly by organic sales growth of million  million at barnes distribution  million at associated spring and million at barnes aerospace which was offset in part by an increase of million in intersegment sales 
the company s recent acquisitions contributed million to barnes distribution s sales and million to associated spring s sales 
additionally  the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar  primarily in europe and canada  increased sales by approximately million 
geographically  the company s international sales increased year over year and domestic sales increased 
excluding the positive impact on sales of foreign currency translation  the company s international sales increased in over in  barnes group s net sales were up million  or  over net sales of million 
the sales increase reflected the company s recent acquisitions  which contributed million to barnes distribution s sales and million to associated spring s sales 
also contributing to the sales increase was continued growth of associated spring s nitrogen gas business 
the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar  primarily in europe and canada  had a positive impact of million 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in associated spring s north american and asian sales and a decline in sales at barnes aerospace  which coincided with the continuing decline in the commercial aerospace markets 

table of contents expenses and operating income in millions change change cost of sales sales gross profit sales selling and administrative expenses sales operating income sales operating income was million in  an increase of when compared with operating income included a million pre tax charge taken in the fourth quarter of related to costs of personnel reductions at associated spring and barnes distribution which will occur in the first quarter of these costs relate to actions to offset higher raw material costs going forward at associated spring and enable the realization of benefits from the kar products integration and improved customer service levels at barnes distribution 
operating income also included million in inventory and facility charges which were partially offset by million of benefits related to the reduction of lease obligations at idle facilities 
these results reflect significantly higher operating profit at barnes aerospace offset by lower operating profits at both barnes distribution and associated spring  which are more fully discussed in the financial performance by business segment section below 
operating income margin declined from in to in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to  or a increase  which is slightly more than the growth rate in sales for the year 
this reflects a shift in overall sales mix to the manufacturing businesses which have lower gross margins than the distribution business combined with lower gross profit margins at barnes distribution and associated spring 
gross profit margins at barnes distribution were negatively impacted by a shift in sales mix to larger accounts which traditionally have lower pricing and to additional costs incurred to improve customer service levels 
associated spring s margin compression resulted from higher raw material costs 
gross profit margins for the company were also negatively impacted by a million lifo inventory adjustment in total selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to from in this decrease was also driven by the higher proportion of sales in the manufacturing businesses  which have a lower selling expense component than the distribution business 
impacting both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses were higher benefit costs including medical and pension costs 
included in selling and administrative expenses in was million related to the fourth quarter severance charge discussed above as well as approximately million of incremental external costs related to the company s sarbanes oxley section compliance effort 
operating income was million in  an increase of compared with million in these results reflect higher operating profit at barnes distribution 
overall operating income margin increased to in compared with in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to reflecting improvements in gross profit margins at barnes distribution combined with the shift in overall sales mix to the higher margin distribution business  a result of the kar acquisition 
total selling and administrative expenses increased to as a percentage of sales  from in this increase was also driven by the higher proportion of sales in the distribution business  which has a higher selling expense component 
impacting both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses were higher postretirement benefit expenses at associated spring and lower pension income company wide 
pension income decreased by million due primarily to reduced investment performance of plan assets in and and a lower discount rate 
the cost of postretirement benefits  other than pensions  increased million due in part to a higher medical cost trend  lower discount rate and the full year impact of increased benefit levels provided to certain us employees 

table of contents other income expense other income totaled million in  compared with million in the reduction is principally due to lower equity income from nasco  the company s joint venture investment 
additionally  investment of foreign cash in the rsps reduced short term investments and related interest income 
the decrease in other income in compared with was due to foreign exchange transaction gains of million in compared with foreign exchange losses of million in  which were included in other expenses 
the foreign exchange transaction gains and losses related primarily to exposure on us dollar denominated financial instruments  primarily in the company s operation in brazil 
the company s policy is to hedge foreign currency transaction exposure except in locations where the local currency has historically weakened against the us dollar  which includes mexico and brazil 
the decrease in foreign exchange gains was partially offset by higher interest income due to higher interest rates in brazil and increased short term investments in canada 
although average borrowings increased in compared to  interest expense decreased due to a reduction in average interest rates 
the lower average interest rates resulted from principal payments on higher cost fixed rate debt and favorable terms negotiated in the amended and restated revolving credit agreement completed in the second quarter of interest expense increased in compared to as a result of higher borrowings related primarily to the kar acquisition  and a reduction in the amount of debt subject to variable interest rate swaps 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  compared with in and in the increase in the tax rate in when compared to reflects the absence of two discrete beneficial tax matters included in that effectively reduced the tax rate from to 
the benefits recorded in were associated with a brazilian tax matter which was resolved in and the anticipated utilization of minimum asset tax carryforwards in mexico 
when compared to  the benefits of these reversals were partially offset by the absence in of an additional deduction which was taken during for the company s retirement savings plan dividends 
the dividend deduction resulted from a retroactive election in for the dividend distribution  pursuant to an amendment to the plan 
among other items impacting the future tax rate is the mix of income between us and foreign operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory income tax rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate 
in the normal course of business  the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
the irs is currently reviewing the company for the tax years through the company currently has one disputed irs tax issue with a potential tax cost of approximately million 
the company and its advisors believe the company will prevail on this issue

financial performance by business segment barnes distribution in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin barnes distribution achieved record sales of million for  a increase over organic sales increased million or while kar  which the company purchased on february   contributed incremental sales of million and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates provided incremental sales of million 
key performance indicators in the us  such as the daily sales average and average order size  improved in each quarter of customer service levels improved and returned to historical levels by year end 
organic sales growth was driven mainly by positive results in the us from strategic growth initiatives including national accounts  e commerce platforms and tier relationships with industrial distributors  offset in part by decreases in sales to other customers 
the national accounts selling team opened over new relationships during geographically  sales in europe increased over while sales in canada decreased 
additionally  barnes distribution s raymond business reported higher year over year sales as a result of the general industrial recovery and new product introductions 
barnes distribution s operating profit decreased from which was partially due to a million charge for severance costs and million in inventory and facility charges taken in the fourth quarter of the reduction in operating profit was also driven by incremental costs of approximately million related to strategic growth initiatives  including costs to strengthen the sales force  and approximately million in costs incurred to address customer service issues 
these costs were partially offset by incremental synergistic savings from the kar acquisition of approximately million and lower integration costs of million and million of benefits related to the reduction of lease obligations on idle facilities during the kar integration was completed during  within months of the acquisition 
profit was adversely impacted by a shift in sales mix to large accounts which traditionally have lower pricing than barnes distribution s core business 
gross profit was negatively impacted by higher product costs particularly related to steel supply and freight costs 
these increases in costs were largely offset by customer pricing increases 
in addition  the year over year profit comparison was negatively impacted by the million gain on the sale of a distribution center in outlook management believes the outlook for markets served by barnes distribution  particularly those which are the focus of our strategic growth initiatives and those which are located in the us  continues to strengthen 
additionally  barnes distribution has continued to improve its performance in its kpis  specifically customer service levels  or fill rates  which returned to historical levels and should have a positive impact on sales going forward 
discrete charges incurred in late related to personnel reductions are estimated to generate annual savings of million 
steel supply issues  particularly for fasteners  continue to negatively impact barnes distribution 
suppliers have indicated that they are having difficulty procuring steel to meet customer demand which has affected availability and pricing  a trend that is expected to continue into management is seeking to recover the increased costs through price increases to its customers and is looking for new offshore sources to mitigate any negative impact going forward 
sales increased in due mainly to the acquisition of kar  which contributed approximately million of sales 
sales were also favorably impacted by the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
new growth initiatives contributed approximately million in sales and the raymond business expanded product lines and generated higher sales in markets outside the us these increases were offset by decreases in other customer markets 

table of contents the kar acquisition also had a favorable impact on operating profit in discrete costs of million were incurred related to the kar integration into barnes distribution s base business 
however  these discrete costs were more than offset by the realization of estimated cost savings of million 
the operating profit also included a gain of million from the sale of a distribution center and severance costs of million 
associated spring in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin associated spring reported record sales of million in this performance was driven in large part by organic sales growth of million 
growth came in all of its key market segments  most notably in the industrial product markets which realized sales growth of driven primarily by success of our reed products in brazil 
additionally  the heavy truck  light vehicle  telecommunications and electronics  and nitrogen gas spring markets had positive year over year sales trends 
de sta co  which the company acquired in september  contributed approximately million in sales in the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar  primarily in europe  had a positive impact on sales of approximately million during associated spring s operating profit decreased in resulting in a operating margin  compared to in operating profit in was positively impacted by increased sales  mainly in associated spring s international locations 
however  overall operating profit was reduced by raw material cost increases and unfavorable lifo adjustments aggregating million in and a million charge for severance costs recorded in the fourth quarter 
the personnel reductions  which are expected to reduce the associated spring workforce by approximately  are aimed at offsetting the higher raw material costs going forward and are expected to generate estimated annual savings of million 
additionally in  the company incurred approximately million in costs related to operating improvement initiatives focused on capacity  quality issues and lean manufacturing  approximately million of higher medical costs and approximately million of cost of sales expense related to the purchase accounting step up of inventory to fair value at de sta co 
outlook the outlook for the markets served by associated spring appears to be somewhat positive 
an improving us economy is expected to positively impact the industrial market 
published data have indicated that sales in the heavy truck segment are expected to remain robust through  but sales in the light vehicle market are expected to be a bit soft in early due to high dealer inventory levels at the end of management also expects near term growth in the telecommunications and electronics market and the nitrogen gas springs market 
during the first quarter of  associated spring will begin shipping from its recently opened manufacturing facility in monterrey  mexico which should positively impact cost and capacity issues 
raw material issues  particularly for steel  continue to affect operating profit as suppliers are exerting cost pressures on associated spring and worldwide steel supplies remain challenging 
associated spring has attempted to counter the higher raw material costs with the expected savings from the headcount reductions going forward and will continue to work aggressively with its customers to reach a mutually beneficial outcome in terms of cost sharing and ensuring product availability 
further  the company will be negotiating two labor agreements and one master pension and retiree healthcare agreement affecting three us facilities that will expire in the first half of any resulting cost increases or labor actions could negatively impact profit margins 
associated spring generated sales of million in this increase over reflected incremental sales from the acquisitions combined with the positive impact on sales  primarily in europe  from the strengthening of foreign currency against the us dollar and higher sales of nitrogen gas springs 

table of contents incremental sales in from the acquisitions of seeger orbis in february and spectrum in april were million 
offsetting these increases were declines in sales in the north american light vehicle market  a drop in sales related to a planned withdrawal from the heavy truck brake spring market  and lower sales in the asian telecommunications and electronics market 
in  associated spring outperformed the decline in north american light vehicle production 
associated spring s operating profit decreased in and reflected an operating margin  compared to in profits in were positively impacted by increased sales in europe  the closure of the texas plant in and the absence of million of discrete costs related to purchase accounting adjustments recorded in however  overall margins were dampened by a decrease in sales in the higher margin telecommunications and electronics market  approximately million of higher personnel costs  including pension  postretirement and medical costs  and a million reduction in the carrying value of the texas facility  held for sale at the end of barnes aerospace in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin barnes aerospace achieved record sales of million in increased sales reflect solid growth in aftermarket sales  which increased and were driven by million in sales from the rsps and a increase in the overhaul and repair business 
barnes aerospace entered into three additional aftermarket rsps during which drove the incremental rsp sales 
additionally  oem sales increased 
total orders for were million  compared with million in and million in included in the orders were million in orders for a large commercial engine program and million of direct and indirect military orders 
order backlog increased to a record million at december   from million at december  orders and order backlog were affected by the same factors that generated record sales 
in  barnes aerospace s operating profit nearly doubled from operating profit was positively impacted by the sharply higher aftermarket and oem sales volumes and the profit contribution from the rsps 
partially offsetting these factors were higher incentive compensation expense and an unfavorable lifo inventory adjustment 
outlook sales at barnes aerospace are expected to remain robust into on the strength of sales from a large commercial engine program  higher military sales and the aftermarket rsps 
additionally  based upon published information  recovery in the sales of commercial aircraft is anticipated in  which is expected to impact aerospace component suppliers such as barnes aerospace beginning in however  continuing high fuel prices may adversely impact near term aftermarket sales as airlines defer heavy maintenance to offset higher fuel costs 
also  higher raw material costs driven by raw material availability could negatively impact sales and profit in sales in were down from due mainly to the decline in commercial aircraft deliveries compared to the sales decline reflected the fall off in the commercial airline market in the wake of the events of operating profit remained relatively unchanged in and as a result of headcount reductions and productivity actions taken in that were aimed at positioning the business for a period of lower commercial aerospace volume 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditure levels  dividends  capital stock transactions  effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate bank lines of credit 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths 
management continues to focus on cash flow and working capital and anticipates that operating activities in will generate significant cash 
this operating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near term organic business expansion and the company s current financial commitments 
any future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash  borrowings and equity  or a combination thereof 
cash flow in millions change change operating activities investing activities financing activities exchange rate effect decrease increase in cash nm nm not meaningful operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the company  generating million in cash during the decrease in operating cash flow in resulted mainly from the increased use of cash for working capital 
in particular  investments in working capital were required to support organic sales growth including a higher investment in receivables at barnes aerospace and associated spring  and a higher investment in inventory at barnes aerospace 
in addition  barnes distribution increased inventory to improve customer service levels and to mitigate certain price increases  particularly on steel products 
cash used by investing activities in included million in participation fees related to the aftermarket rsps which are more fully discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report

see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report for a discussion of the impact of the favorable foreign dividend provisions of the recently enacted american jobs creation act of the company maintains borrowing facilities with banks to supplement internal cash generation 
during  the company amended and restated its revolving credit agreement with participating banks 
the amended and restated revolving credit agreement extended the maturity date until june  increased the borrowing facility from million to million  decreased the interest rate to libor plus a spread ranging from to depending on the company s debt ratio at the time of the borrowing  and amended various financial and restrictive covenants

the company believes its credit facilities  coupled with cash generated from operations  are adequate for its anticipated future requirements 
the funded status of the company s pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets  the level of market interest rates and benefit obligations 
in  the fair value of pension plan securities traded in equity markets increased  which had a positive impact on the funded status of the plans 
however  the increase in the fair value of plan assets was more than offset by an increase in the benefit obligation due to normal service costs and a reduction in the discount rate 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the company records a minimum pension liability adjustment for under funded plans through a non cash after tax charge to accumulated other non owner changes to equity

the purchase obligation amount includes all outstanding purchase orders as of the balance sheet date as well as the minimum contractual obligation or termination penalty under other contracts 
the amounts for reflect anticipated contributions to the company s various pension plans 
other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these factors have historically been offset by price increases  operating improvements  and other cost savings initiatives 
during  the company  particularly the associated spring segment  experienced significant inflation in raw material prices  specifically steel  the majority of which was not recovered 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the last in  first out lifo method is used to value the majority of domestic inventories 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this annual assessment during the second quarter of based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management assumptions about expected future cash flows 
based on this 
table of contents assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans  particularly with respect to integrating acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
revenue sharing programs the company participates in aftermarket rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company pays participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program 
the recoverability of the intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts 
management updates revenue projections periodically  which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and obtaining industry projections 
the potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions 
a shortfall in future revenues may indicate an impairment of the intangible asset 
the company evaluates the remaining useful life of this asset to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
the intangible asset is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company has not revised the amortization period or identified any impairment of these intangible assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
reorganization of businesses for non acquisition related reorganizations as of and subsequent to january   the company records the cost of reorganization initiatives at the time the liability is incurred 
for reorganization initiatives in connection with acquisitions  and for all other reorganization initiatives prior to january   the company records liabilities at the time that management has approved and committed to a reorganization plan 
such a plan identifies all significant actions to be taken and specifies an expected completion date that is within a reasonable period of time 
the liability includes those costs that can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates are subject to adjustments based upon actual costs incurred 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies and significant assumptions related to pension and other postretirement benefits are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
the following table provides a breakout of the current targeted mix of investments  by asset classification  along with the historical rates of return for each asset class and the long term projected rates of return for the us plans 
target asset mix annual return historical long term projection asset class large cap growth large cap value small cap growth small cap value non us equity real estate related fixed income cash weighted average historical returns based on the life of the respective index  approximately years 
the historical rates of return were calculated based upon compounded average rates of return of published indices 
the target for fixed income and cash investments is lower than the fixed income and cash component of a typical pension trust 
the fixed income investments include a higher than average component of 
table of contents yield aggressive investments  including high yield corporate bonds 
based on the overall historical and projected rates of return  management is projecting the long term rate of return on its us pension assets to be a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would impact the company s pretax income by approximately million annually 
a one quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s pretax income by approximately million annually 
the company reviews these and other assumptions at least annually 
during  the fair value of the company s pension plan assets increased by million compared to an increase in projected benefit obligations of million 
the higher increase in the benefit obligation is driven by a basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate 
the company s pension expense for was million 
pension expense for is expected to increase by million over expense  primarily due to lower discount rates

in august  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts its fixed rate senior notes to variable rate debt 
the underlying debt is currently being repaid in equal installments with a corresponding reduction in the interest rate swap 
this interest swap agreement had a positive impact on earnings  reducing interest expense by million 
the company s primary interest rate risk is derived from its outstanding variable rate debt obligations

to reduce foreign currency exposure  management maintains the majority of foreign cash and short term investments in local currency and uses forward currency contracts for other us dollar denominated assets in an effort to reduce the effect of the volatility of changes in foreign exchange rates on the income statement 
in weaker currency countries  such as brazil and mexico  management assesses the strength of these currencies relative to the us dollar and may elect during periods of local currency weakness to invest excess cash in us dollar denominated instruments 
the company s exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high grade steel spring wire  titanium and other specialty metals 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to increases in those prices through its procurement and sales practices
