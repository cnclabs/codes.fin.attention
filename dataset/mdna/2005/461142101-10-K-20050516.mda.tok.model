strategic alliances intervoice continues to build strategic partner relationships with leading companies in key industries 
we have established partnerships with software and technology solution partners  system integration partners and niche market partners 
these alliances enhance our value proposition as delivered through our omvia product line  strengthen our ability to deliver end to end solutions  and extend our market reach 
in october  we announced the addition of intel netstructure tm dm v a resource series telephony boards supporting both salt and voicexml to our omvia voice framework suite for the development  deployment and management of voice solutions 
this partnership continues to allow our customers to select other powerful telephony boards from intel as part of their speech activated solutions 
we continue to collaborate with microsoft in a joint technology and marketing alliance to help make speech recognition solutions mainstream with the implementation of salt standards based solutions along with the microsoft speech server products 
in fiscal  we introduced our telephony interface manager tim software product and pre configured hardware platform for the deployment of speech applications in the microsoft speech server beta program 
in fiscal  we continued developing and introducing various products  including cti connectors and legacy host connectors  that enhance the functionality of the microsoft speech server product line 
during the middle of fiscal  we concluded the speech server beta program  and the microsoft speech server and our associated products and services became available for general sale and use 
we have also partnered with hp and intel to refine the hardware needed to develop  test and deploy microsoft speech server based solutions 
we continue to work closely with leaders of the speech technology industry 
we partner with scansoft to develop and bring to market speech recognition and text to speech solutions  and we leverage nuance speech software solutions to give people access to information and services anywhere  anytime and from any phone 
backlog our solutions backlog at february   and  which does not include the contracted value of future maintenance and managed services to be recognized  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect all existing backlog to be delivered within fiscal some of our sales are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
thus  our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of actual sales for any future period 
research and development research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  and included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
our research and development spending is focused in four key areas 
first  we are developing software tools to aid in the development and deployment of customer applications incorporating speech recognition  
table of contents text to speech  and other rich media technologies for enterprise  wireless  and fixed line providers 
next  we are developing server based application software platforms for operations and management of contact center  speech and call completion applications 
these applications are branded under the product name omvia voice framework and are scheduled for release in fiscal we will use these software platforms for deployment and management of enterprise  wireless and wireline network operator applications  which are designed to operate in both jee and microsoft s 
net enterprise computing environments 
third  we are developing media servers  voice browsers  and call processing infrastructure based on open standards such as salt  voicexml and ccxml 
these media servers are voip enabled  allowing operation in soft switch and hybrid pstn and voip networks 
finally  we are developing packaged  speech enabled applications for the network operator and enterprise markets 
these include a range of vertical and horizontal applications that are designed to greatly enhance customer return on investment by providing many commonly used  configurable functions that can be deployed more quickly than can custom applications 
certain of these applications are currently available under the product name omvia voice express 
additionally  we are developing modular productivity and communications applications for wireless and fixed line applications including speech driven voice mail  voice activated dialing  and enhanced personal information management 
the network products are branded under the product name omvia media exchange and are scheduled for release in fiscal we expect to maintain a strong commitment to research and development so that we can remain at the forefront of technology development in our markets 
proprietary rights we believe our existing patent  copyright  license and other proprietary rights in our products and technologies are material to the conduct of our business 
to protect these proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other proprietary rights laws  nondisclosure safeguards and license agreements 
as of february   we owned patents  of which were received during fiscal  and had pending applications for patents in the united states 
in addition  we have registered intervoice as a trademark in the united states  along with other registered trademarks and service marks 
some of our patents and marks are also registered in certain foreign countries 
we also have registered copyrights in the united states 
our software and other products are generally licensed to a customer under the terms of a nontransferable license agreement that restricts the use of the software and other products to the customer s internal purposes 
although our license agreements prohibit a customer from disclosing proprietary information contained in our products to any other person  it is technologically possible for our competitors to copy aspects of our products in violation of our rights 
furthermore  even in cases where we hold patents  the detection and policing of the unauthorized use of the patented technology is difficult 
moreover  judicial enforcement of copyrights may be uncertain  particularly in foreign countries 
the unauthorized use of our proprietary information by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we provide our customers a qualified indemnity against the infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
from time to time  various owners of patents and copyrighted works send us or our customers letters alleging that our products do or might infringe upon the owner s intellectual property rights  and or suggesting that we or our customers should negotiate a license or cross license agreement with the owner 
our policy is to never knowingly infringe upon any third party s intellectual property rights 
accordingly  we forward any such allegation or licensing request to our outside legal counsel for their review and opinion 
we generally attempt to resolve any such matter by informing the owner of our position concerning non infringement or invalidity  and or  if appropriate  negotiating a license or cross license agreement 
even though we attempt to resolve these matters without litigation  it is always possible that the owner of a patent or copyrighted work will sue us 
although no such litigation is currently pending against us  owners of patents and or copyrighted works have previously sued us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights  
as noted above  we currently have a portfolio of patents  and have applied for and will continue to apply for and receive a number of additional patents to protect our technological innovations 
we believe our patent portfolio could allow us to assert counterclaims for infringement against certain owners of intellectual property rights if those owners were to sue us for infringement 
in certain situations  it might be beneficial for us to 
table of contents cross license certain of our patents for other patents which are relevant to the call automation industry 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain patent matters 
see cautionary disclosures to qualify forward looking statements in item for a discussion of risks associated with claims of intellectual property infringement 
manufacturing and facilities our manufacturing operations consist primarily of the final assembly  integration and extensive testing of subassemblies  host computer platforms  operating software and our run time software 
we currently use third parties to perform printed circuit board assembly  sheet metal fabrication and customer site service and repair 
although we generally use standard parts and components for our products  some of our components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  we license speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
as we continue to migrate to open  standards based systems  we will become increasingly dependent on our component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner  and we expect to continue to be able to do so 
nevertheless  if our significant vendors are unable to supply components or licenses at current levels  we may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
in such situations  we would be unable to provide products and services to our customers or generate historical operating margins  and our business and operating results would suffer

katz technology licensing lp raktl has sent letters to certain of our customers suggesting that the customer should negotiate a license agreement to cover the practice of certain patents owned by raktl 
in the letters  raktl has alleged that certain of its patents pertain to 
table of contents certain enhanced services offered by network providers  including prepaid card and wireless services and postpaid card services 
raktl has further alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain call processing applications  including applications for call centers that route calls using a called party s dnis identification number 
as a result of the correspondence  many of our customers have had discussions  or are in discussions  with raktl 
we offer certain products that can be programmed and configured to provide enhanced services to network providers and call processing applications for call centers 
our contracts with customers usually include a qualified obligation to indemnify and defend customers against claims that products as delivered by intervoice infringe a third party s patent 
none of our customers have notified us that raktl has claimed that any product provided by intervoice infringes any claims of any raktl patent 
accordingly  we have not been required to defend any customers against a claim of infringement under an raktl patent 
we have  however  received letters from customers notifying us of the efforts by raktl to license its patent portfolio and reminding us of our potential obligations under the indemnification provisions of our agreements in the event that a claim is asserted 
in response to correspondence from raktl  a few customers have attempted to tender to us the defense of our products under contractual indemnity provisions 
we have informed these customers that while we fully intend to honor any contractual indemnity provisions  we do not believe we currently have any obligation to provide such a defense because raktl does not appear to have made a claim that an intervoice product infringes a patent 
some of these customers have disagreed with us and believe that the correspondence from raktl can be construed as claims against intervoice products 
some of our customers have licensed certain rights under the raktl patent portfolio 
one such customer who attempted to tender the defense of its products to us informed us that the customer had entered into an agreement to license certain rights under the raktl patents and demanded we indemnify the customer for unspecified amounts  including attorney s fees  paid in connection with the license agreement 
we notified the customer over months ago that we believe we do not have any indemnity obligation in connection with the license agreement 
we received no further response from the customer 
even though no claims have been made that a specific product offered by intervoice infringes any claim under the raktl patent portfolio  we have received opinions from our outside patent counsel that certain products and applications we offer do not infringe certain claims of the raktl patents 
we have also received opinions from our outside counsel that certain claims under the raktl patent portfolio are invalid or unenforceable 
furthermore  based on the reviews by outside counsel  we are not aware of any valid and enforceable claims under the raktl portfolio that are infringed by our products 
if we do become involved in litigation in connection with the raktl patent portfolio  under a contractual indemnity or any other legal theory  we intend to vigorously contest the claims and to assert appropriate defenses 
we have received letters from webley systems webley  a division of parus holdings  inc parus  and their counsel alleging that certain webley patents cover one or more of our products and services

based on reviews by outside counsel  we are not aware of any valid and enforceable claims under the webley patents that are infringed by our products or services 
pending litigation david barrie  et al  on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v 
intervoice brite  inc  et al  no 
cv d  pending in the united states district court  northern district of texas  dallas division several related class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas on behalf of purchasers of our common stock of intervoice during the period from october  through june  the class period 
plaintiffs have filed claims  which were consolidated into one proceeding  under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and the securities and exchange commission rule b against us as well as certain named current and former officers and directors of intervoice on behalf of the alleged class members 
in the complaint  plaintiffs claim that we and the named current and former officers and directors issued false and misleading statements during 
table of contents the class period concerning the financial condition of intervoice  the results of the merger with brite and the alleged future business projections of intervoice 
plaintiffs have asserted that these alleged statements resulted in artificially inflated stock prices 
we believe that we and our officers complied with our obligations under the securities laws  and we have vigorously defended the lawsuit 
we responded to this complaint by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint in the consolidated proceeding 
we asserted that the complaint lacked the degree of specificity and factual support to meet the pleading standards applicable to federal securities litigation 
on this basis  we requested that the united states district court for the northern district of texas dismiss the complaint in its entirety 
plaintiffs responded to our request for dismissal 
on august   the court entered an order granting our motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit 
in the order dismissing the lawsuit  the court granted plaintiffs an opportunity to reinstate the lawsuit by filing an amended complaint 
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which the court dismissed on september  plaintiffs appealed the district court decision to the fifth circuit court of appeals 
on january   the fifth circuit court of appeals issued an opinion in which it affirmed  in part  the district court s order of dismissal 
the court of appeals opinion also reversed a limited number of issues in the district court s proceedings 
on february   we filed a motion for rehearing with the fifth circuit court of appeals requesting the court to modify its opinion 
on may   the fifth circuit court of appeals denied our petition for rehearing but modified its opinion to clarify the court s decision 
the case has been remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the fifth circuit s opinion 
we continue to believe that we and our officers and directors complied with the securities laws and will continue to vigorously defend the portions of the case that have been remanded to the district court 
audit committee investigation in december  our audit committee completed an investigation it had begun in august of certain transactions occurring during our fiscal years through the audit committee was assisted in its investigation by separate independent legal counsel and a national accounting firm 
the audit committee reported the results of the investigation to  and we are cooperating with  the sec 
we are currently providing documents to the sec in response to a subpoena requesting information about the transactions that were the subject of the investigation 
our audit committee and its counsel are actively monitoring our response to the sec  and they have been conducting a review of certain documents provided to the sec which we located after the committee s original investigation 
intervoice is also honoring our pre existing obligation to indemnify two former officers of intervoice who received subpoenas from the sec in connection with the investigation 
the audit committee investigation found that we accounted for certain transactions incorrectly during our fiscal years through the audit committee investigation concluded that a  payment made by intervoice to a publicly held supplier purportedly for certain prepaid licenses was linked to an agreement to amend a warrant issued to us by the supplier to permit our cashless exercise of the warrant 
as a result  we believe the  payment should have been recorded as a reduction in the million gain we recognized on the sale of the shares underlying the warrant during the fourth quarter of fiscal and should not have been recorded as prepaid license inventory 
our payment to the supplier may have rendered unavailable a nonexclusive registration exemption for the sale of the shares underlying the warrant 
the audit committee investigation also found that we intentionally provided the same supplier false or misleading documents for such supplier to use to support such supplier s improper recognition of revenue in calendar in addition  the audit committee investigation and review found that six of the seven customer sales transactions the committee investigated were accounted for incorrectly and that there was intentional misconduct in at least one of those sales transactions 
these six transactions occurred at the end of quarters in which we just met analysts expectations with respect to earnings per share 
the audit committee found that we improperly recognized revenue in a quarter end barter transaction involving approximately of annual revenues for fiscal  and that we improperly accelerated the recognition of revenue in five quarter end 
table of contents transactions totaling approximately and of annual revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
separately  the audit committee further determined that in september one of our current executive officers improperly communicated intervoice information to a shareholder 
intervoice s management has concluded  with the concurrence of the audit committee and our external auditors  that restatement of our prior period financial statements to adjust for the findings of the audit committee investigation and review is not necessary 
in reaching this conclusion  we considered the impact of the incorrect accounting on each of the periods affected  the ages of the affected financial statements and the lack of any material changes in prior period trends as a result of the incorrect accounting 
in addition  we noted that since the date of the most recent transaction reviewed in the investigation  we have restructured our business  made significant management changes  consolidated our physical operations  significantly reduced our fixed operating costs and refinanced and repaid all of our major debt obligations 
we cannot predict whether we may have future losses relating to the matters investigated by the audit committee as a result of future claims  if any  including any claims by the government

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary disclosures to qualify forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report regarding our financial position  business strategy  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future sales  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  we caution current and potential investors that the following important risk factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause such results during fiscal and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of intervoice we are prone to quarterly sales fluctuations 
the sales value of an individual order for our solutions and services can range from a few thousand dollars to several million dollars depending on the complexity of our customer s business need and the size of its operations 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in our quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are often unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
in addition  some of our sales transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
our accuracy in estimating future sales is largely dependent on our ability to successfully qualify  estimate and close solution sales from our pipeline of sales opportunities during a quarter 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
the accuracy of our estimate of future sales is also dependent on our ability to accurately estimate the amount of revenue to be contributed from beginning backlog and revenue from cash basis customers during any fiscal quarter 
this estimate can be affected by factors outside our control  including changes in project timing requested by our customers 
accordingly  our actual sales for any fiscal reporting period may be significantly different than any estimate of sales we make for such period 
see the discussion entitled sales in this item for a discussion of our system for estimating sales and trends in our business 
we are subject to potential and pending lawsuits and other claims 
we are subject to certain potential and pending lawsuits and other claims discussed in item legal proceedings of part i of this annual report on form k 
we believe the pending lawsuit to which we are subject is without merit  and we intend to defend the matter vigorously 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will prevail in this matter 
furthermore  we may become subject to claims  including claims by the government  or other adverse consequences arising from the findings of an audit committee investigation we completed in december we and two of our former officers are currently responding to sec subpoenas requesting information about the transactions that were the subject of the investigation 
any adverse judgment  penalty or settlement related to any lawsuit or other such claim could have consequences that would be material to our financial position or results of operations 
our insurance policies provide coverage for losses and expenses incurred by us and our current and former directors and officers in connection with claims made under the federal securities laws 
these policies  however  exclude losses and expenses related to the barrie class action lawsuit discussed in item and contain other customary provisions to limit or exclude coverage for certain losses and expenses 
we face intense competition based on product capabilities  and we experience ever increasing demands from our actual and prospective customers for our products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
our success is dependent  to a large degree  on our effectiveness in allocating resources to developing and 
table of contents improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by our current and prospective customers 
our success is also dependent  to a large degree  on our ability to implement arrangements with vendors of complementary product offerings so that we can provide our current and prospective customers greater functionality 
our principal competitors include genesys  avaya  nortel  edify  comverse technology  huawei and lucent technologies 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we have 
although we have committed substantial resources to enhance our existing products and to develop and market new products  there is no assurance we will be successful 
we may not be successful in transitioning our products and services to an open  standards based business model 
intervoice has historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software solutions using internally developed components to address our customers total business needs 
increasingly  the markets for our products are requiring a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s 
net environments utilizing voicexml and or salt standards 
such an open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  we believe we may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on our development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift will place new challenges on us to transition our products and to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled solutions 
the shift to open standards will also challenge us to accurately estimate the level of r d expenditures that will be necessary in future periods to comply with existing standards and  potentially  to migrate to new open standards 
if we are unsuccessful in resolving one or more of these challenges  our revenues and profitability could decline 
we may not be able to retain our customer base  and  in particular  our more significant customers 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to retain our significant customers 
the loss of one of our significant customers could negatively impact our operating results 
our installed base of customers generally is not contractually obligated to place further solutions orders with us or to extend their services contracts with us at the expiration of their current contracts 
we will be harmed if we lose key business and technical personnel 
we rely upon the services of a relatively small number of key technical  project management and senior management personnel  most of whom do not have employment contracts 
if we were to lose any of our key personnel  replacing them could be difficult and costly 
if we were unable to successfully and promptly replace such personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
our reliance on significant vendor relationships could result in significant expense or an inability to serve our customers if we lose these relationships 
although we generally use standard parts and components in our products  some of our components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  we license speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
as we continue to migrate to open  standards based systems  we will become increasingly dependent on our component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner and we expect to continue to be able to do so 
nevertheless  if our significant vendors are unable to supply components or licenses at current levels  we may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
in such instances  we would be unable to provide products and services to our customers or generate historical operating margins  and our business and operating results would suffer 

table of contents if third parties assert claims that our products or services infringe on their technology and related intellectual property rights  whether the claims are made directly against us or against our customers  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
we believe software and technology companies  including intervoice and others in our industry  increasingly may become subject to infringement claims 
such claims may require us to enter into costly license agreements or result in even more costly litigation 
to the extent a licensing arrangement is required  the arrangement may not be available at all  or  if available  may be very expensive or even prohibitively expensive 
as with any legal proceeding  there is no guarantee we will prevail in any litigation instituted against us asserting infringement of intellectual property rights 
to the extent we suffer an adverse judgment  we might have to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  repurchase infringing products from our customers in accordance with indemnity obligations  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to the intellectual property that has been infringed upon 
as with licensing arrangements  non infringing substitute technologies may not be available and  if available  may be very expensive  or even prohibitively expensive  to implement 
accordingly  for all of the foregoing reasons  a claim of infringement could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to risks related to our international operations that could increase our costs and hurt our business 
our products are currently sold in more than countries 
our international sales were of total sales in each of fiscal  and international sales  personnel and property are subject to certain risks  including terrorism  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  greater difficulty in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights  general economic and political conditions in each country  loss of revenue  property and equipment from expropriation  import and export licensing requirements  and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  including risks arising from differences in language and cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
our inability to meet contracted performance targets could subject us to significant penalties 
many of our contracts  particularly for managed services  foreign contracts and contracts with telecommunication companies  include provisions for the assessment of liquidated damages for delayed project completion and or for our failure to achieve certain minimum service levels 
we have had to pay liquidated damages in the past and may have to pay additional liquidated damages in the future 
any such future liquidated damages could be significant 
increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and financial industries could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
the majority of our largest customers are in the telecommunications and financial industries 
these industries are undergoing significant consolidation as a result of merger and acquisition activity 
this activity could result in a decrease in the number of customers purchasing our products and or in delayed purchases of our products by customers that are reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a pending merger or acquisition 
if these results occur  our revenues and profitability could decline

critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we use estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and that may vary from actual results 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition intervoice recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware and software solutions  from the delivery of recurring maintenance and other customer services associated with installed solutions and from the provision of our enterprise and network solutions on a managed service basis 
our policies for revenue recognition follow the guidance in statement of position no 
software revenue recognition  as amended sop  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab and eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if contracts include multiple elements  each element of the arrangement is separately identified and accounted for based on the relative fair value of such element as evidenced by vendor specific objective evidence 
revenue is not recognized on any element of the arrangement if undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
sale of hardware and software solutions many of our sales are of customized software or customized hardware software solutions 
such solutions incorporate newly designed software and or standard building blocks of hardware and software which have been significantly modified  configured and assembled to match unique customer requirements defined at the beginning of each project 
we account for sales of these customized solutions using contract accounting principles under either the percentage of completion poc or completed contract methodology as further described below 
in other instances  particularly in situations where we sell to distributors or where we are supplying only additional product capacity ie  similar hardware and software solutions to what is already in place for an existing customer  we may sell solutions that do not require significant customization 
in those situations  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
typically  this is at shipment when there is no installation obligation or at the completion of minor post shipment installation obligations 
generally  we use poc accounting for our more complex custom solutions 
in determining whether a particular sale qualifies for poc treatment  we consider multiple factors including the value of the contract and the degree of customization inherent in the project 
projects normally must have an aggregate value of more than  to qualify for poc treatment 
for a project accounted for under the poc method  we recognize revenue as work progresses over the life of the project based on a comparison of actual labor hours to current estimates of total labor hours required to complete the project 
we review and update project estimates on a quarterly basis 
the terms of most poc projects require customers to make interim progress payments during the course of the project 
these payments and a written customer acknowledgement at the completion of the project  usually following a final customer test phase  document the customer s acceptance of the project 
in some circumstances  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the system in a live operating environment may also constitute final acceptance of a project 
we use completed contract accounting for smaller custom projects not meeting the poc thresholds described above 
we also use completed contract accounting in situations where the technical requirements of a project are so complex or are so dependent on the development of new technologies or the unique application of existing technologies that our ability to make reasonable estimates is in doubt or in situations where a sale is subject to unusual inherent hazards 
such hazards are unrelated to  or only incidentally related to  our typical activities and include situations where the enforceability of a contract is suspect  completion of the contract is subject to pending litigation  or where the solutions produced are subject to condemnation or expropriation risks 
these latter situations are extremely rare 
for all completed contract sales  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance as evidenced by a written customer acknowledgement  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the solution in a live operating environment 
we generate a significant percentage of our sales  particularly sales of enhanced telecommunications services solutions  outside the united states 
customers in certain countries are subject to significant economic and political challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  we may offer selected customers such payment terms 
in all cases  however  we only recognize revenue at such time as our solutions or service fee is fixed or determinable  
table of contents collectibility is probable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in some limited cases  this policy causes us to recognize revenue on a cash basis  limiting revenue recognition on certain sales of solutions and or services to the actual cash received to date from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
costs associated with our services to cash basis customers are expensed as we incur them 
sale of maintenance and other customer services we recognize revenue from maintenance and other customer services when the services are performed or ratably over the related contract period 
all significant costs and expenses associated with maintenance contracts are expensed as incurred 
this approximates a ratable recognition of expenses over the contract period 
sale of managed services we provide enhanced communications solutions to some customers on an outsourced basis through our managed service business 
while specific arrangements can vary  we generally build a customized solution to address a specific customer s business needs and then own  monitor  and maintain that system  ensuring that it processes the customer s business transactions in accordance with defined specifications 
for our services  we generally receive a one time setup fee paid at the beginning of the contract and a service fee paid monthly over the life of the contract 
most contracts range from to months in length 
we combine the setup fee and the total service fee to be received from the customer and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the managed service contract 
we capitalize the cost of the computer system s and related applications used to provide the service and depreciate such costs over the contract life for assets unique to the individual contract or the life of the equipment for assets common to the general managed service operations or for assets whose useful lives are shorter than the related contract term 
we expense all labor and other period costs required to provide the service as we incur them 
loss contracts we update our estimates of the costs necessary to complete all customer contracts in process on a quarterly basis 
whenever current estimates indicate that we will incur a loss on the completion of a contract  we immediately record a provision for such loss as part of the current period cost of goods sold 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
inventories are recorded at standard cost which approximates actual cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically review our inventories for unsaleable or obsolete items and for items held in excess quantities based on current and projected usage 
we make adjustments where necessary to reduce the carrying value of individual items to reflect the lower of cost or market  and any such adjustments create a new carrying value for the affected items 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets intangible assets are comprised of separately identifiable intangible assets arising out of our fiscal acquisition of brite voice systems  inc  and certain capitalized purchased software 
we amortize intangible assets using the straight line method over each asset s estimated useful life 
such lives range from to years 
we review our intangible assets for possible impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with such assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets 
in those situations  we recognize an impairment loss on the intangible asset equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value  generally based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
we expense the cost of internally developed software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products for sale until technological feasibility is established  after which point any additional costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility of a computer software product is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
no costs have been capitalized to date for internally developed software products and enhancements as our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of 
table of contents technological feasibility 
we capitalize purchased software upon acquisition when such software is technologically feasible or if it has an alternative future use  such as use of the software in different products or resale of the purchased software 
goodwill goodwill is also attributable to our fiscal purchase of brite voice systems  inc under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted on march   goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to annual amortization 
we do  however  perform an impairment test on our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis and more frequently if we identify triggering events on an interim basis 
our impairment review follows the two step approach defined in sfas no 
the first step compares the fair value of intervoice with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the lesser of that excess or the carrying amount of goodwill 
income taxes we recognize deferred income taxes using the liability method and reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in circumstances where we do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
this is a highly subjective assessment and requires us to evaluate the predictability of future taxable income while considering the significant losses we incurred in fiscal and in general  we anticipate reversing valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets of our us and us operations only when the underlying deferred tax assets are realized or at the time the respective taxable entities actual results have demonstrated a sustained profitability and their projected results support our ability to realize the deferred tax assets currently being reserved 
sales intervoice is a leading provider of converged voice and data solutions and related services 
as used in this report  solutions sales include the sale of hardware and or software applications and the related professional services associated with designing  integrating  and installing custom applications to address customers business needs 
recurring services include a suite of maintenance and software upgrade offerings and the provision of customized solutions to customers on a managed service outsourced basis 
our solutions product line includes voice automation ivr  network portal  messaging  and payment solutions 
in fiscal and prior years  we grouped sales made to network market customers in a single network solutions category 
beginning in fiscal  we determined that product line distinction provided the most meaningful breakdown of quarterly and annual sales activity and began capturing and reporting our activity in that manner 
we are not able to provide the historical breakdown of network solution sales into portal  messaging and payment solutions components 

table of contents our sales by product line for fiscal  and were as follows in millions voice automation ivr solution sales network portal solution sales messaging solution sales payment solution sales network solution sales total solution sales maintenance and related services revenues managed services revenues total recurring services revenues total sales we assign revenues to geographic locations based on the location of the customer 
our net sales by geographic area for fiscal years  and were as follows in millions north america europe middle east and africa central and south america pacific rim total international sales constituted of total sales in fiscal  and total sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal when compared to sales of the preceding year 
the increase in sales in fiscal was comprised of a increase in solutions sales and a increase in recurring services revenues 
our fiscal sales of voice automation ivr solutions grew approximately  and sales of network portal solutions grew approximately  but such growth was offset by continuing softness in sales of messaging and payment solutions which decreased approximately and as compared to fiscal levels  respectively 
voice automation ivr sales in fiscal included approximately million recognized under an million sale to a major us wireless provider that is being accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
the increase in recurring services revenues is made up of growth of approximately in the sales of maintenance and related services and a reduction of approximately in managed services revenues 
one customer that purchased approximately million of maintenance services during fiscal has notified us that it will not renew its maintenance contracts in fiscal managed services revenues during fiscal included million relating to services performed for an international managed services customer for which we recognize revenue on a cash basis 
we recognized million of similar sales to the same customer in fiscal at february   this customer owed us approximately million for services performed but not recognized as revenue through that date 
in addition  we have contracted to provide services totaling approximately million from march through november our ability to recognize these amounts or any future amounts to be earned under contracts with this customer as revenue and the timing of any such revenue recognition are uncertain 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal to  including particularly the devaluation of the us dollar as compared to the british pound  served to increase sales for fiscal by approximately million 
similar changes from fiscal to fiscal served to increase sales for fiscal by approximately million 
changes to such exchange rates between fiscal and had no material effect on fiscal sales 

table of contents the increase in sales in fiscal over fiscal levels was comprised of a decrease in solutions sales and a increase in recurring services revenues 
the decrease in our fiscal solution sales resulted from the continuing softness in sales of our network market products which decreased approximately as compared to fiscal levels 
the increase in recurring services revenues was made up of growth of approximately in the sales of maintenance and related services and growth of approximately in managed services revenues 
the managed services growth was primarily attributable to the increase in cash receipts from the international managed services customer as discussed above 
we have historically made significant sales of solutions  customer services and managed services to o such combined sales accounted for of our total sales during fiscal and and of our total sales during fiscal no other customer accounted for or more of our sales during such periods 
sales under one long term managed services contract with o totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we announced that this contract  which otherwise would have ended in july had been extended through july at current exchange rates  the contract is expected to yield managed service revenues of approximately million per month through july and approximately million per month from august to july we are prone to quarterly sales fluctuations 
some of our transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in our quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
we use a system combining estimated sales from our recurring services contracts  pipeline of solution sales opportunities  and backlog of committed solution orders to estimate sales and trends in our business 
for the years ended february   february  and february  sales were sourced as follows year ended february based on averages of quarterly activity sales from recurring service and support contracts  including contracts for managed services sales from solutions backlog sales from the pipeline our service and support contracts range in original duration from one month to five years  with most managed service contracts having initial terms of two to three years and most maintenance and related contracts having initial terms of one year 
because many of the longer duration contracts give customers early cancellation privileges  we do not consider our book of services contracts to be reportable backlog  as a portion of the potential revenue reflected in the contract values may never be realized 
nevertheless  it is easier for us to estimate service and support sales than to estimate solution sales for the next quarter because the service and support contracts generally span multiple quarters and revenues recognized under each contract are generally similar from one quarter to the next 
our backlog is made up of customer orders for solutions for which we have received complete purchase orders and which we expect to ship within twelve months 
at february   and  our backlog of solutions sales was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our ability to estimate the amount of backlog that will be converted to revenue in any fiscal quarter can be affected by factors outside our control  including changes in project timing requested by our customers 
our pipeline of opportunities for solutions sales is the aggregation of our sales opportunities for which we have not received a purchase order  with each opportunity evaluated for the date the potential customer will make a purchase decision  competitive risks  and the potential amount of any resulting sale 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
while this pipeline may provide us some sales guidelines in our business planning and budgeting  pipeline estimates are 
table of contents necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to solutions sales in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
while we know the amount of solutions backlog available at the beginning of a quarter  we must speculate on our pipeline of solutions opportunities for the quarter 
our accuracy in estimating total solutions sales for future fiscal quarters is  therefore  highly dependent upon our ability to successfully estimate which pipeline opportunities will close during the quarter 
to compete effectively in our target markets in fiscal and beyond  we believe we must continue to transition our products and services to an open  standards based business model 
we have historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software systems using internally developed components to address our customers total business needs 
increasingly  the markets for our products are requiring a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s 
net environments utilizing voicexml and or salt standards 
such an open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  we believe we may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on our development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift will place new challenges on our management to transition our products and to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled systems 
special charges fiscal during fiscal  we incurred severance charges of approximately million in connection with a reduction in workforce affecting positions 
in addition  we incurred cash and non cash charges totaling approximately million and million  respectively  under the terms of a separation agreement with our former chief financial officer who resigned to pursue other opportunities 
the following table summarizes the effect on reported operating results by financial statement category of all special charge activities for fiscal in millions 
selling  cost of research and general and goods sold development administrative total severance payments and related benefits separation settlement total all cash charges related to these special charges have been paid 
fiscal during fiscal  we continued to implement actions designed to lower cost and improve operational efficiency in response to continued softness in the primary markets for our products 
we also reviewed our intangible assets for evidence of impairment in light of changes in our business and continued weakness in the world wide telecommunications networks markets 
see amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

table of contents the following table summarizes the effect on reported operating results by financial statement category of all special charges activities for fiscal in millions 
cost of research other impairment of goods sold development sg a expenses intangibles total write down of intangible assets severance payments and related benefits facilities closures write down of excess inventories costs associated with loss contracts loss on early extinguishment of debt total the severance and related costs recognized during fiscal related to three separate workforce reductions that affected a total of employees 
one of the reductions was associated with the consolidation of our separate enterprise and networks divisions into a single  integrated organizational structure 
the charge also included costs associated with the resignation of the networks division president during the first quarter of fiscal costs related to facilities closures included million for the closure of our leased facility in chicago  illinois  and million associated with the closure of a portion of our leased facilities in manchester  united kingdom 
the downsizing of the leased space in manchester followed from our decision to consolidate virtually all of our manufacturing operations into our dallas  texas facilities 
the inventory adjustments reflected our continued assessment of our inventory levels in light of sales projections  the decision to eliminate the uk manufacturing operation and the consolidation of the business units 
the charges for loss contracts reflected the costs incurred on two contracts which were expected to result in net losses to intervoice upon completion 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt included million in non cash charges to write off unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issue costs and million in prepayment premiums 
all cash charges related to these special charges have been paid 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million of sales  million of sales and million of sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal and  we incurred special charges to cost of goods sold totaling million of sales and million of sales  respectively  as described in the preceding special charges section 
a significant portion of our cost of goods sold is comprised of labor costs that are fixed over the near term as opposed to direct material and license royalty costs that vary directly with sales volume 
the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from our ability to increase our sales volume without incurring proportional increases in our fixed labor costs 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from the reduction in special charges between years  the ongoing benefit in fiscal of our fiscal cost cutting initiatives and the effect of significantly greater cash basis managed service revenues recognized in fiscal research and development research and development expenses during fiscal   and were approximately million of sales  million of sales  and million of sales  respectively 
we incurred special charges of million of sales and million of sales in fiscal and  respectively  as described in special charges above 
expenses were down in fiscal from prior year levels as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and as a result of the reassignment of certain resources from r d to direct customer service activities cost of goods sold in connection with our fiscal reorganization 
recurring research and development expenses included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 

table of contents intervoice s research and development spending is focused in four key areas 
first  we are developing software tools to aid in the development and deployment of customer applications incorporating speech recognition  text to speech  and other rich media technologies for enterprises and wireless and wireline providers 
next  we are developing server based application software platforms for operations and management of contact center  speech and call completion applications 
these applications are branded under the product name omvia voice framework and are scheduled for release in fiscal we will use these software platforms for deployment and management of enterprise  wireless and wireline network operator applications which are designed to operate in both jee and microsoft s 
net enterprise computing environments 
third  we are developing media servers  voice browsers  and call processing infrastructure based on open standards such as salt  voicexml  and ccxml 
these media servers are voip enabled  allowing operation in soft switch and hybrid pstn and voip networks 
finally  we are developing packaged  speech enabled applications for the network operator and enterprise markets 
these include a range of vertical and horizontal applications that are designed to greatly enhance customer return on investment by providing many commonly used  configurable functions that can be deployed more quickly than can custom applications 
certain of these applications are currently available under the product name omvia voice express 
additionally  we are developing modular productivity and communications applications for wireless and wireline applications including speech driven voice mail  voice activated dialing  and enhanced personal information management 
the network products are branded under the product name omvia media exchange and are scheduled for release in fiscal we expect to maintain a strong commitment to research and development so that we can remain at the forefront of technology development in our business markets 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million of sales  million of sales  and million of sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we incurred sg a charges in connection with the audit committee investigation described in item of part of this form k of approximately million  or of total sales  during fiscal sg a expenses included special charges of million of sales in fiscal and million of sales in fiscal  as described in special charges above 
sg a expenses declined in fiscal from prior year levels primarily as a result of cost control initiatives implemented by the company 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets in connection with our purchase of brite in fiscal  we recorded intangible assets and goodwill totaling million 
these assets were assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
for the fiscal years ended february   and  we recognized amortization and impairment expense related to these assets as follows in millions amortization of acquisition related intangible assets impairment of acquisition related intangible assets as described below total amortization and impairment charged to operating income impairment of goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
as described below effective march   we adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets the statements 
statement no 
refines the definition of what assets may be considered as separately identified intangible assets apart from goodwill 
statement no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis 

table of contents in adopting the statements  we first reclassified million of intangible assets associated with our assembled workforce net of related deferred taxes of million to goodwill because such assets did not meet the new criteria for separate identification 
we then allocated our adjusted goodwill balance of million to our then existing enterprise and networks divisions and completed the transitional impairment tests required by statement no 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a combination of the expected present values of future cash flows and an assessment of comparable market values 
as a result of these tests  we determined that the goodwill associated with our networks division was fully impaired  and  accordingly  we recognized a non cash  goodwill impairment charge of million as the cumulative effect on prior years of this change in accounting principle 
this impairment resulted primarily from the significant decline in networks sales and profitability during the fourth quarter of fiscal and related reduced forecasts for the division s sales and profitability 
effective august   we combined our divisions into a single integrated organizational structure in order to address changing market demands and global customer requirements 
we conducted our required annual test of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarters of fiscal  and no additional impairment of goodwill was indicated 
accordingly  at february   our remaining goodwill totaled million 
during fiscal  we were adversely affected by continuing softness in the general us economy  by extreme softness in the worldwide network telecommunications market and by political tensions in parts of south america and the middle east 
we experienced a second year of declining network revenue and significantly reduced our estimates of near term growth in revenue and net income for our networks based products 
as a result  we determined that a triggering event  as defined in sfas no 
 had occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  we evaluated our intangible assets for evidence of impairment 
based on the results of our review  we recognized impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of our customer relations and developed technology intangible assets to their respective fair values 
these fair values were based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
during fiscal  we completed the amortization of our developed technology intangible assets 
at february   we had million in remaining net intangible assets other than goodwill which will be subject to amortization in future periods 
the estimated amortization expense attributable to our intangible assets for each of the next five years is as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal other income expense other income expense during fiscal  and was comprised primarily of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and foreign currency transaction losses totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense we incurred interest expense of approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
substantially all of this expense related to our long term borrowings initially obtained in connection with the brite merger and subsequently refinanced 
the reduction in interest expense from fiscal through fiscal is primarily attributable to the lower levels of debt outstanding in successive years as we made scheduled and discretionary payments of principal 
interest expense also declined because we were able to negotiate lower interest rates when we refinanced our debt in fiscal and borrowings under all credit agreements totaled million  million and million at february   and  respectively 
in march  we repaid the remaining million of debt 

table of contents income taxes we recognized income tax expense of million of pretax income for fiscal and million of pretax income for fiscal we recognized an income tax benefit of million of pretax loss for fiscal the fiscal and percentages differ from the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of the taxability in the us of certain dividends deemed to have been received from our foreign subsidiaries  the use of certain fully reserved net operating loss carryforwards and other fully reserved deferred tax assets as further described below and the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies 
the fiscal percentage differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of benefits recognized in fiscal as a result of a change in us tax laws  operating losses and credit carryforwards generated but not benefited  and an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our us taxable income for fiscal and included distributions deemed to have been made to our us company by several of our foreign subsidiaries  including  particularly  our uk subsidiary 
such deemed distributions stemmed from the existence and ultimate settlement of intercompany debt owed by the us entity to certain of our foreign subsidiaries and from the pledging of certain uk assets as collateral for a term loan that was outstanding for a portion of fiscal during fiscal and  we used net operating losses carried forward from previous years and the reversal of certain temporary differences to offset virtually all of our us taxable income 
as a result  our current tax expense was limited to a small amount of us alternative minimum tax expense and to tax expense on our international operations 
the reversal of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances offset the deferred tax expense we would otherwise have incurred as a result of using the assets  and  as a result  our overall effective tax rate for the year was substantially less than the statutory rates 
tax expense for fiscal also reflected the benefit of a million favorable tax settlement with a foreign government reached during the year 
during fiscal  we reached final settlement with the internal revenue service regarding audits of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and in the settlement  we lost the ability to carry back approximately million in net operating losses generated in fiscal and repaid approximately million of refunds previously received from the irs plus approximately million in accrued interest 
the final settlements had been anticipated in our fiscal net tax provision and had no material effect on the tax provision or net income for fiscal during fiscal  our wholly owned subsidiary  brite voice systems  inc brite  reached final settlement with the irs regarding a disputed notice of deficiency relating to brite s august federal income tax return 
as a result of the settlement  we reversed approximately million of taxes payable we had accrued in prior years in response to the irs challenge 
during fiscal  united states tax law was amended to allow companies which incurred net operating losses in and to carry such losses back a maximum of five years instead of the maximum of two years previously allowed 
as a result of this change  during the first quarter of fiscal  we used million of our then existing net operating loss carryforwards and million of our then existing tax credit carryforwards and recognized a one time tax benefit of million  of which million was recognized as additional capital associated with previous stock option exercises 
also during fiscal  we became aware of the audit issues described above associated with our fiscal and us tax returns and recorded a charge of approximately million as part of our tax provision for the year 
during fiscal  we recognized tax expense totaling million to increase our valuation allowance for net foreign deferred tax assets that existed at february  we had not previously provided a valuation allowance for deferred assets associated with our foreign subsidiaries 
also during fiscal  we reduced our deferred tax liabilities by million in connection with the reclassification of our assembled workforce intangible asset to goodwill 
as a result of this transaction  we increased the valuation allowance associated with our us net deferred tax asset by million 
at february   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling million 
this amount  if not used  will expire beginning in fiscal virtually all of the net operating loss carryforwards 
table of contents arose from employee stock option exercises 
as a result  the use of such carryforwards in fiscal and future years will increase equity and will not reduce our us tax provision for those years 
we also had million  million and million in us research and development  us and uk foreign tax and uk alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  respectively 
if unused  the foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal during fiscal and  we established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  including those arising from our net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
although we earned a profit in fiscal and and were able to use some previously reserved deferred tax assets  we believe the existence of substantive losses in our us operations in fiscal and and the dependency of our international subsidiaries on continuing us operations prevent us from concluding that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
this is a highly subjective assessment that requires us to evaluate the predictability of future taxable income while considering the significant losses we incurred in fiscal and in general  we anticipate reversing valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets of our us and us operations only when the underlying deferred tax assets are realized or at the time the respective taxable entities actual results have demonstrated a sustained profitability and their projected results support our ability to realize the deferred tax assets currently being reserved 
in calculating a projected annual tax rate for fiscal or future years  we estimate the amount of deferred tax assets that will reverse during the year 
because we have a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as discussed above  the projected change in the level of temporary differences during the year affects our annualized rate calculation 
if the actual reversal of temporary differences differs from our estimate  our effective rate for the year will be affected  and the change in such rate could be significant 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides for a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal we have begun an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we have not reached a decision on whether or not the election will be beneficial to us 
the range of possible amounts we are considering for repatriation under the ajca is between and million 
the related potential range of income tax expense associated with the repatriation is between and million 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision during the third quarter of fiscal income loss from operations and net income loss we generated income from operations of million and net income of million during fiscal income from operations and net income were million and million during fiscal our loss from operations  loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and net loss totaled million  million and million  respectively in fiscal in fiscal  our increasing profitability resulted primarily from significant growth in our voice automation ivr and network portal sales  reduced interest expense resulting from significant reductions in debt  reduced amortization expense and a low effective tax rate 
in fiscal  we combined improvements in the overall economic environment  improving markets for our ivr and portal products  our focus on speech solutions and open architecture  our focus on our recurring services offerings and our multi year efforts to reduce operating cost and enhance efficiency to produce a return to profitability 
our losses in fiscal were primarily attributable to a significant decline in our sales volumes from prior year levels and to the significant restructuring and other special charges incurred in our efforts to adjust our operations to the rapidly changing market for our products 
in addition  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on prior years associated with our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a charge to income in fiscal of million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we had million in cash and cash equivalents at february   an increase of million over ending fiscal balances 
borrowings under our long term credit facilities totaled million at february   a reduction of million from fiscal ending balances 
operating cash flow for fiscal totaled million  the result of our solid profitability for the year and our continuing focus on balance sheet management 
our days sales outstanding of accounts receivable was days at february  for sales of certain of our more complex  customized solutions generally those with a sales price of  or more  we recognize revenue based on a percentage of completion methodology 
unbilled receivables accrued under this methodology totaled million of total net receivables at february   as compared to million of total receivables at february  we expect to bill and collect unbilled receivables as of february  within the next twelve months 
while we continue to focus on the level of our investment in accounts receivable  we generate a significant percentage of our sales  particularly sales of enhanced telecommunications services solutions  outside the united states 
customers in certain countries are subject to significant economic and political challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  we may offer selected customers such payment terms 
in all cases  however  we only recognize revenue at such time as our solution or service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in some limited cases  this policy may result in our recognizing revenue on a cash basis  limiting revenue recognition on certain sales of solutions and or services to the actual cash received to date from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
we used million of cash in net investing activities during fiscal of this amount  we used million to purchase equipment to expand our managed services business and the remainder for replacement and expansion of our computing infrastructure 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal during fiscal  our financing activities provided million in net cash flow 
our option holders exercised options for million shares of common stock and  in so doing  provided us with million of cash 
we used our improved financial condition to facilitate the refinancing of million outstanding under our mortgage loan and to obtain the release of million held as cash collateral under the line of credit 
we made scheduled debt payments of million and discretionary debt payments of million during the year 
in connection with a sale of convertible notes during fiscal  which notes were subsequently redeemed in full for cash prior to the fiscal year end  we issued warrants to the buyers 
the warrants gave the holders the right to purchase from us an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for per share 
in april  the warrant holders paid us million to purchase the full  shares available under the warrants 
line of credit in january  we entered into a credit agreement with a lender which provides for a revolving line of credit equal to the lesser of million or a defined borrowing base comprised of eligible us accounts receivable 
the credit agreement contains terms  conditions and representations that are generally customary for asset based credit facilities  including requirements that we comply with certain financial and operating covenants 
as of february   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by first liens on our accounts receivable  general intangibles  equipment and inventory and by a first lien on the real property and fixtures comprising our dallas headquarters building and fixtures 
we may borrow  partially or wholly repay our outstanding borrowings without penalty  and reborrow under the agreement so long as the total outstanding borrowings do not exceed the available borrowing base 

table of contents we had no amounts drawn under this line at february  the revolving line of credit agreement expires on january  in june  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with our lender that added an million term loan to our existing line of credit 
we used the proceeds of the new term loan to repay all amounts outstanding under our mortgage loan 
at february   we had million outstanding under the term loan 
we repaid the outstanding balance of the term loan in full in march summary of future obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of february   to be paid in fiscal through in millions payments due by period fiscal year ending february nature of commitment long term debt paid in full in march operating lease payments firm purchase commitments total obligations and commitments the operating lease payments shown above were our only off balance sheet arrangements at february  most of our purchases are executed under cancelable purchase orders 
the firm purchase commitments shown above are comprised of non cancelable commitments for certain communications charges and royalties 
we believe our cash reserves and internally generated cash flow along with any cash availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the next twelve months 
impact of inflation we do not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on our financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  we presently are not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts 
the absence of such contracts should reduce our exposure to inflationary effects

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities that generally have maturities of days or less 
the carrying value of these securities approximates market value  and there is no long term interest rate risk associated with these investments 
foreign currency risks we transact business in certain foreign currencies including  particularly  the british pound and the euro 
our primary software application development  research and development and other administrative activities are conducted from offices in the united states and the united kingdom  and our primary manufacturing operations are conducted in the united states 
virtually all sales arranged through our us offices are denominated in us dollars  which is the functional and reporting currency of our us entity 
sales arranged through our us subsidiary are denominated in various currencies  including the british pound  the us dollar and the euro  however  the us subsidiary s functional currency is the british pound 
for the fiscal year ended february   sales originating from our uk subsidiary represented approximately of consolidated sales 
as a result of our international operations  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not historically used foreign currency options or forward contracts to hedge our currency exposures because of variability in the timing of cash flows associated with our larger contracts  and we did not have any such hedge instruments in place at february  rather  we attempt to mitigate our foreign currency risk by generally transacting business in the functional currency of each of our major subsidiaries  thus creating natural hedges by paying expenses incurred in the local currency in which revenues will be received 
as noted above  our operating results are exposed to changes in certain exchange rates including  particularly  those between the us dollar  the british pound and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the other currencies  our sales are negatively affected upon the translation of uk operating results to the reporting currency 
the effect of these changes on our operating profits varies depending on the level of british pound denominated expenses and the uk subsidiary s overall profitability 
for the fiscal year ended february   the result of a hypothetical  uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound and the euro would have been a decrease in sales of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and or operating expenses  changes in exchange rates also could affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
