table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide enterprise content management software and services that enable businesses to create  review  manage  distribute and archive business content  such as documents  spreadsheets  e mails and presentations  as well as web images  graphics  content and applications code  across the enterprise and its value chain of customers  partners and suppliers 
our ecm platform consists of integrated software product offerings  delivering customers end to end content lifecycle management including collaboration  e mail management  imaging  digital asset management  web content management  document management and records management 
customers have deployed our products for business initiatives such as web content management  intranet management  marketing content management  collaborative portals  records management  deal management  matter centric collaboration and content provisioning 
to date  more than  enterprises  law firms and professional services organizations worldwide have licensed our software products 
we market and license our software products and services primarily through a direct sales force and augment our sales  marketing and service efforts through relationships with technology vendors  professional service firms  systems integrators and other strategic partners 
our revenues to date have been derived primarily from accounts in north america  revenues from outside of north america accounted for of our total revenues in we had employees as of december  in august  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of software intelligence 
in november  we completed our merger with imanage and  in june  we completed the acquisition of mediabin 
the results of operations of these business combinations have been included prospectively from the closing dates of these transactions through year end 
accordingly  our financial results are not directly comparable to those of the previous periods 
in particular  our consolidated results for include revenues and expenses for imanage for only one month and the results of mediabin for six months  while the consolidated results for include such revenues and expenses for these operations a full year 
on november   we effected a one for four reverse stock split 
all share and per share information included in these consolidated financial statements has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split 
results of operations in  our business was impacted by a sharp decline in customer spending on information technology initiatives both domestically and internationally and the information technology spending environment has remained weak throughout and our revenues were further affected by a shift away from spending on public facing web applications  such as our teamsite product  to internal productivity enhancing applications 
as a result of these factors  our revenues declined from to in response  we initiated and completed a series of strategic actions designed to expand our product offerings 
during  we acquired mediabin and imanage to extend our product offerings into digital asset management and collaborative document management  thereby creating product offerings that we believe address a larger market opportunity 
as a result of these actions  our revenues increased from to these business combinations also allowed us to achieve economies of scale in our sales  marketing  development and administrative functions 
we also completed a series of restructuring actions to help align our cost structure with expected revenues 
these restructuring actions included staff reductions in all functional areas of our business  decreases in marketing and promotional spending and the abandonment of certain facilities in excess of current and expected future needs 

table of contents revenues years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages license percentage of total revenues support and service percentage of total revenues total revenues increased from million in to million in we believe this increase was primarily attributable to sales of the worksite product  which we acquired in november as part of our merger with imanage  and the digital asset management products  which we acquired in june as part of our acquisition of mediabin 
total revenues decreased from million in to million in we believe this decrease was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in spending on information technology initiatives  particularly public facing web applications  which began in late and is ongoing 
our average license transaction size for sales in excess of  was   and  in  and  respectively 
sales outside of the united states of america represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect that reduced spending on information technology initiatives will continue to adversely affect our business for the foreseeable future and  to the extent that any improvement occurs  such an improvement may not be sustained 
license 
license revenues increased from million in to million in we believe this increase was primarily attributable to license revenues from the worksite product that we acquired in november and the digital asset management products that we acquired in june license revenues decreased from million in to million in we believe this decrease was attributable to weak economic conditions worldwide  resulting in reduced spending on information technology initiatives and a shift away from spending on public facing web applications like our teamsite product 
this decline was partially offset by license revenues from sales of the digital asset management products we acquired in june license revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
support and service 
support and service revenues increased from million in to million in we believe this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of imanage and mediabin  which provided a greater opportunity for consulting services and a larger installed base of customers purchasing support services 
support and service revenues decreased from million in to million in we believe this decrease was primarily attributable to fewer customer engagements as a result of declining license transactions  as well as price competition from third party system integrators for consulting services and shorter implementations due to the improved product design 
to the extent that our license revenues decline in the future  our support and service revenues may also decline 
specifically  a decline in license revenues may result in fewer consulting engagements 
additionally  since customer support contracts are generally sold with each license transaction  a decline in license revenues may also result in a decline in customer support revenues 
however  since customer support revenues are recognized over the duration of the support contract  the impact will lag a decline in license revenues 

table of contents cost of revenues years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages cost of license revenues percentage of license revenues percentage of total revenues cost of support and service revenues percentage of support and service revenues percentage of total revenues license 
cost of license revenues includes expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and documentation  as well as costs of licensing third party software embedded in or sold with our software products and amortization of purchased technology associated with business combinations 
cost of license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues and in absolute dollars from to was mainly due to the million increase in amortization of purchased technology associated with our business combinations 
the increases in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from to were attributable to an increase in royalties due to third parties  including royalties paid to imanage of million prior to the merger  and a million increase in amortization of purchased technology 
based only on acquisitions completed through the year end  we expect the amortization of purchased technology classified as a cost of license revenues to be million in  million in and  in we expect cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to vary from period to period depending on the mix of products sold  the extent to which third party software products are bundled with our products and the amount of overall license revenues  as many of the third party software products embedded with our software are under fixed fee arrangements 
support and service 
cost of support and service revenues consists of salary and personnel related expenses for our consulting  training and support personnel  costs associated with product updates to customers under active support contracts  subcontractor expenses and depreciation of equipment used in our services and customer support operation 
cost of support and service revenues increased to million in from million in  and decreased to million in from million in the increase in cost of support and service revenues from to was due primarily to higher subcontractor costs of million and higher personnel costs of million as a result of the acquisitions of imanage and mediabin 
the decrease in cost of support and service revenues from to was due primarily to lower personnel costs of million and lower travel costs of million 
cost of support and service revenues represented  and of support and service revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of related revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in support revenues as a percentage of total support and service revenues  as support revenues generally have higher gross margins than consulting services and training 
support and service headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
since our support and service revenues have lower gross margins than our license revenues  our overall gross margins typically decline if our support and service revenues increase as a percent of total revenues 
we expect cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of support and service revenues to vary from period to period  depending in part on whether the services are performed by our in house staff or subcontractors 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  benefits and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel and marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to million in higher commissions as a result of higher revenues  million increase in personnel costs  and a million in increased promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to a million reduction in personnel costs as a result of lower average headcount in the period  million in lower commissions as a result of lower revenues and a million reduction in promotional expenses 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses represented  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues from to was due primarily to economies of scale associated with our business combinations  while the decrease from to was due primarily to cost control efforts 
sales and marketing headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  will decrease slightly in from levels posted in due to expected economies of scale as a result of revenue growth 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of hiring of new sales and marketing personnel  our spending on marketing programs and the level of revenues  in particular license revenues  in each period 
research and development years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages research and development percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  third party contractors  facilities and related overhead costs associated with our product development and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs of million  a million increase in facilities expense and a  increase in third party contractor costs 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decline in personnel costs associated with headcount reductions 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
research and development headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in headcount in over was primarily due to our acquisition of imanage 
we expect research and development expenses in will decline slightly as a percentage of total revenues when compared to as we continue to manage our expenses and realize greater cost efficiencies in our product development activities 

table of contents general and administrative years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages general and administrative percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for general corporate functions including finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs partially offset by higher facilities costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decline in personnel costs and a  reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expense was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues from to was due primarily to cost savings synergies associated with our business combinations and cost control efforts 
general and administrative headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decline slightly as a percentage of total revenues in when compared to due to continued cost control efforts and economies of scale 
amortization of stock based compensation years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages amortization of stock based compensation percentage of total revenues we recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted prior to our initial public offering and in connection with stock options granted and assumed in our business combinations 
amortization of stock based compensation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization of stock based compensation in from was due to the assumption of stock options in the merger with imanage  while the decrease in from was primarily attributable to the use of the accelerated method of amortizing deferred stock based compensation expense  as prescribed by financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which has resulted in greater recognition of amortization expense in the beginning of the vesting period for such options 
amortization of stock based compensation related to the following expense categories in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for  and  respectively in thousands years ended december  cost of support and service revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative during  we recognized restructuring costs of million associated with accelerated vesting of stock awards for terminated employees 
this amount was included as a component of restructuring and excess facilities charges in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents in december  we issued options to our chief executive officer to purchase  shares of common stock  at an exercise price of per share  which was below the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
this deferred stock based compensation will be amortized to expense over the four year vesting period of the stock options using an accelerated approach consistent with the method described in fin no 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
r 
as we have million stock options outstanding at december   we expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
amortization of intangible assets years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages amortization of intangible assets percentage of total revenues amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and consists of amortization expense related to customer lists and assembled workforce 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets from to was primarily the result of our merger with imanage in november based on business combinations completed through december   we expect amortization of intangible assets to be million in  million in  million in and  in we may incur additional amortization expense beyond these expected future levels to the extent we make additional acquisitions 
in process research and development years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages in process research and development percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful in  in conjunction with our business combinations  we recorded in process research and development charges of  related to the acquisition of mediabin and million related to the merger with imanage 
these in process research and development charges were associated with software development efforts in process at the time of the business combinations that had not yet achieved technological feasibility and no future alternative uses had been identified 
the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was determined  in part  by a third party appraiser through established valuation techniques 
we may incur in process research and development expense in the future to the extent we make additional acquisitions 

table of contents restructuring and excess facilities charges years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages restructuring and excess facilities charges percentage of total revenues in  we implemented restructuring plans in an effort to better align our expenses with our revenues 
we recorded charges of million associated with workforce reductions and million associated with the abandonment of excess facilities and impairment of operating equipment and leasehold improvements at these facilities 
additionally  due to the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market  we revised our assumptions of future sublease income for facilities abandoned in and recorded an additional million in charges to reflect this change in estimate 
during  we implemented additional restructuring plans  performed an evaluation of our facilities requirements and re evaluated previously recorded excess facilities accruals 
as a result  we recorded charges of million associated with workforce reductions and million associated with the abandonment of excess facilities 
in addition  we further revised our estimates of future sublease income for facilities previously abandoned and recorded an additional million in charges as a result of changes in our estimates 
in  we entered into agreements to terminate excess facilities in chicago  illinois and sunnyvale  california  revised our sublease assumptions associated with certain excess facilities and restructured certain of our european operations and our professional services organization 
as a result of these actions  we recorded charges of million associated with excess facilities and million related to workforce reductions  which included the termination of employees 
the charges recorded for excess facilities were based on the payments due over the remainder of the lease term and estimated operating costs offset by our estimate of future sublease income 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities costs may differ from actual results and such differences may result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages impairment of goodwill percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we performed an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill and other identified intangible assets in the third quarter of upon the completion of this analysis  we determined that an impairment of goodwill had occurred as a result of a decrease in our market capitalization and due to a decline in our business performance 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in reflecting the write down of the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value 
we performed similar impairment tests during the third quarter of and and determined that the carrying value of our goodwill and other identified intangible assets had not been further impaired 

table of contents interest income and other  net years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages interest income and other  net percentage of total revenues interest income and other is composed of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and  to a lesser degree  interest expense 
interest income and other was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income and other decreased million  or in from and million  or  in from the decreases were due to lower interest rates on our cash and investments and a lower average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments during each successive period 
provision for income taxes years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes percentage of total revenues the provision for income taxes recorded in  and related principally to state and foreign taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income and will begin to expire in through and through management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and recognizes the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that these assets are realizable 
currently  it is determined that it is not likely that the assets will be realized 
therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred income tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our primary sources of cash are the collection of accounts receivable from our customers  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional services and facilities and related costs 
we have also used cash to purchase property and equipment  reduce our future payments due on excess facilities and acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings 
a number of non cash items were charged to expense and increased our net loss in  and  respectively 
these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets  impairment of goodwill  in process research and development and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
the extent to which these non cash items increase or decrease in amount and increase or decrease our future operating results will have no corresponding impact on our operating cash flows 
cash used in operating activities in was million  representing an improvement of million from this improvement primarily resulted from our net loss  after adjusting for non cash expenses  and 
table of contents payments to reduce our restructuring and excess facilities accrual offset by cash collections against accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenues 
payments made to reduce our excess facilities obligations totaled million and included scheduled lease payments on excess facilities and cash paid to terminate a portion of our headquarters lease and a lease in chicago  illinois 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days outstanding decreased from days at december  to days at december  days outstanding at december  were primarily impacted by the acquisition of accounts receivable from imanage and an increase in customer support billings resulting from our merger with imanage  which added to our outstanding accounts receivable 
deferred revenues increased primarily due to increased customer support contracts 
cash used in operating activities in was million  representing an increase of million from this increase primarily resulted from our net loss  after adjusting for non cash expenses  an increase in accounts receivable and payments against accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash used in operating activities was offset by an increase in deferred revenues and the accrual for restructuring and excess facilities 
our days outstanding increased to days at december  from days at december  the increase in days outstanding was due to the merger with imanage which occurred in november deferred revenues increased due to increased customer support contracts in large part resulting from the imanage merger 
the increase in the restructuring and excess facilities accrual resulted from the abandonment of properties associated with the imanage merger and the re evaluation of sublease prospects for our excess facilities 
cash used in operating activities in was million and primarily resulted from our net loss  after adjusting for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  the impairment of goodwill and payments against accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash used in operating activities was offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in the restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future  although we are not currently a party to any contracts or letters of intent with respect to any acquisitions 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
we may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions 
we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds is difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and general market conditions 
bank borrowings 
we have a million line of credit available to us at december   which is secured by cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the line of credit bears interest at the lower of below the bank s prime rate adjusted from time to time or a fixed rate of above the libor in effect on the first day of the term 
this line of credit agreement expires in july and is primarily used as collateral for letters of credit required by our facilities leases 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit as of december  there are no financial covenant requirements under our line of credit 

table of contents in connection with the imanage merger  we assumed a term loan with a bank secured by certain of our property and equipment 
the term loan was paid in full in december facilities 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through as of december   minimum cash payments due under our operating lease obligations totaled million 
the following presents our prospective future lease payments under these agreements as of december  excluding our estimate of potential sublease income in thousands future occupied excess lease years ending december  facilities facilities payments thereafter of these future minimum lease payments  we have accrued million in the restructuring and excess facilities accrual at december  this accrual includes estimated operating expenses of million associated with excess facilities and sublease commencement costs and is net of estimated sublease income of million and the impact of discounting of  in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require a significant amount of future lease payments to be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment would affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
we have entered into various standby letter of credit agreements associated with our facilities leases  which serve as required security deposits for such facilities 
these letters of credit expire at various times through at december   we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  which are secured by cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the following presents the outstanding commitments under these agreements at each respective balance sheet date for the next five years in thousands standby letters of years ending december  credit after we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with our existing line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding at any time 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and may have a material adverse impact on our 
table of contents consolidated financial results 
our primary exposures relate to non united states dollar denominated revenues and operating expenses in europe  asia pacific  australia and canada 
we use foreign currency forward contracts as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
gains and losses on the changes in the fair values of the forward contracts are included in interest income and other  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not anticipate significant currency gains or losses in the near term 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  loss from operations and net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating the accrual for restructuring and excess facilities costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the license of our software products and from support  consulting and training services that we provide to our customers 
we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  for agreements that have multiple deliverables or multiple element arrangements eg  software products  services  support  etc  revenue is recognized based on company specific objective evidence of fair value for all of the undelivered elements 
our specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price of the element when sold separately 
once we have established the fair value of each of the undelivered elements  the dollar value of the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements first and the residual of the dollar value of the arrangement is then allocated to the delivered elements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of undelivered elements eg  support  consulting and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and the arrangement does not require additional services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
at the outset of our customer arrangements  if we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
we assess whether 
table of contents the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with each transaction 
if a portion of the license fee is due beyond our normal payments terms  which generally does not exceed days from the invoice date  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we do not offer product return rights to end users 
we determine collectibility on a case by case basis  following analysis of the general payment history within the geographic sales region and a customer s years of operation  payment history and credit profile 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our review process  we recognize revenue as payments are received 
we periodically review collection patterns from our geographic locations to ensure historical collection results provide a reasonable basis for revenue recognition upon signing of an arrangement 
we determined that we had sufficient evidence in the first quarter of from customers in japan and singapore to begin recognizing revenue on an accrual basis and  in the third quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from customers in spain on an accrual basis 
previously  revenues had been recognized from customers in those countries only when cash was received and all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
support and service revenues consist of professional services and support fees 
professional services consist of software installation and integration  training and business process consulting 
professional services are predominantly billed on a time and materials basis and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
support contracts are typically priced as a percentage of the product license fee and generally have a one year term 
services provided to customers under support contracts include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades 
revenues from advanced payments for support contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provides an allowance for accounts receivable considered uncollectible 
management specifically analyzes its accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in general  our allowance for doubtful accounts consists of specific accounts where we believe collection is not probable and a rate based on our historical experience which is applied to accounts receivable not specifically reserved 
at december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  and million  respectively 
these amounts represent and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the continued improvement of our aged accounts receivable profile 
allowance for sales returns 
from time to time  a customer may return some or all of the software purchased 
while our software and reseller agreements do not provide for a specific right of return  we may accept product returns in certain circumstances 
to date  sales returns have been infrequent and not significant in relation to our total revenues 
we make an estimate of our expected returns and provide an allowance for sales returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
in determining the amount of the allowance required  management analyzes our revenue transactions  customer software installation patterns  historical return patterns  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
at december  and  our allowance for sales returns was  and  respectively 
restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
in order to better align our cost structure with our revenues  we implemented a series of restructuring and facility consolidation plans 
restructuring and facilities consolidation costs consist of expenses associated with workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities and the impairment of leasehold improvements and other equipment associated with abandoned facilities 
we accrue for severance payments and other related termination benefits provided to employees in connection with involuntary staff reductions 
we accrue for these benefits in the period when benefits are communicated to the terminated employees 
typically  terminated employees are not required to provide continued service to receive termination benefits 
if continued service is required  then the severance liability 
table of contents is accrued over the required service period 
in general  we use a formula based on a combination of the number of years of service and the employee s position within the company to calculate the termination benefits to be provided to affected employees 
at december    was accrued for future severance and termination benefits payments 
in connection with our restructuring and facility consolidation plans  we perform evaluations of our then current facilities requirements and identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when a facility is identified as excess and we have ceased use of the facility  we accrue the fair value of the lease obligations 
in determining fair value of expected sublease income over the remainder of the lease term and of related exit costs  if any  we receive appraisals from real estate brokers to aid in our estimate 
in addition  during the evaluation of our facilities requirements  we also identify operating equipment and leasehold improvements that may be impaired 
excluding the facilities that are currently subleased  our excess facilities are being marketed for sublease and are currently unoccupied 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities could differ from actual results and such differences could require additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had million accrued for excess facilities  which is payable through this accrual is net of estimated future sublease income of million 
we reassess our excess facilities liability each period based on current real estate market conditions 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  consisting principally of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
we performed and completed our required annual impairment testing in the third quarter of upon completing our review  we determined that the carrying value of our recorded goodwill of million had not been impaired and no impairment charge was 
table of contents recorded 
although we determined in that our recorded goodwill had not been impaired  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance may result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we are also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill may be impaired based on the factors mentioned above 
for example  if our market capitalization declines below our net book value or we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price  we will assess whether our goodwill has been impaired 
a significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and operating results 
we account for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during  and  we do not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the following table reflects the expected future amortization of intangible assets in thousands amortization amortization of intangible of purchased years ending december  assets technology total intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over estimated useful lives of between and months 
the amortization expense related to the intangible assets may be accelerated in the future if we reduce the estimated useful life of the intangible assets

factors that may impact our business the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
these risks include those that we consider to be significant to your decision whether to invest in our common stock at this time 
there may be risks that you view differently than we do  and there are other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know of or that we currently deem immaterial  but that may  in fact  harm our business in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 
you should consider carefully the following factors  in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  in evaluating our business 

table of contents we have incurred annual losses throughout our operating history and may not be able to achieve consistent profitability 
we have incurred operating losses on an annual basis throughout our history 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we did not incur a loss in the fourth quarter of  we may not be able to sustain operating profitability in the future 
we must increase our license and support and service revenues to sustain profitable operations and positive cash flows 
if our revenues do not grow  we will not maintain profitable operations  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  our revenues may decline from earlier periods resulting in greater operating losses and significant negative cash flows  which could cause us to fail and the price of our common stock to decline 
many factors can cause our revenues to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors or securities analysts  our stock price may decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect unpredictable fluctuations in the future 
the main factors impacting these fluctuations are likely to be the discretionary nature of our customers purchases and their budget cycles  the inherent complexity  length and associated unpredictability of our sales cycle  the number of new information technology initiatives launched by our customers  the success or failure of any of our product offerings to meet with customer acceptance  the size and complexity of our license and service transactions  delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  timing of new product releases  changes in competitors product offerings  sales force capacity and the influence of resellers and systems integrator partners  our ability to integrate newly acquired products with our existing products and effectively sell newly acquired products  the level of our sales incentive and commission related expenses  and seasonal variations in our operating results 
if any of the above factors occur or if the enterprise content management market does not grow as projected by industry analysts or we do not capture our competitive share of this market  then our results of operation will suffer 
further  if our results of operations do not meet our public forecasts or the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues are derived from a small number of software products and vertical markets 
for the years ended december   and  we believe that a significant portion of our total revenue was derived from the teamsite content server and related products and services 
we expect that our teamsite product will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
accordingly  any decline in the demand for our teamsite product will have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we also derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few vertical markets 
in particular  our worksite product is primarily sold to professional service organizations  such as legal and accounting firms  and corporate legal departments 
in order for us to sustain and grow our business  we must continue to successfully sell our software products and services into this vertical market 
failure to successfully sell to professional service organizations will have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated financial 
table of contents condition and results of operations 
in general  we believe that our customers in these markets are affected by the same conditions that affect our customers in other markets 
further  the future success of our collaborative content management software applications depends on our ability to sell software licenses and services to large multi national corporations in financial services  manufacturing  telecommunications and governmental entities 
to sell to these organizations  we must devote time and resources to hire and train sales employees to work with enterprises in industries other than legal and professional services 
even if we are successful in hiring and training sales teams  customers in other industries may not need or sufficiently value our collaborative content management software applications 
our products have a long and unpredictable sales cycle  which makes it difficult to forecast our future results and may cause our operating results to vary from period to period 
the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the licensing of our software applications varies and can range from less than three months to more than twelve months 
additionally  our sales cycle involves complexity as customers consider a number of factors before committing to purchase our application suite 
factors considered by customers when evaluating our software applications include  among other factors  product benefits  cost and time of implementation  return on investment  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems and the ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
customer evaluation  purchasing and budgeting processes vary significantly from company to company 
as a result  we spend significant time and resources informing prospective customers about our software products  which may not result in a completed transaction and may negatively impact our operating margins 
even if a customer chooses our software products  completion of the associated sales transaction is subject to a number of factors  which makes our quarterly revenues difficult to forecast 
these factors include but are not limited to the following licensing of our software products is often an enterprise wide decision by our customers that involves many factors 
accordingly  our ability to license our product may be affected by changes in the strategic importance of content management projects to a customer  a customer s budgetary constraints or changes in a customer s personnel 
passage through customer approval and expenditure authorization processes can be difficult and time consuming 
delays in the authorization approval process  even after vendor selection  could impact the timing and amount of revenues recognized in a quarterly period 
changes in our sales incentive plans may have an unpredictable impact on our sales cycle and contracting activities 
the number  timing and significance of enhancements to our software products and the introduction of new software by our competitors and us may affect customer purchases 
throughout and  our sales cycles continued to be affected by increased organizational review by prospective customers regardless of transaction size 
specifically  we experienced several delayed software license orders at the end of the second quarter of at levels greater than those experienced in any other quarter in a continued lengthening in sales cycles and our inability to predict these trends could result in lower than expected future revenue  which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated operating results and  correspondingly  our stock price 
our sales incentive plans are primarily based on quarterly and annual quotas by sales representatives and certain sales support personnel 
these sales incentive plans have accelerated commission rates in the event a representative exceeds the expected sales quota 
the concentration of sales orders with any one or a few sales representatives has resulted  and in the future may result  in commission expense in excess of forecasted levels  which have caused  or would in the future cause  fluctuations in sales and marketing expenses 
any increase in sales and marketing expenses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the market prices of the securities of software companies  including our own  have been extremely volatile and often unrelated to their operating performance 
broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of our stock may include  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates by us or in financial estimates or recommendations by any securities analysts who cover our stock  operating performance and stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and  in particular  those that are internet related or otherwise deemed comparable to us  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services  technological innovations  significant acquisitions  strategic relationships or divestitures  announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us  announcements of negative conclusions about our internal controls  capital outlays or commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sector factors including conditions or trends in our industry and the technology arena  and overall stock market factors  such as the price of oil futures  interest rates and the performance of the economy 
these fluctuations may make it more difficult to use our stock as currency to make acquisitions that might otherwise be advantageous  or to use stock options as a means to attract and retain employees 
any shortfall in revenue or net income loss compared to our or analysts or investors expectations could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  we may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
if we become subject to any litigation of this type  we could incur substantial costs and our management s attention and resources could be diverted while the litigation is ongoing 
competition from providers of software enabling content and collaboration management is increasing  which could cause us to reduce our prices and result in reduced gross margins or loss of market share 
the enterprise content management market is fragmented  rapidly changing and increasingly competitive 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition from current and potential competitors 
many of these competitors have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we have 
our current competitors include companies addressing needs of the market in which we compete such as emc corporation  filenet corporation  hummingbird ltd  ibm  microsoft corporation  xerox corporation  open text corporation  stellent  inc  oracle corporation and vignette corporation  intranet and groupware companies  such as ibm  microsoft corporation and novell  inc  in house development efforts by our customers and partners  and open source vendors such as redhat  inc  opencms and mambo 

table of contents we also face potential competition from our strategic partners  or from other companies that may in the future decide to compete in our market 
some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
many of these companies can also take advantage of extensive customer bases and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
potential competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
barriers to entering the content management software market are relatively low 
competitive pressures may also increase with the consolidation of competitors within our market and partners in our distribution channel  such as the acquisition of documentum  inc by emc corporation  presence online pty ltd 
by ibm  optika  inc by stellent  inc  artesia technologies  inc 
by open text corporation and tower technology pty ltd 
and epicentric  inc by vignette corporation 
in recent quarters  some of our competitors have reduced their price proposals in an effort to strengthen their bids and expand their customer bases 
such tactics  even if unsuccessful  could delay decisions by some customers that would otherwise purchase our software products and may reduce the ultimate selling price of our software and services  causing our operating results to be adversely affected 
our future revenues are dependent in part on our installed customer base continuing to license additional products  renew customer support agreements and purchase additional services 
our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional license and support and service revenues 
in addition  the success of our strategic plan depends on our ability to cross sell products  such as the products acquired in the acquisitions of mediabin  imanage and software intelligence to our installed base of customers 
in future periods  customers may not necessarily license additional products or contract for additional support or other services 
customer support agreements are generally renewable annually at a customer s option  and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
if our customers decide to cancel their support agreements or fail to license additional products or contract for additional services  or if they reduce the scope of their support agreements  revenues could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected 
the timing of large customer orders may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results from period to period 
from time to time  we receive large customer orders that have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue 
for example  we had three customer license transactions greater than million in because it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of large customer orders  our consolidated financial results are likely to vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 
additionally  the loss or delay of an anticipated large order in a given quarterly period could result in a shortfall of revenues from levels anticipated by us and our stockholders 
any shortfall in revenues from levels anticipated by our stockholders and securities analysts could have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 
economic conditions and significant world events have harmed and could continue to negatively affect our revenues and results of operations 
our revenue growth and profitability depend on the overall demand for our enterprise content management software platforms and applications 
the sharp decline in customer spending on information technology initiatives worldwide  particularly spending on public facing web applications  has resulted in and continues to result in lower revenues  longer sales cycles  lower average selling prices and deferred or cancelled orders 
to the extent that information technology spending does not improve or declines  the demand for our products and services  and therefore our future revenues  will be further affected 
in addition  many of our customers have also been affected adversely by these economic conditions and  as a result  we may find that collecting on accounts receivable may take longer than we expect or that some accounts receivable will become uncollectible 

table of contents our consolidated financial results could also be significantly affected by geopolitical concerns and world events  such as wars and terrorist attacks 
for example  we experienced delays in customer orders in the first quarter of as a result of concerns over the war in iraq 
our revenues and financial results could be negatively affected to the extent geopolitical concerns continue and similar events occur or are anticipated to occur 
support and service revenues have represented a large percentage of our total revenues in and our support and service revenues are vulnerable to reduced demand and increased competition 
our support and service revenues represented  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
support and service revenues depend  in part  on our ability to license software products to new and existing customers that generate follow on consulting  training and support revenues 
demand for these services is also affected by competition from independent service providers and systems integrators with knowledge of our software products 
since mid  we have experienced increased competition for service engagements  which has resulted in an overall decrease in average billing rates for our consultants and price pressure on our software support products 
if these factors continue to affect our business  our support and service revenues may decline and such a decline would have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
increases in support and service revenues as a percentage of total revenues may decrease overall margins 
we realize lower margins on support and service revenues than on license revenues 
in addition  we may contract with outside consultants and system integrators to supplement the services we provide to customers  which generally yields lower gross margins than the gross margins yielded by our captive services business 
as a result  if support and service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues or if we increase our use of third parties to provide such services  our gross margins will be lower and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our failure to deliver defect free software could result in losses and harmful publicity 
our software products are complex and have in the past and may in the future contain defects or failures that may be detected at any point in the product s life 
we have discovered software defects in the past in some of our products after their release 
although past defects have not had a material effect on our results of operations  in the future we may experience delays or lost revenues caused by new defects 
despite our testing  defects and errors may still be found in new or existing products  and may result in delayed or lost revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  reduced customer satisfaction  diversion of development resources and damage to our reputation 
as has occurred in the past  new releases of products or product enhancements may require us to provide additional services under our support contracts to ensure proper installation and implementation 
errors in our application suite may be caused by defects in third party software incorporated into our applications 
if so  we may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers 
since these defects may not be as significant to our software providers as they are to us  we may not receive the rapid cooperation that we may require 
we may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third party software and  even if we access the source code  we may not be able to fix the defect 
as customers rely on our products for critical business applications  errors  defects or other performance problems of our products or services might result in damage to the businesses of our customers 
consequently  these customers could delay or withhold payment to us for our software and services  which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable  both of which could disappoint investors and result in a significant decline in our stock price 
in addition  these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time consuming and costly and harm our reputation  and thus our ability to license products to new customers 
even if a suit is not brought  correcting errors in our application suite could increase our expenses 

table of contents we might not be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  a loss of which could harm our business 
we depend upon our proprietary technology and rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to protect it 
we currently have issued united states patents and foreign patents  as well as several united states and foreign patents pending approval 
these patents may not offer us meaningful product differentiation or market exclusivity because there are alternative processes available or prospective customers do not assign material value to the unique capabilities inherent in the patented processes 
it is possible that patents will not be issued from our currently pending applications or any future patent application we may file 
we also have restricted customer access to our source code and require all employees enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as the laws of the united states and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international presence 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
further  third parties may claim that our products infringe the intellectual property of their products 
in fact  on august   advanced software  inc filed suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that our teamsite software infringes advanced software s united states patent no 
re 
 we believe the claim is without merit and intend to vigorously contest this matter 
however  this claim or any other claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention or cause product delays 
if our product was found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our product 
royalty and licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which could harm our business 
because a significant portion of our revenues are influenced by referrals from strategic partners and sold through resellers  our future success depends in part on those partners  but their interests differ from ours 
our direct sales force depends on strategic partnerships  marketing alliances and resellers to obtain customer leads  referrals and distribution 
about two thirds of our new license orders in were influenced by our strategic partners and resellers 
if we are unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or fail to enter into additional strategic relationships  our ability to increase revenues will be harmed  and we could also lose anticipated customer introductions and co marketing benefits 
our success depends in part on the success of our strategic partners and their ability and willingness to market our products and services successfully 
losing the support of these third parties may limit our ability to compete in existing and potential markets 
these third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support our software products and could recommend or give higher priority to the products and services of other companies  including those of one or more of our competitors  or to their own products 
our inability to gain the support of resellers  consulting and systems integrator firms or a shift by these companies toward favoring competing products could negatively affect our software license and support and service revenues 
some systems integrators also engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if our relationship with these parties fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our software products 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
a number of our competitors have longer and more established relationships with these systems integrators than we do and  as a result  these systems integrators may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services 

table of contents we may also be unable to grow our revenues if we do not successfully obtain leads and referrals from our customers 
if we are unable to maintain these existing customer relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  we will be required to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our products 
as a result  we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to provide us with introductions  referrals and leads 
our current customer relationships do not afford us any exclusive marketing and distribution rights 
in addition  our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time  pursue relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products that compete with our products 
even if our customers act as references and provide us with leads and introductions  we may not penetrate additional markets or grow our revenues 
we also rely on our strategic relationships to aid in the development of our products 
should our strategic partners not regard us as significant to their own businesses  they could reduce their commitment to us or terminate their relationship with us  pursue competing relationships or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products and services 
contractual issues may arise during the negotiation process that may delay the anticipated closure of license transactions and our ability to recognize revenue as anticipated 
because our solution is mission critical to many of our customers  the process of contractual negotiation may be protracted 
the additional time needed to negotiate mutually acceptable terms that culminate in an agreement to license our products could extend the sales cycle 
several factors may also require us to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including instances in which we are required to deliver either specified additional products or product upgrades for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
we have a standard software license agreement that provides for revenue recognition provided that  among other factors  delivery has taken place  collectibility from the customer is probable and no significant future obligations or customer acceptance rights exist 
however  customer negotiations and revisions to these terms could have an impact on our ability to recognize revenue at the time of delivery 
in addition  slowdowns or variances from internal expectations in our quarterly license contracting activities may impact our service offerings and may result in lower revenues from our customer training  consulting services and customer support organizations 
our ability to maintain or increase support and service revenues is highly dependent on our ability to increase the number of license agreements we enter into with customers 
our revenues from international operations are a significant part of our overall operating results 
we have established offices in various international locations in europe and asia pacific  including a customer support and development operation in bangalore  india and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these international locations 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from these international operations constituted approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we anticipate devoting significant resources and management attention to international opportunities  which subjects us to a number of risks including difficulties in staffing  retaining staff and managing foreign operations  the expense of foreign operations and compliance with applicable laws  political and economic instability  the expense of localizing products for sale in various international markets  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  difficulties in the handling of transactions denominated in foreign currency and the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  
table of contents changes in multiple tax and regulatory requirements  longer sales cycles and collection periods or seasonal reductions in business activity  and economic conditions in international markets 
any of these risks could reduce revenues from international locations  or increase our cost of doing business outside of the united states 
our workforce reductions may require us to incur severance costs and reduce our facilities commitments  which may cause us to incur expenses or recognize additional financial statement charges 
over the last several years  we have significantly reduced our worldwide employee headcount 
in connection with our restructuring plans and business combinations  we relocated offices and abandoned facilities in the san francisco bay area  chicago  new york city  boston  austin  texas and several locations internationally 
as a result  we are paying for facilities that we are not using and have no future plans to use 
we recorded charges for excess facilities  net of expected sublease income  of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we have an accrual for excess facilities of million  which is net of anticipated sublease income of million 
if the commercial real estate market continues to deteriorate  if our anticipated sublease income is not realized or if we cannot sublease these excess facilities at all  we may be required to record additional charges for excess facilities or revise our estimate of sublease income in the future which may be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we have continued to review our operational performance across the company and will continue to make cost adjustments to better align our expenses with our expected revenues 
for example  in the quarter ended june   we implemented a restructuring plan in certain of our european locations to better align our expenses with future revenue potential 
these actions resulted in the termination of employees and a charge of million associated with these terminations 
we may be required to make further adjustments to our business model to achieve operational efficiency and  as a result  may be required to take additional charges which could be material to our results of operations 
if our products cannot scale to meet the demands of tens of thousands of concurrent users  our targeted customers may not license our solutions  which will cause our revenues to decline 
our strategy includes targeting large organizations that require our enterprise content management software because of the significant amounts of content that these companies generate and use 
for this strategy to succeed  our software products must be highly scalable and accommodate tens of thousands of concurrent users 
if our products cannot scale to accommodate a large number of concurrent users  our target markets will not accept our products and our business and operating results will suffer 
if our customers cannot successfully implement large scale software deployments  or if they determine that our products cannot accommodate large scale deployments  our customers will not license our solutions and this will materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and operating results 
if our products do not operate with a wide variety of hardware  software and operating systems used by our customers  our revenues would be harmed 
we currently serve a customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and operating systems 
for example  we have designed our products to work with databases and servers developed by microsoft corporation  sun microsystems  inc  oracle corporation and ibm and with software applications including microsoft office  wordperfect  lotus notes and novell groupwise 
we must continually modify and enhance our software products to keep pace with changes in computer hardware and software and database technology as well as emerging technical standards in the software industry 
we further believe that our application suite will gain broad market acceptance only if it can support a wide variety of hardware  software applications and systems 
if our products were unable to support a variety of these 
table of contents products  our business would be harmed 
additionally  customers could delay purchases of our application suite until they determine how our products will operate with these updated platforms or applications 
our products currently operate on the microsoft windows xp  microsoft windows nt  microsoft windows  linux  ibm aix  hewlett packard ux and sun solaris operating environments 
if other platforms become more widely used  we could be required to convert our server application products to additional platforms 
we may not succeed in these efforts  and even if we do  potential customers may not choose to license our product 
in addition  our products are required to interoperate with leading content authoring tools and application servers 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in these applications and operating systems 
if our products were to be incompatible with a popular new operating system or business application  our business could be harmed 
also  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by vendors of operating systems  browsers  back office applications and other technology related applications  could harm our business 
difficulties in introducing new products and upgrades in a timely manner will make market acceptance of our products less likely 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and technology related enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
we expect to add new content management functionality to our product offerings by internal development and possibly by acquisition 
content management technology is more complex than most software and new products or product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing new products could harm our business 
new products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule or may contain defects when released 
either situation could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new software products  or deliver enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
our products may lack essential functionality if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses to third party software and applications 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
the functionality of our software products  therefore  depends on our ability to integrate these third party technologies into our products 
furthermore  we may license additional software from third parties in the future to add functionality to our products 
if our efforts to integrate this third party software into our products are not successful  our customers may not license our products and our business will suffer 
in addition  we would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license software fail to continue to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products or respond to emerging industry standards 
moreover  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
each of these license agreements may be renewed only with the other party s written consent 
the loss of  or inability to maintain or obtain licensed software  could result in shipment delays or reductions 
furthermore  we may be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm our business and operating results 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency  particularly in euro  british pound and australian dollar and the various other local currencies of asia and europe  may harm our business 
we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes 
our primary exposures have related to operating expenses and sales in asia and europe that were not united states dollar denominated 
historically  these risks have been minimal for us  but as our international revenues and operations have grown and continue to 
table of contents grow  the adverse currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
new legislation and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
recently  there have been significant regulatory changes  including the sarbanes oxley act of  and there may be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings that will have an impact on our future consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and other rule changes following several highly publicized corporate accounting and corporate governance failures are likely to increase general and administrative costs 
these changes have and may continue to materially increase the expenses we report under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and adversely affect our consolidated operating results 
additionally  the impact of these changes may increase costs incurred by our customers and prospects which could result in delays or cancellations in spending on enterprise content management software and services like those we provide 
such delays and cancellations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations and financial condition 
when we account for employee stock options using the fair value method  it will significantly increase our compensation costs 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  and we will be required to adopt this statement in the third quarter of we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
r  but as we have million stock options outstanding at december   we expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting and asset impairments may adversely affect the market value of our common stock 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we accounted for the acquisitions of mediabin  imanage and certain assets and liabilities of software intelligence using the purchase method of accounting  which resulted in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock following these acquisitions 
under the purchase method of accounting  we allocated the total estimated purchase price of these acquisitions to their net tangible assets  amortizable intangible assets  intangible assets with indefinite lives based on their fair values as of the closing date of these transactions and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
a portion of the estimated purchase price in the imanage and mediabin acquisitions was also allocated to in process technology and was expensed in the quarter in which the acquisition was completed 
we will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain net tangible and intangible assets acquired and significant stock based compensation expense in connection with these transactions 
these depreciation and amortization charges could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
at december   we had million in goodwill and million in net other intangible assets  which we believe are recoverable 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america require that we review the value of these acquired assets from time to time to determine whether the recorded values have been impaired and should be reduced 
in connection with our review  we reduced recorded goodwill by million 
we performed our required annual impairment test for calendar in the third quarter and no additional reduction to recorded goodwill was required at that time 
we will continue to perform impairment assessments on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill or our intangible assets may be impaired 
these indicators include our market capitalization declining below our net book value or if we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price 
changes in the economy  the business in which we 
table of contents operate and our own relative performance may result in indicators that our recorded asset values may be impaired 
if we determine there has been an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of those assets will be written down to fair value  and a charge against operating results will be recorded in the period that the determination is made 
any impairment could have a material impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position  and could harm the trading price of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of december  and dollars in thousands years ended december  cash equivalents and short term investments average interest rate our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   we had net unrealized losses of  associated with these securities 
assuming an average investment balance of million  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in a  increase decrease in annual interest income 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risk we develop our software products in the united states for sale in the americas  europe and asia pacific 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets 
a majority of our revenues are denominated in united states dollars  however  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our software products less competitive in foreign markets 
we enter into forward foreign currency contracts to manage the exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we had outstanding forward foreign currency contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately million at december  the forward foreign currency contracts mature in february and offset certain foreign currency transaction exposures in the euro  british pound and australian dollar 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts at december  was approximately million 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  measuring the change in fair value arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates vis vis the united states dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers all of our foreign currency contracts offset by underlying exposures 
we used foreign currency exchange rates based on market rates in effect at december  this sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign 
table of contents currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments  net of exposures  of  at december  we regularly review our foreign currency strategy and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our strategy 
commodity price risk we did not hold commodity instruments as of december   and have never had such instruments in the past
