total net revenues in were higher than as a result of revenue increases in all of the company s segments related to increases in advertising demand 
in  the demand for advertising was favorably affected by the improving us economy and  in the television group  by the volume of advertising time purchased by campaigns for elective offices and for political issues

gaap and non gaap financial measures in this report  financial measures are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and also on a non gaap basis 
the company defines consolidated ebitda as net earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
consolidated ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap 
management uses consolidated ebitda in internal analyses as a supplemental measure of the financial performance of the company to assist it with determining consolidated performance targets and performance comparisons against its peer group of companies  as well as capital spending and other investing decisions 
consolidated ebitda is also a belo corp 

table of contents common alternative measure of performance used by investors  financial analysts  and rating agencies to evaluate financial performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates belo s financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical accounting policies currently affecting belo s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition broadcast revenue is recorded  net of agency commissions  when commercials are aired 
newspaper advertising revenue is recorded  net of agency commissions  when the advertisements are published in the newspaper 
advertising revenues for internet web sites are recorded  net of agency fees  ratably over the period of time the advertisement is placed on web sites 
proceeds from subscriptions are deferred and are included in revenue on a pro rata basis over the term of the subscriptions 
commercial printing revenue is recorded when the product is shipped 
bad debts belo maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of belo s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
at december   belo had investments of million in net property  plant and equipment  billion in goodwill and billion in intangible assets  primarily fcc licenses 
during the years ended december  and  the company did not record any impairment losses related to property  plant  and equipment  goodwill or intangible assets 
prior to january   all of the acquired intangible assets were classified together as goodwill and intangible assets in the company s consolidated financial statements and were amortized over a composite life of years 
effective january   the company reclassified the fcc licenses apart from goodwill as separate indefinite lived intangible assets and ceased amortization of both goodwill and the fcc licenses 
the company was not able to reclassify any amounts related to the network affiliation agreements apart from goodwill  as the accounting records that would allow for segregation of these assets were not available 
substantially all of the network affiliation agreements acquired in these business acquisitions were acquired prior to december   and many of these agreements have been modified or replaced by new agreements 
in addition  the company believes that network affiliation agreements currently do not have a material value that is separable from the related fcc licenses  because without an fcc license  a broadcast company cannot obtain a network affiliation agreement 
accordingly  the company believes that the remaining value of its acquired network affiliated agreements was not significant as of january  if the company had assigned separate values for its acquired network affiliation agreements and  therefore  less value to its broadcast licenses  it would have had a significant impact on the company s historical operating results 
the following chart reflects the impact of a hypothetical reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliation agreements and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a year amortization period 
however  had the company amortized the values over the lives of the respective contracts  there would have been no material impact on the company s results of operations for the year ended december   as substantially all of these agreements have been modified or replaced since acquisition

in the opinion of management  liabilities  if any  arising from these claims and litigation would not have a material adverse effect on belo s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
employee benefits belo is effectively self insured for employee related health care benefits 
a third party administrator is used to process all claims 
belo s employee health insurance liability is based on the company s historical claims experience and is developed from actuarial valuations 
belo s reserves associated with the exposure to the self insured liabilities are monitored by management for adequacy 
however  actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates 
pension benefits belo s pension costs and obligations are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the company uses assumptions including  but not limited to  the selection of the discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets  projected salary increases and mortality rates 
the discount rate assumption is based on a review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during the year 
the assumptions regarding the long term rate of return on plan assets and projected salary increases are based on an evaluation of the company s historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension reporting are reviewed periodically and compared with external benchmarks for reasonableness 
although the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences between assumed and actual experience may affect the company s operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s pension plan 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is third quarter for calendar year companies 
the company currently expects to adopt sfas r effective july  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
financial information for periods prior to the date of adoption of sfas r would not be restated 
the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits belo corp 

table of contents the use of a lattice model 
the company has not yet determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of awards of equity instruments to employees upon the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r will have significant effect on the company s future results of operations 
however  it will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
the impact of sfas r on the company s results of operations cannot be predicted at this time  because it will depend on the number of equity awards granted in the future  as well as the model used to value the awards 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
however  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions for the years ended december    and was not material 
results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts compared with consolidated results of operations total net operating revenue increased  or percent  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   due to revenue increases of  in the television group   in the newspaper group   in interactive media and  in other
