item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leader in the development  manufacture and sale of proprietary  disposable medical connection systems for use in intravenous iv therapy applications 
our devices are designed to protect healthcare workers and their patients from exposure to infectious diseases such as hepatitis b and c and human immunodeficiency virus hiv through accidental needlesticks 
we are also a leader in the production of custom iv systems and low cost generic iv systems and we incorporate our proprietary products on many of those custom iv systems 
results for the year the company reported net income of million in  a decrease of million from the decline in net income in is principally because hospira  inc decreased the level of purchases because it is making a substantial reduction in its inventories of our products 
our sales to hospira declined million from  and million of that decline was in clave products 
because of the reduced sales to hospira  we curtailed our production of clave products  but  since much of our manufacturing costs are fixed  the reduced production resulted in unabsorbed overhead of approximately million 
information provided by hospira indicates that hospira s unit sales of clave products to its customers have continued to increase throughout we believe that once hospira reduces its inventory to the desired level  which they informed us had been accomplished by the end of december  our sales of clave products to hospira will increase from levels in and will more closely match its sales to its customers than they have in the past 
because our inventory of clave products was higher than normal at december   we expect reduced production levels and unabsorbed overhead to continue into early sales of our punctur guard products declined from million in to million in we have experienced lower unit volumes and have reduced prices to achieve wider distribution 
in september  we invested approximately million in a company developing a new medical device 
approximately million of the company s investment was allocated to in process research and development  and that amount  which is non recurring  was charged to research and development expense in the company s consolidated financial statements in september our operating expenses including research and development increased approximately million in as compared to this was principally because of the million expense of in process research and development mentioned above  costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  non recurring patent amortization and increased information technology costs 
the following table is a reconciliation of income from operations from the year ended to income from operations from the year ended in millions of dollars income from operations sales reduction from to  approximate effect on gross profit unabsorbed overhead in excess of in increased operating expenses  including in process r d income from operations risk factors in evaluating a transaction in our common stock  investors should consider carefully  among other things  the following risk factors  as well as the other information contained in this annual report and our other reports and registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
because we are increasingly dependent on hospira for a substantial portion of our sales  any change in our arrangements with hospira or decline in our sales to it could result in a significant reduction in our sales and profits 
we have steadily increased our sales to hospira in recent years  except for when sales to hospira declined as hospira reduced its inventories of our products 
as a result  we depend on one customer  hospira  for a high percentage of our sales  and the percentage of our sales attributable to hospira will increase as we begin manufacturing additional products for hospira as described below 
although we have increased our sales to independent domestic distributors during recent years  most of the increase resulted from our dealers acquisition of market shares from a manufacturer with whom we terminated our clave distribution agreement and the addition of the punctur guard line in late the percentage increase in distributor sales in is attributable to the decline in sales to hospira 
the table below shows our sales to various types of customers for  and years ended december  hospira other manufacturers independent distributors international in  hospira substantially reduced its purchases of clave products because it was reducing its inventories of our products 
this caused a significant reduction in our sales and led to a net loss in our third and fourth quarters of we have taken steps to monitor and control the amount of inventory of hospira clave products manufactured in order to mitigate the need for future inventory reductions similar to that in  but there is no assurance that these steps will be successful  or that hospira will not attempt to reduce its inventory of clave products even further in the future 
hospira had disclosed that clave products accounted for approximately of its consolidated sales 
in the past several years  our prices to hospira have declined by only a small amount 
any significant decrease in our prices to hospira  unless accompanied by an offsetting increase in purchasing volume  could have an adverse effect on our sales and profits 
our sales to hospira will increase substantially as a result of a twenty year manufacturing  commercialization and development agreement mcda that we entered into with hospira on february  under the mcda and related agreements  we will acquire hospira s salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility  related capital equipment and certain inventories that do not include icu medical products for approximately million in cash  and produce for sale to hospira on an exclusive basis substantially all the products manufactured at that plant 
hospira will retain commercial responsibility for the products we will be producing  including sales  marketing  distribution  customer contracts  customer service and billing 
the majority of the products we will be producing under the mcda are hospira s critical care products  which include medical devices such as catheters  angiography kits and cardiac monitoring systems 
we have also committed to fund certain research and development to improve critical care products and develop new products for sale to hospira  and have committed to provide certain sales specialist support 
our prices and our gross margins on the products we sell to hospira under the mcda will be based on cost savings that we are able to achieve in producing those products over hospira s current cost to manufacture those same products 
we expect to move the production to our current facilities or other lower cost locations over the next several years 
we estimate that sales under this agreement will exceed million in  with only small profits  with increasing sales and profits in future years 
however  this sales estimate is subject to a variety of factors and there can be no assurance that the prospective results will be indicative of future performance or that actual results will not vary materially from this estimate 
under the terms of our agreements with hospira  including the mcda  we are dependent on the marketing and sales efforts of hospira for a large percentage of our sales  and hospira determines the prices at which the products that we sell to hospira will be sold to its customers 
hospira has conditional exclusive rights to sell clave and our other products as well as custom iv systems under the setsource program in many of its major accounts 
hospira s rights to sell products we produce under the mcda are exclusive 
if hospira is unable to maintain its position in the marketplace  or if hospira should experience significant price deterioration  our sales and operations could be adversely affected 
in contrast to our dependence on hospira  our principal competitors in the market for protective iv connection systems are much larger companies that dominate the market for iv products and have broad product lines and large internal distribution networks 
in many cases  these competitors are able to establish exclusive relationships with large hospitals  hospital chains  major buying organizations and home healthcare providers to supply substantially all of their requirements for iv products 
in addition  we believe that there is a trend among individual hospitals and home healthcare providers to consolidate into or join large major buying organizations with a view to standardizing and obtaining price advantages on disposable medical products 
these factors may limit our ability to gain market share through our independent dealer network  resulting in continued concentration of sales among and dependence on hospira 
hospira  a major supplier of iv products  was formerly the hospital products division of abbott laboratories 
on april   abbott spun off hospira to its stockholders as an independent company 
since then  hospira has been a separate entity  independent of abbott 
the principal hospira agreement  for products other than the mcda  is a strategic supply and distribution arrangements to market our products in connection with hospira s iv products 
the agreement extends through our ability to maintain and increase our market penetration may depend on the success of our arrangements with hospira and hospira s arrangements with major buying organizations and its ability to renew such arrangements  as to which there is no assurance 
if our strategic supply and distribution arrangement proves unsuccessful  our sales would be materially adversely affected 
our business could be materially adversely affected if hospira terminates its arrangement with us  negotiates lower prices  sells more competing products  whether manufactured by themselves or others  or otherwise alters the nature of its relationship with us 
although we believe that hospira views us as a source of innovative and profitable products  there is no assurance that our relationship with hospira will continue in its current form 
if we are unable to manage effectively our internal growth or growth through acquisitions of companies  assets or products  our financial performance may be adversely affected 
we intend to continue to expand our marketing and distribution capability internally  by expanding our sales and marketing staff and resources and may expand it externally  by acquisitions both in the united states and foreign markets 
we may also consider expanding our product offerings through further acquisitions of companies or product lines 
we intend to build additional production facilities or contract for manufacturing in markets outside the united states to reduce labor costs and eliminate transportation and other costs of shipping finished products from the united states and mexico to customers outside north america 
the expansion of our manufacturing  marketing  distribution and product offerings both internally and through acquisitions or by contract may place substantial burdens on our management resources and financial controls 
decentralization of assembly and manufacturing could place further burdens on management to manage those operations  and maintain efficiencies and quality control 
the performance of the mcda under which we will produce critical care products for hospira  the acquisition of related manufacturing assets  the addition of more than production personnel  the relocation of manufacturing operations  the implementation of new manufacturing and assembly processes and techniques and the establishment of financial controls will impose a significant burden on our management  human resources  operating and financial and accounting functions 
we will need to expand our capabilities in each of these areas and devote significant time and effort to integrating the production under the mcda with our existing operations  all of which will divert management s attention from our current operations 
in addition we may require additional expertise  capability and capacity that can best be obtained through other acquisitions 
the increasing burdens on our management resources and financial controls resulting from internal growth of acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks in addition to the difficulty of integrating cultures and operations and the diversion of management s attention  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets  some or all of which could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 
if we are unable to reduce substantially the cost of manufacturing products that we will sell to hospira under the mcda  we may not be able to produce and sell such products profitably  and our profit margins may decline 
the prices at which we will sell products to hospira and the gross margins that we will realize under the mcda will depend on the cost savings that we are able to achieve in producing those products over hospira s cost to manufacture the same products 
achieving substantial cost reductions will require moving manufacturing operations to lower cost locations and the development and implementation of innovative manufacturing and assembly processes and techniques 
there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
if we are unable to achieve the cost savings that we expect  we may not be able to sell products manufactured under the mcda profitably  and our profit margins may decline 
because we are dependent on the clave for the majority of our sales  any decline in clave sales could result in a significant reduction in our sales and profits 
during  clave products accounted for approximately of our net sales and of our net sales including customer iv systems 
we depend heavily on sales of clave products  especially sales of clave products to hospira 
we cannot give any assurance that sales of clave products will continue to increase indefinitely to hospira or other customers or that we can sustain current profit margins on clave products indefinitely 
management believes that the success of the clave has motivated  and will continue to motivate  others to develop one piece needleless connectors 
in addition to products that emulate the characteristics of the clave  it is possible that others could develop new product concepts and technologies that are functionally equivalent or superior to the clave 
if other manufacturers successfully develop and market effective products that are competitive with clave products  clave sales could decline as we lose market share  and or we could encounter sustained price and profit margin erosion 
if our efforts to increase substantially our custom iv system business is not successful or we cannot increase sales of other products and develop new  commercially successful products  our sales may not continue to grow 
our continued success may be dependent both on the success of our strategic initiative to increase substantially our custom iv set business and develop significant market share on a profitable basis and on new product development 
our sales of custom iv systems reached million in  but this was only a increase over sales  whereas sales increased over the success of our custom iv system sales program will require a larger increase in annual sales in the future than was achieved in the ability of the custom iv system and low cost iv system products to acquire significant market share on a profitable basis depends on whether we are able to continue to develop systems capabilities  improve manufacturing efficiencies  lower inventory carrying costs  reduce labor costs and expand distribution 
the accomplishment of each of these objectives will require significant innovation  and we might not succeed in these endeavors 
although we are seeking to continue to develop a variety of new products  there is no assurance that any new products will be commercially successful or that we will be able to recover the costs of developing  testing  producing and marketing such products 
certain healthcare product manufacturers  with financial and distribution resources substantially greater than ours  have developed and are marketing products intended to fulfill the functions of our products 
continuing reductions in the prices of our iv connector products could have an adverse effect on profit margins and profits 
the hospira agreement establishes the prices that hospira will pay for our products  which are lower than our average selling prices in our other sales channels 
in response to competitive pressure  we had steadily reduced selling prices of the clave to protect and expand its market although overall pricing has been stable recently 
reductions in selling prices could adversely affect gross margins and profits if we cannot achieve corresponding reductions in unit manufacturing costs or increased volume 
international sales pose additional risks related to competition with larger international companies and established local companies  our possibly higher cost structure  our ability to open foreign manufacturing facilities that can operate profitably  higher credit risks and exchange rate risk 
we have undertaken a program to increase significantly our international sales  and have distribution arrangements in all the principal countries in western europe  the pacific rim and latin america  and in south africa 
we plan to sell in most other areas of the world 
currently  we export from the united states and mexico most of the product sold internationally 
our principal competitors are a number of much larger companies as well as smaller companies already established in the countries into which we sell our products 
our cost structure is often higher than that of our competitors because of the relatively high cost of transporting product to the local market as well as low cost local labor in some markets 
for these reasons  among others  we expect to open manufacturing facilities in foreign locations 
there is no certainty that we will be able to open local manufacturing facilities or that those facilities will operate on a profitable basis 
our international sales are subject to higher credit risks than sales in the united states 
many of our distributors are small and may not be well capitalized 
payment terms are relatively long 
our prices to our international distributors are set in us dollars  but their resale prices are set in their local currency 
a decline in the value of the local currency in relation to the us dollar may adversely affect their ability to profitably sell in their market the products they buy from us  and may adversely affect their ability to make payment to us for the product they purchase 
legal recourse for non payment of indebtedness may be uncertain 
these factors all contribute to a potential for credit losses 
in  we acquired a small manufacturer of iv systems in northern italy  and have since transferred our european distribution to this subsidiary 
this subsidiary is not yet operating profitably and there is no assurance that it will achieve profitability in the future 
continuing pressures to reduce healthcare costs may adversely affect our prices 
if we cannot reduce manufacturing costs of existing and new products  our sales may not continue to grow and our profitability may decline 
increasing awareness of healthcare costs  public interest in healthcare reform and continuing pressure from medicare  medicaid and other payers to reduce costs in the healthcare industry  as well as increasing competition from other protective products  could make it more difficult for us to sell our products at current prices 
in the event that the market will not accept current prices for our products  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
we believe that our ability to increase our market share and operate profitably in the long term may depend in part on our ability to reduce manufacturing costs on a per unit basis through high volume production using highly automated molding and assembly systems 
if we are unable to reduce unit manufacturing costs  we may be unable to increase our market share for clave products or lose market share to alternative products  including competitors products 
similarly  if we cannot reduce unit manufacturing costs of new products as production volumes increase  we may not be able to sell new products profitably or gain any meaningful market share 
any of these results would adversely affect our future results of operations 
increases in costs of electricity or interruptions in electrical service could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we use a significant amount of electricity in our molding and automated assembly operations in san clemente  california 
rates are approximately double what they were five years ago  and there is no certainty that they will not increase further in the future 
in addition  public concerns are again being raised about possible interruptions in service because of a lack of availability of electricity 
any significant increase in electrical costs or a significant interruption in service could have an adverse effect on our operations 
increases in the cost of oil based products could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
most of the material used in our products is resins  plastics and other material that depend upon oil as their raw material 
oil prices in early are at or near record highs 
our suppliers have passed some of these increases on to us  and if oil prices are sustained or increase further  our suppliers may pass further price increases on to us 
our ability to recover those higher costs may depend upon our ability to raise prices to our customers 
in the past  we have rarely ever raised prices and it is uncertain that we would be able to raise them to recover higher prices from our suppliers 
our inability to raise prices in those circumstances could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
our products could become obsolete if other companies are successful in developing technologies and products that are superior to ours 
many companies are developing products and technologies to address the need for safe and cost effective iv connection systems 
it is possible that others may develop superior iv connection system technologies or alternative approaches that prove superior to our products 
our products could become obsolete as a result of such developments  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to compete successfully on the basis of product innovation  quality  convenience  price and rapid delivery with larger companies that have substantially greater resources and larger distribution networks  we may be unable to maintain market share  in which case our sales may not grow and our profitability may be adversely affected 
the market for iv products is intensely competitive 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon continued product innovation  the quality  convenience and reliability of our products  access to distribution channels  patent protection and price 
the ability of our custom iv and low cost system products to compete will depend on our ability to distinguish our products from the competition based on product pricing  quality and rapid delivery 
we encounter significant competition in our markets both from large established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies 
many of these firms have introduced competitive products with protective features not provided by the conventional products and methods they are intended to replace 
most of our current and prospective competitors have economic and other resources substantially greater than ours and are well established as suppliers to the healthcare industry 
several large  established competitors offer broad product lines and have been successful in obtaining full line contracts with a significant number of hospitals to supply all of their iv product requirements 
there is no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase resources devoted to the development  manufacture and marketing of products competitive with our products 
the successful implementation of such a strategy by one or more of our competitors could materially and adversely affect us 
if we were to experience problems with our highly complex manufacturing and automated assembly processes  as we have at times in the past  or if we cannot obtain additional custom tooling and equipment on a timely enough basis to meet demand for our products  we might be unable to increase our sales or might lose customers  in which case our sales could decline 
we manufacture substantially all of our product components  except for standard components which are available as commodity items  and assemble them into finished products 
automated assembly of components into finished products involves complex procedures requiring highly sophisticated assembly equipment which is custom designed  engineered and manufactured for us 
as a result of the critical performance criteria for our products  we have at times experienced problems with the design criteria for or the molding or assembly of our products 
while we believe that we have resolved all design  manufacturing and assembly problems with respect to current products  there is no assurance that operations will not be adversely affected by unanticipated problems with current products or if such problems are experienced with future products 
we have expanded our manufacturing capacity substantially in recent years  and we expect continuing expansion will be necessary 
molds and automated assembly machines generally have a long lead time with vendors  often six months or longer 
inability to secure such tooling in a timely manner  or unexpected increases in production demands  could cause us to be unable to meet customer orders 
such inability could cause customers to seek alternatives to our products 
we may not be able to significantly expand our sales of custom and low cost  generic iv systems if we are unable to lower manufacturing costs  price our products below our competitors prices and shorten delivery times significantly 
our custom iv system products do not have any inherent competitive advantage over other competitors products 
we believe that the success of our iv systems operations will depend on our ability to lower per unit manufacturing costs and price our products below our competitors prices and on our ability to shorten significantly the time from customer order to delivery of finished product  or both 
to reduce costs  we have moved labor intensive assembly operations to our facility in mexico 
to shorten delivery times  we have developed proprietary systems for order processing  materials handling  tracking  labeling and invoicing and innovative procedures to expedite assembly and distribution operations 
many of these systems and procedures require continuing enhancement and development 
there is a possibility that our systems and procedures may not continue to be adequate and meet their objectives 
if demand for our clave products were to decline significantly  we might not be able to recover the cost of our expensive automated molding and assembly equipment and tooling  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our production tooling is relatively expensive  with each module  which consists of an automated assembly machine and the molds and molding machines which mold the components  costing several million dollars or more 
most of the modules are for the clave and the integrated y clave 
if the demand for either of these products changes significantly  as might happen with the loss of a customer or a change in product mix  it might be necessary for us to account for the impairment in value of the production tooling because its cost may not be recovered through production of saleable product 
because we depend to a significant extent on our founder for new product concepts  the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend for new product concepts primarily on dr 
george a 
lopez  our founder  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
dr 
lopez has conceived of substantially all of our current and proposed new products and the systems and procedures to be used in the custom iv products and their manufacturing 
we believe that the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we have substantial cash balances and liquid investments in interest sensitive securities  continued low interest rates would have an adverse effect on our investment income and on our net income 
we have accumulated a substantial balance of cash and liquid investments principally through profitable operations and the exercise of stock options 
these balances amounted to million at december   almost all of which was invested in interest sensitive securities 
such securities consist principally of corporate preferred stocks and federal tax exempt state and municipal government debt securities 
dividend and interest rates are reset at auction mostly at seven to forty nine day intervals  with a small portion resetting at longer intervals up to one year 
short term interest rates have been the lowest in generations for the past four years  and not withstanding recent increases  are still low by historic standards 
in  our investment income was million on average on cash and liquid investments of approximately million 
in  the comparable numbers were approximately million and million  respectively  investment income was approximately million lower than it would have been at the rates in continued low interest rates would continue to have an adverse effect on our investment income 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to defend and enforce our patents  if our products are found to infringe patents owned by others or if the cost of patent litigation becomes excessive 
we have patents on certain products  software and business methods  and pending patent applications on other intellectual property and inventions 
there is no assurance  however  that patents pending will issue or that the patent protection from patents which have issued or may issue in the future will be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar devices  that such patents  if challenged  will be upheld by the courts or that we will be able to prove infringement and damages in litigation 
we are substantially dependent upon the patents on our proprietary products such as the clave to prevent others from manufacturing and selling products similar to ours 
we have instituted litigation against b 
braun medical inc and alaris medical systems  inc  a part of cardinal health  inc  for violating our patents and we are seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages 
we believe those violations had and continue to have an adverse effect on our sales 
failure to prevail in those litigations or litigation we may bring against others violating our patents in the future would adversely affect our sales 
we have faced patent infringement claims related to the clave and the clc we believe the claims had no merit  and all have been settled or dismissed 
we may also face claims in the future 
any adverse determination on these claims related to the clave or other products  if any  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we from time to time become aware of newly issued patents on medical devices which we review to evaluate any infringement risk 
we are aware of a number of patents for iv connection systems that have been issued to others 
while we believe these patents will not affect our ability to market our products  there is no assurance that these or other issued or pending patents might not interfere with our right or ability to manufacture and sell our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
patent infringement litigation  which may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others  can be expensive and may involve a substantial commitment of our resources which may divert resources from other uses 
adverse determinations in litigation or settlements could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties  could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or could fail to prevent competitors from manufacturing products similar to ours 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 
our ability to market our products in the united states and other countries may be adversely affected if our products or our manufacturing processes fail to qualify under applicable standards of the fda and regulatory agencies in other countries 
government regulation is a significant factor in the development  marketing and manufacturing of our products 
our products are subject to clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda under a number of statutes including the food  drug and cosmetics act fdc act 
each of our current products has qualified  and we anticipate that any new products we are likely to market will qualify  for clearance under the fda s expedited pre market notification procedure pursuant to section k of the fdc act 
there is no assurance  however  that new products developed by us or any manufacturers that we might acquire will qualify for expedited clearance rather than a more time consuming pre market approval procedure or that  in any case  they will receive clearance from the fda 
fda regulatory processes are time consuming and expensive 
uncertainties as to the time required to obtain fda clearances or approvals could adversely affect the timing and expense of new product introductions 
in addition  we must manufacture our products in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda has broad discretion in enforcing the fdc act  and noncompliance with the act could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from warning letters  product detentions  device alerts or field corrections to mandatory recalls  seizures  injunctive actions and civil or criminal penalties 
if the fda determines that we have seriously violated applicable regulations  it could seek to enjoin us from marketing our products or we could be otherwise adversely affected by delays or required changes in new products 
in addition  changes in fda  or other federal or state  health  environmental or safety regulations or in their application could adversely affect our business 
to market our products in the european community ec  we must conform to additional requirements of the ec and demonstrate conformance to established quality standards and applicable directives 
as a manufacturer that designs  manufactures and markets its own devices  we must comply with the quality management standards of en iso en 
those quality standards are similar to the fda s quality system regulations but incorporate the quality requirements for product design and development 
manufacturers of medical devices must also be in conformance with ec directives such as council directive eec medical device directive and their applicable annexes 
those regulations assure that medical devices are both safe and effective and meet all applicable established standards prior to being marketed in the ec 
once a manufacturer and its devices are in conformance with the medical device directive  the ce mark maybe affixed to its devices 
the ce mark gives devices an unobstructed entry to all the member countries of the ec 
we cannot assure that we will continue to meet the requirements for distribution of our products in europe 
distribution of our products in other countries may be subject to regulation in those countries  and there is no assurance that we will obtain necessary approvals in countries in which we wants to introduce our products 
product liability claims could be costly to defend and could expose us to loss 
the use of our products exposes us to an inherent risk of product liability 
patients  healthcare workers or healthcare providers who claim that our products have resulted in injury could initiate product liability litigation seeking large damage awards against us 
costs of the defense of such litigation  even if successful  could be substantial 
we maintain insurance against product liability and defense costs in the amount of  per occurrence 
there is no assurance that we will successfully defend claims  if any  arising with respect to products or that the insurance we carry will be sufficient 
a successful claim against us in excess of insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect us 
furthermore  there is no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
our stockholder rights plan  provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
on july   our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan the plan and  pursuant to the plan  declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on july  the plan was amended in under its current provisions  each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one hundredth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock  no par value  at a purchase price of per one one hundredth of a share  subject to adjustment 
the plan is designed to afford the board a great deal of flexibility in dealing with any attempted takeover of and will cause persons interested in acquiring us to deal directly with the board  giving it an opportunity to negotiate a transaction that maximizes stockholder values 
the plan may  however  have the effect of discouraging persons from attempting to acquire us 
investors should refer to the description of the plan in our current report to the securities and exchange commission on form k dated july  filed july   as updated by our current report dated january  filed february   and the terms of the rights set forth in an amended and restated rights agreement  dated as of may  between icu medical  inc and mellon investor services  llc  as rights agent  which are filed as an exhibit to the may  form a a 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  the board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and fix the rights and preferences thereof  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control otherwise desired by the stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile due to many factors 
the market for small market capitalization companies can be highly volatile  and we have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock in the past 
in  our trading range was from a high of per share to a low of per share 
we believe that factors such as quarter to quarter fluctuations in financial results  differences between stock analysts expectations and actual quarterly and annual results  new product introductions by us or our competitors  changing regulatory environments  litigation  changes in healthcare reimbursement policies  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of common stock by insiders and substantial product orders could contribute to the volatility of the price of our common stock 
general economic trends unrelated to our performance such as recessionary cycles and changing interest rates may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
most of our common stock is held by  or included in accounts managed by  institutional investors or managers 
several of those institutions own or manage a significant percentage of our outstanding shares  with the ten largest interests accounting for of our outstanding shares 
if one or more of the institutions should decide to reduce or eliminate the position in our common stock  it could cause a decrease in the price of the common stock and such decrease could be significant 
for the past several years there has been a significant short position in our common stock  consisting of borrowed shares sold  or shares sold for future delivery which may not have been borrowed 
we do not know whether any of these short positions are covered by long positions owned by the short seller 
the short position  as reported by the nasdaq stock market on february  was  shares  or approximately of our outstanding shares 
any attempt by the short sellers to liquidate their position over a short period of time could cause very significant volatility in the price of our common stock 
continued compliance with recent securities legislation could be uncertain and could substantially increase our administrative expenses 
the sarbanes oxley act of imposed significant new requirements on public companies 
we have complied with most of these without undue effort or expense 
however  compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of requiring management to document and report on the effectiveness of internal controls and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit and report on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls has been extremely expensive 
although we expect to reduce the expense in  it is uncertain that we will be able to do so  particularly if we expand our businesses to new locations or acquire significant assets or operations from external sources 
further  there is no certainty that we will continue to receive unqualified reports on our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm and what actions might be taken by securities regulators if we are unable to obtain an unqualified report 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the expected amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
investment securities are all marketable and considered available for sale 
see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
under our current investment policies  the securities in which we invest have no significant difference between cost and fair value 
if our investment policies were to change  and there were differences between cost and fair value  that difference  net of tax effect  would be reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we record sales and related costs when ownership of the product transfers to the customer 
under the terms of most purchase orders  ownership transfers on shipment  but in some cases it transfers on delivery 
if there are significant doubts at the time of shipment as to the collectibility of the receivable  we defer recognition of the sale in revenue until the receivable is collected 
most of our customers are medical product manufacturers or distributors  although some are end users 
our only post sale obligations are warranty and certain rebates 
we warrant products against defects and have a policy permitting the return of defective products 
warranty returns have been insignificant 
customers  with certain exceptions  do not retain any right of return and there is no price protection with respect to unsold products  returns from customers with return rights have not been significant 
we accrue rebates as a reduction in revenue based on contractual commitments and historical experience 
adjustments of estimates of warranty claims  rebates or returns  which have not been  and are not expected to be material  affect current operating results when they are determined 
accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value 
an allowance is provided for estimated collection losses based on specific past due accounts for which we consider collection to be doubtful 
loss exposure is principally with international distributors for whom normal payment terms are long in comparison to those of our other customers and  to a lesser extent  domestic distributors 
many of these distributors are relatively small and we are vulnerable to adverse developments in their businesses that can hinder our collection of amounts due 
if actual collection losses exceed expectations  we could be required to accrue additional bad debt expense  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the accrual occurs 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we need to carry many components to accommodate our rapid product delivery  and if we misestimate demand or if customer requirements change  we may have components in inventory that we may not be able to use 
most finished products are made only after we receive orders except for certain standard non custom products which we will carry in inventory in expectation of future orders 
for finished products in inventory  we need to estimate what may not be saleable 
we regularly review inventory for slow moving items and write off all items we do not expect to use in manufacturing  or finished products we do not expect to sell 
if actual usage of components or sales of finished goods inventory is less than our estimates  we could be required to write off additional inventory  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the write off occurs 
property and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
the estimates of useful lives are significant judgments in accounting for property and equipment  particularly for molds and automated assembly machines that are custom made for us 
we may retire them on an accelerated basis if we replace them with larger or more technologically advanced tooling 
the remaining useful lives of all property and equipment are reviewed regularly and lives are adjusted or assets written off based on current estimates of future use 
as part of that review  property and equipment is reviewed for other indicators of impairment  but to date we have not encountered circumstances indicating the carrying amount of a significant asset  or group of assets  may not be recoverable 
an unexpected shortening of useful lives of property and equipment that significantly increases depreciation provisions  or other circumstances causing us to record an impairment loss on such assets  could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the related charges are recorded 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement r requires expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
we plan on adopting the modified prospective method  under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date 
the modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   however we adopted this on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our results of operations 
we have implemented all other new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business overview until the late s  our primary emphasis in product development  sales and marketing was disposable medical connectors for use in iv therapy  and our principal product was the clave 
in the late s  we commenced a transition from a product centered company to an innovative  fast  efficient  low cost manufacturer of custom iv systems  using processes that we believe can be readily applied to a variety of disposable medical devices 
this strategy enables us to capture revenue on the entire iv system  and not just a component of the system 
we are also increasing our efforts to acquire new products 
we acquired the punctur guard line of blood collection needles in  invested in a company developing a new medical device in  and are continuing to seek other opportunities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding acquisition opportunities  or in acquiring companies or products 
custom iv systems and new products will be of increasing importance to us in future years 
we expect clave products will grow in in the us  but at a slower percentage growth rate than prior to because of our large market penetration 
we also potentially face substantial increases in competition if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights 
growth for all of our products outside the us could be substantial  although to date it has been modest 
therefore  we will be directing increasing product development  acquisition  sales and marketing efforts to custom iv systems and new products in the iv and increasing our emphasis on the markets outside the us our largest customer has been hospira  which until april   was the hospital products division of abbott laboratories 
we believe the spin off of hospira from abbott is a positive development for us and will result in new business opportunities 
for clarity  all historical references to abbott and its hospital products division have been changed to hospira 
our relationship with hospira has been and will continue to be of singular importance to our growth 
in  approximately of our revenue was from sales to hospira 
while our sales to hospira declined to approximately of revenue in  we expect this percentage to increase again in the future both as a result of increased sales of clave products and iv sets to hospira and as a result of the new agreements with hospira as described below 
hospira has a significant share of the iv set market in the us  and provides us access to that market 
we expect that hospira will be important to our growth for clave  custom iv systems  and our other products in the us and also outside the us on february   we entered into a twenty year manufacturing  commercialization and development agreement mcda with hospira 
under the mcda and related agreements  which we expect to close early in the second quarter of  we will acquire hospira s salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility  related capital equipment and certain inventories for approximately million in cash  and produce for sale to hospira on an exclusive basis substantially all the products manufactured at that plant 
the majority of the products we will be producing under the mcda are hospira s critical care products  which include medical devices such as catheters  angiography kits and cardiac monitoring systems 
we estimate that sales under this agreement will exceed million in  with only small profits in  with increasing sales and profits in future years 
however  this sales estimate is subject to a variety of factors and there can be no assurance that the prospective results will be indicative of future performance or that actual results will not vary materially from this estimate 
we believe that achievement of our growth objectives  both within the us  and outside the us  will require increased efforts by us in sales and marketing and product development  and we started increasing expenditures in those areas during there is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy 
the custom iv systems market is still small and we could encounter customer resistance to custom products 
further  we could encounter increased competition as other companies see opportunity 
product development or acquisition efforts may not succeed  and even if we do develop or acquire products  there is no assurance that we will achieve profitable sales of such products 
an adverse change in our relationship with hospira  or a deterioration of hospira s position in the market  could have an adverse effect on us 
increased expenditures for sales and marketing and product acquisition and development may not yield desired results when expected  or at all 
while we have taken steps to control these risks  there are certain of those risks which may be outside of our control  and there is no assurance that steps we have taken will succeed 
overview of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net revenues by product as a percentage of total net revenues product line clave custom and generic iv systems punctur guard clc other products license  royalty and revenue share total most custom iv systems include one or more claves 
total clave sales including custom iv systems with at least one clave were of net revenue in and of net revenue in we sell our products to independent distributors and through agreements with hospira the hospira agreements and certain other medical product manufacturers 
most independent distributors handle the full line of our products 
through  hospira purchased clave products  principally bulk  non sterile connectors  and the clc in addition  we sell custom iv systems to hospira under a program referred to as setsource 
in january  we announced the execution of amendments to our existing agreements with hospira 
the amendments extend the terms of our agreements to and provide hospira with conditional exclusive and nonexclusive rights to distribute all existing icu medical products worldwide 
we signed another contract amendment with hospira in january to distribute our punctur guard line of blood collection needles in the us and the rest of the world 
we also sell certain other products to a number of other medical product manufacturers 
we believe that as healthcare providers continue to either consolidate or join major buying organizations  our success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on our ability  either independently or through strategic relationships such as our hospira relationship  to secure long term clave contracts with large healthcare providers and major buying organizations 
as a result of this marketing and distribution strategy we derive most of our revenues from a relatively small number of distributors and manufacturers 
the loss of a strategic relationship with a customer or a decline in demand for a manufacturing customer s products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in june  cardinal health  inc cardinal acquired alaris medical systems  inc alaris 
alaris manufactures a connector that competes with the clave 
cardinal is the largest distributor of healthcare products in the united states  and the companies have announced their intent to increase market share growth beyond what alaris might be able to achieve on its own 
we believe the ownership of alaris by cardinal could adversely affect our market share and the prices for our clave products 
we believe the success of the clave has motivated  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece  swabbable  needleless connectors that may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
we are aware of a number of such products 
we have patents covering the technology embodied in the clave and intend to enforce those patents as appropriate 
if we are not successful in enforcing our patents  competition from such products could adversely affect our market share and prices for our clave products 
in response to competitive pressure  we have been reducing prices to protect and expand our market  although overall pricing has been stable recently 
the price reductions to date have been more than offset by increased volume after excluding the effect of hospira s temporary reduction of purchases in we expect that the average price of our clave products may continue to decline 
there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
the federal needlestick safety and prevention act  enacted in november  modified standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration to require employers to use safety iv systems where appropriate to reduce risk of injury to employees from needlesticks 
we believe this law has had and will continue to have a positive effect on sales of our needleless systems and blood collection needles  although we are unable to quantify the current or anticipated effect of the law on our sales 
we are taking steps to reduce our dependence on our current proprietary products 
we are seeking to substantially expand our custom iv systems business through increased sales to medical product manufacturers and independent distributors 
under one of our hospira agreements  we manufacture all new custom iv sets for sale by hospira and jointly promote the products under the name setsource 
we also contract with group purchasing organizations and independent dealer networks for inclusion of our products among those available to members of those entities 
custom iv systems accounted for approximately million of net sales in  including net sales under the hospira setsource program of approximately million 
we expect continued increases in sales of custom i 
v 
systems 
also  in the fourth quarter of we acquired bio plexus 
inc bio plexus  whose principal products are blood collection needles  under the punctur guard name  that is designed to eliminate exposure to sharp  contaminated needles 
punctur guard product revenues in were million 
in  we invested in a company developing a new medical device  sales depend on the success of efforts to develop and market the device  and there can be no certainty that those efforts will succeed 
there is no assurance that any of these initiatives will continue to succeed 
we have an ongoing program to increase systems capabilities  improve manufacturing efficiency  reduce labor costs  reduce time needed to produce an order  and minimize investment in inventory 
these include use of automated assembly equipment for new and existing products  use of larger molds and molding machines  centralization of all proprietary molding in san clemente  expansion of our production facility in mexico  and the establishment of other production facilities outside the us we distribute products through three distribution channels 
net product revenues for each distribution channel were as follows channel medical product manufacturers independent domestic distributors international total quarterly results the healthcare business in the united states is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and activity tends to diminish somewhat in the summer months of june  july and august  when illness is less frequent than in winter months and patients tend to postpone elective procedures 
this typically causes seasonal fluctuations in our business 
in addition  we can experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers  which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels  and less by seasonality 
our expenses often do not fluctuate in the same manner as net sales  which may cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue 
year to year comparisons we present summarized income statement data in item selected financial data 
the following table shows  for the three most recent years  the percentages of each income statement caption in relation to revenues  and the percentage change in each caption in each year 
we currently calculate our gross profit percentage based on net sales  which includes only product sales and excludes non product revenue such as license fees 
see below for more information on non product revenue 
we present the alternative calculation based on net product revenue to give the reader a better view of product gross margins

distribution channels net sales to hospira were million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
clave sales to hospira decreased million  or to million from million principally because hospira had decreased its level of purchases to make a substantial reduction in its inventory of clave products 
although hospira was reducing its purchases  information provided by hospira indicates that its clave unit sales to its customers have continued to increase 
sales to hospira under the setsource program were approximately million in  compared to million in  or a increase 
net sales of the clc to hospira decreased by approximately million  to million in  because hospira was also reducing inventory levels of clc products 
although we expect sales to hospira to grow in the future  there is no assurance as to the amount of any of the future sales increases to hospira 
net sales to independent domestic distributors including canada decreased approximately to million in from million in this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in punctur guard product sales  partially offset by million and million of increases in clave and custom iv system sales  respectively 
the decrease in punctur guard product sales is primarily due to a decrease in unit sales and to pricing concessions on our punctur guard products to achieve a wider distribution 
we have been seeking increased sales through new outpatient provider contracts and new distribution focused on the lab market but the success of these efforts is not assured 
the clave and custom iv system sales increases were both principally due to an increase in unit volume 
as part of our program to increase sales of custom iv systems  we have been encouraging customers to purchase custom iv systems that include clave connectors  rather than purchasing only the clave connectors 
there is no assurance as to the amount of any future sales increases to the independent domestic distributors 
net sales in our international markets excluding canada were million in  compared to million in the increase in was due primarily to a million increase in clave and custom iv sales  partially offset by a million decrease in punctur guard product sales 
in  we experienced a slowing of distributor orders while they reduced clave inventory levels 
orders in most of our international markets have returned to more normal levels in this and the expansion of our business accounted for the increase in international sales of clave 
the increase of custom iv systems was attributable primarily to an increase in unit volume 
the decrease in sales of punctur guard products is primarily due to a decrease in unit sales and to pricing concessions on our punctur guard products to achieve a wider distribution 
we expect increases in foreign sales in the future in response to increased sales and marketing efforts including additional business development managers 
also  we believe we may see a positive impact beginning from our recent amendments to the hospira contracts although any such impact may depend upon how quickly hospira expands its international distribution 
there is no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
product and other revenue total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems decreased approximately million or to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in unit shipments of clave products to hospira  partially offset by an increase in unit shipments to our domestic and international distributors 
sales of custom iv systems including one or more clave connectors and clave products combined declined by million from million in to million in the decrease was caused by hospira s lower purchases of clave products 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in changed little from  and while we expect some decrease in  we expect the decreases to be minimal 
we expect growth in clave unit and dollar sales volume in in all of our distribution channels 
we believe the market for these products will continue to grow 
however  there is no assurance that the expectations will be realized 
in october  we commenced production of the microclave 
it is smaller than the existing clave but is functionally similar 
we market it as an extension of the clave product line for use where its smaller size is advantageous  such as pediatric care 
sales are included in clave product sales 
net sales of custom and generic iv systems  which included custom iv sets  both with a clave and without a clave  were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the setsource program with hospira accounted for approximately of the increase  with most of the balance in sales to independent domestic and international distributors 
the increase is due to our continued growth with this product which is because we are able to give the customer customization instead of standard sets at a competitive price 
we acquired the punctur guard product line and technology with the purchase of bio plexus on october  we now produce the punctur guard line of products and also license the technology to two medical device manufacturers for use in catheters 
after our acquisition of bio plexus on october   we made significant improvements to the punctur guard products and manufacturing processes 
we did not actively promote sales of those products until completion of those product improvements 
we completed improvements on the winged set products and re launched them in mid we completed initial improvements on the tubular blood collection needle and started selling the improved product in late we completed additional improvements to this product line in sales of punctur guard products excluding royalties were million in compared to million for the decline was due to a decrease in unit sales and to pricing concessions to achieve wider distribution 
we are currently concentrating our sales and marketing efforts for the winged set product on outpatient provider contracts and the lab market 
however  we have been unable to achieve success with the blood collection needle bcn  and we are not currently focusing any significant sales and marketing efforts on the bcn 
there is no assurance as to future sales of punctur guard products 
in the fourth quarter of we accelerated the depreciation and amortization of the net cost of equipment and intangible assets for impairment related to the bcn  resulting in a charge of approximately million 
net sales of the clc declined to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease is due to lower purchases by hospira and a small price decrease 
we expect sales of the clc to increase moderately in and later years  but there is no assurance as to the amount or timing of future clc sales 
other revenue consists of license  royalty and revenue share income  and is presented separately in our financial statements since the fourth quarter if  amounts were not significant prior to this 
other revenue in was comprised of million in royalties received from other companies use of punctur guard technology  million for safeline revenue share payments from b 
braun and million of license revenue 
other revenue in was comprised of million in punctur guard royalties  million of safeline revenue share and one time license fees of million 
we expect to receive ongoing royalties for the use of punctur guard technology and safeline revenue share payments from b 
braun as well as additional payments under another license of approximately million per quarter for another three years 
we may receive other license fees or royalties in the future for the use of our technology 
we give no assurance as to amounts or timing of any future payments  or whether such payments will be received 
gross margin for  calculated on net sales and excluding other revenue  was compared to in our overall standard gross margins are approximately although they can vary depending on product mix 
in  gross margins were adversely affected by approximately eight percentage points because of the curtailment in production of clave products due to reduced shipments to hospira  which resulted in unabsorbed overhead  approximately three percentage points by punctur guard operations  which currently have a lower gross margin than most of our other products and which were also adversely affected by reduced production levels  and the new facility in italy which was operating substantially below full capacity 
in  gross margins were adversely affected by two temporary factors  the principal one relating to improvements on our automated production in san clemente during the third quarter  which resulted in a period of unabsorbed overhead 
the other related to gross margins on our punctur guard products being lower than most of our other products we expect gross margins to be somewhat depressed in the first quarter of because production will be curtailed as we reduce inventories 
after the first quarter  we expect gross margins to improve  but only to somewhat below our overall standard because of the continuing effect of punctur guard operations 
we give no assurance as to the amount or timing of future improvements to our gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in  increased million to million and was approximately of revenue in as compared with million  or of revenue in the increase was primarily due to increased corporate administrative costs  which was principally comprised of million of costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  million of non recurring patent amortization  and increased information technology costs  partially offset by a reduction in costs from our connecticut office we expect sg a costs to be approximately the same in as they were in as increases in sales and marketing costs are expected to offset decreases in sarbanes oxley compliance costs and lower amortization costs 
research and development expenses r d in were million or of revenue compared to million  or of revenue  in the increase was primarily comprised of million of in process r d related to the investment in a company developing a new medical device and the costs of million incurred by this company from september through december  post acquisition 
the device is being designed for use in screening for heart disease 
the device is at a very early stage of design  uses new technology  and completion of a marketable device is expected to take at least several years 
we have agreed to invest an additional million in that company if certain milestones are achieved by november  excluding in process r d  we estimate that r d costs will increase in to support on going new product development  r d under the mcda with hospira 
various product and process improvements and r d costs in the new investment company 
however  r d costs could differ from these estimates and the r d may not be completed as expected 
investment income increased million in as compared with  principally because of an increase in invested funds including finance loans and an increase in overall yield 
minority interest of million in represents the minority interest share of the million net loss of the company developing a new medical device for use in screening for heart disease 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in was  a decrease from in the decrease was principally because tax exempt interest and dividends were a higher proportion or income before income taxes  thereby reducing the overall rate  and state tax credits  those reductions were partially offset by the effect of losses of the company developing the new medical device because those losses are not included in our consolidated tax return 
we expect an increase in the effective tax rate in comparison of to in we had total revenues of million  which was million  or  higher than the total revenues of million reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of custom iv systems  which increased million  punctur guard  which increased by million and clave products  which increased by million 
distribution channels net sales to hospira were million in  compared to million in  an increase of 
clave sales to hospira increased to million from million principally because of an increase in unit volume as the clave product penetration of hospira customer accounts increased 
sales of custom iv systems to hospira under the setsource program approximated million for the year  up from million in principally because of an increase in the number of units sold 
net sales of the clc to hospira increased to approximately million from million in net sales of rhino decreased to million for in connection with the november settlement of our contract litigation against b 
braun  we terminated the manufacture and supply agreement under which we sold clave products to b 
braun effective december  we sold virtually no clave products to b 
braun in as compared with million in net sales to independent domestic distributors including canada increased approximately to million in from million in the increase was due principally to the inclusion of million of punctur guard product sales which included months of revenue compared to million in  which included revenue only for the last two months of the year following our acquisition of bio plexus on october  also contributing to this increase was a increase in custom iv systems  and a increase in clave product sales  both principally due to an increase in unit volume 
net sales to international distributors excluding canada were million in  as compared with million in the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in clave product sales as distributors slowed their orders to reduce their inventory levels 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in custom iv system product sales and punctur guard product sales 
product and other revenue total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately to million in from million in total net sales of clave products including custom iv systems with clave increased from million in to million in  or 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in unit shipments of clave products to hospira and our domestic distributors  offset by a decrease in unit shipments to our international distributors and the absence of shipments to b 
braun 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in changed little from net sales of custom and generic iv systems  which included custom iv sets  both with a clave and without a clave  were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
sales to hospira accounted for approximately of the increase  with most of the balance in sales to independent domestic and international distributors 
we acquired the punctur guard product line and technology with the purchase of bio plexus on october  sales of punctur guard products excluding royalties were million in compared to million for the last two months of net sales of the clc grew slightly from million in to million in  an increase of 
sales to hospira and domestic distributors accounted for all the growth offset by a decrease in sales to foreign distributors 
other revenue consisted principally of ongoing royalties received for other companies use of punctur guard technology of million  safeline revenue share payments from b 
braun of approximately million and one time license fees of million 
other revenue in consisted principally of payment for a fully paid up license to use certain of our patents of million received in december gross margin for  calculated on net sales and excluding other revenue  was as compared to in we believe this difference is principally due to two temporary factors  one relating to improvements in our automated production in san clemente during the third quarter which resulted in a period of unabsorbed overhead 
the other relates principally to gross margins in our punctur guard products being lower than most of our other products 
in the fourth quarter of gross margin had improved to selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in  excluding research and development expenses  increased to million and was approximately of revenue in as compared with million  or of revenue in a portion of the increase was because of the inclusion of bio plexus and a small increase in sales and marketing costs related to increased sales 
administrative costs were higher because of personnel additions and increased information technology expenses  but those higher costs were offset by decreased litigation expenses 
research and development expenses r d in increased to million and was of revenue in as compared to in spending was principally on new product development  product improvements to punctur guard  and software development to support manufacturing and distribution of custom and generic iv systems 
investment income decreased in as compared with  principally because of a decrease in the investment portfolio and declines in interest rates slightly offset by higher interest rates through our finance loans receivable 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in was  a decrease from in principally because of savings in state income taxes liquidity and capital resources during  our working capital increased by million to million from million 
the increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations  cash received from employee equity plans and a reduction in finance loans which was partially offset by the purchases of treasury stock and investment in property and equipment 
our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities position increased in by million to million from million at december  this is principally because the aggregate of cash provided by operating activities including tax benefits from exercise of stock options of million  cash provided by the company s employee equity plans of million and net receipts of million under finance loans exceeded the purchases of treasury stock of million and property and equipment of million 
operating activities our cash provided by operating activities tends to increase over time because of our positive operating results 
however  it is subject to fluctuations  principally from changes in net income  accounts receivable  inventories  current liabilities and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
normally the substantial majority of our accounts receivable are current or no more than thirty days past due 
in recent years  the majority of each quarter s sales have been in that last half of the quarter with the result that the amount of accounts receivable reported as of the end of each quarter tends to be higher than the amounts at other times during a quarter 
accounts receivable decreased from million in to million in  or  the decrease was principally because revenue in the fourth quarter of was less than revenue in the fourth quarter of we generally try to maintain a minimal amount of inventory of finished goods and work in process  but will maintain larger amounts of components classified as raw material acquired from third parties to avoid production delays if deliveries by our suppliers are late 
however  in order to avoid production inefficiencies caused by fluctuating production levels  we have begun to level out our production volumes and build finished goods of our standard non custom products to meet anticipated future orders 
inventories increased million from million at december  to million at december  principally because of our decision in early to increase our production volumes beyond current orders and increase our finished goods inventories in anticipation of higher sales in the latter part of those higher sales did not materialize 
our finished good inventory increased in  but we expect to reduce our finished good inventories substantially by the end of the first quarter of in  our prepaid taxes increased by million to million 
this increase was due to an overestimate of taxable earnings in the first half of  resulting in a overpayment carried as a prepaid tax 
we intend to seek a refund of part of the overpayment and apply the balance to estimated liabilities 
the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  which we believe are more properly related to the sale of our stock which is a financing activity  fluctuates based principally on when employees choose to exercise their vested stock options 
tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in were million on the exercise of options to acquire  shares as compared to million in on the exercise of options to acquire  shares and million in on the exercise of options to acquire  shares 
once we adopt revisions to sfas r on accounting for share based payments  these tax benefits will be reflected in financing activities 
we expect that sales of our products will grow in if sales continue to increase  working capital is expected to increase to fund the increase in operations 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect the use of working capital to fund our operations to continue to increase 
investing activities in the year ended december   we used cash of million in investing activities 
this was comprised primarily of purchases of property and equipment of million and the net purchases of liquid investments of million utilizing cash generated by operations in excess of other investing needs  partially offset by the net cash receipt of million in finance loans 
capital expenditures in of million were principally to maintain capacity and for building efficiency improvements 
upon completing an evaluation of the design and capacity of our manufacturing facilities  we estimate that our current facilities will be adequate through  but that production after may require additional clean room facilities for molding and automated assembly 
we expect to decide in the future how to meet the need for any additional facilities and the location of additional clean room facilities for molding and automated assembly 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million and will be paid from cash we generate from operations 
we expect the million will be spent on molds  molding equipment and automated assembly equipment  computers and software to maintain current capacity including targeted growth for amounts of spending are estimates and actual spending may substantially differ from those amounts 
these amounts exclude any spending under the mcda 
icu finance  inc is a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary that we established in as a licensed commercial lender to provide financing to companies involved in distribution of healthcare products and provision of healthcare services 
loans were made only to credit worthy healthcare entities and are fully secured by real and personal property 
at december   it had million in loans outstanding 
scheduled maturities are million  million  million and million 
weighted average maturity principal and interest at december  was years and the weighted average interest rate was 
in october  we discontinued new lending activities 
as of december   we have no unfunded lending commitments on existing credit facilities 
financing activities in  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million  as compared with  shares purchased for million in we may purchase additional shares in the future 
however  future purchases  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors 
cash provided by stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  was million in as compared with million in  options were exercised on  shares in as compared with  shares in we have a large cash and liquid investment position generated from profitable operations and stock sales  principally from the exercise of employee stock options 
we maintain this position to fund our growth  meet increasing working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  repurchase our common stock and potentially to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that may arise 
our primary investment goal is capital preservation  as further described in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

first  one should consider the factors and risks described in the statements themselves 
those factors are uncertain  and if one or more of them turn out differently than we currently expect  our operating results may differ materially from our current expectations 
second  one should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk factors in this annual report to the securities and exchange commission 
third  our actual future operating results are subject to other important factors that we cannot predict or control  including among others the following general economic and business conditions  the effect of price and safety considerations on the healthcare industry  competitive factors  such as product innovation  new technologies  marketing and distribution strength and price erosion  unanticipated market shifts and trends  the impact of legislation affecting government reimbursement of healthcare costs  changes by our major customers and independent distributors in their strategies that might affect their efforts to market our products  unanticipated production problems  and the availability of patent protection and the cost of enforcing and of defending patent claims 
we disclaim any obligation to update the statements or to announce publicly the result of any revision to any of the statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a portfolio of corporate preferred stocks and federal tax exempt state and municipal government debt securities 
the securities are all investment grade and we believe that we have virtually no exposure to credit risk 
dividend and interest rates reset at auction for most of the securities from between seven and forty nine day intervals  with some longer but none beyond twelve months  so we have very little market risk  that is  risk that the fair value of the security will change because of changes in market interest rates 
the securities are readily saleable at par at auction dates  and can normally be sold at par between auction dates 
as of december   we had no declines in the market value of these securities 
our future earnings are subject to potential increase or decrease because of changes in short term interest rates 
generally  each one percentage point change in the discount rate will cause our overall yield to change by two thirds to three quarters of a percentage point  depending upon the relative mix of federal tax exempt securities and corporate preferred stocks in the portfolio and market conditions specific to the securities in which we invest 
at december  we had outstanding commercial loans of approximately million 
loans were made only to credit worthy parties and are fully secured by real and personal property 
we plan to hold the loans until maturity or payoff 
as of december   maturities were four years or less and the weighted average maturity principal and interest payments was years 
because of the relatively small amount of the commercial loans  market risk is not significant to our financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk for financial instruments on our balance sheet  which consist of cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable  is not significant 
sales from the us to foreign distributors are all denominated in us dollars 
we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities in several countries and we conduct business transactions denominated in various foreign currencies  principally the euro  british pound  and mexican peso 
cash and receivables in those countries have been insignificant and are generally offset by accounts payable in the same foreign currency 
we expect that in the future  with the growth of our european distribution operation  that net euro denominated instruments will increase 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposures 
our exposure to commodity price changes relates primarily to certain manufacturing operations that use resin 
we manage our exposure to changes in those prices through our procurement and supply chain management practices and the effect of price changes have not been material 
we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale  and all such materials and products are readily available
