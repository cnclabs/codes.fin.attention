coated pipe partners with its primary customer  a pipe manufacturer  to market a fusion bonded epoxy coating  abrasion resistant coatings and internal linings for a wide variety of pipe dimensions for pipeline projects that typically extend for several miles 
the threaded products unit  located in houston  tx  cuts  threads and paints pipe primarily for water well products for the agriculture industry and municipal water authorities 
threaded products has also entered the micro pile business and threads pipe used in earth and other structural stabilization 
developments the company had reached an agreement in to sell  modify and install its former newport pipe coating machinery and equipment 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the installation of these assets and  as a result  recognized a million gain on net proceeds of million 
the company experienced unprecedented increases in steel prices in  affecting most of the company s businesses 
due primarily to these higher steel prices  the company s results included a million lifo charge  as compared to no lifo charge in this charge had no impact on the company s cash flow from operations  although the company will benefit by deducting lifo expenses for income tax purposes 
recent developments the company s cxt subsidiary was awarded a long term contract for the supply of prestressed concrete railroad ties to the union pacific railroad uprr 
cxt will upgrade its manufacturing equipment at its grand island  ne plant and build a new facility in tucson  az to accommodate the contract s requirements 
the uprr has agreed to purchase ties from the grand island  ne facility through december  and the tucson  az facility through december 
table of contents in january  the company amended its revolving credit agreement to extend its maturity to april the company is also working on a new long term credit and security agreement with its bank group 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets whereby goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are subject to annual impairment tests 
the impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step  which is used to identify potential impairment only  compares the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with its carrying value 
since quoted market prices are not readily available for the company s reporting units  the company estimates fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the process is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment testing must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
step two requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of goodwill  impairment must be recorded 
the company believes that the accounting estimates used in this testing are critical accounting estimates because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period affecting the fair value calculation which may have a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions require significant judgments related to anticipated revenues  and other internal and external economic conditions such as growth rate  discount rate and inflation 
at december  and  the goodwill on the company s balance sheet was million 
allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific 
table of contents customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  a nominal accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction products  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respectively 
slow moving inventory the company maintains reserves for slow moving inventory 
these reserves  which are reviewed and adjusted routinely  take into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used in calculating the reserve can change from period to period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
at december  and  the reserve for slow moving inventory was million 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of actual direct labor costs to estimated total direct labor costs 
as certain contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  the company s estimates of total costs and costs to complete have reasonably approximated actual costs incurred to complete contracts 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company estimates the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
the company believes these estimates are critical accounting estimates because they require the use of judgments due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process 
as a result  actual revenues and profits could differ materially from estimates 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions statement no 

the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and was 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 

table of contents the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  statement no 
requires that the company look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate used by the company was and for and  respectively 
deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
see note  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense benefit and net income loss 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas the company will begin recording compensation expense utilizing modified prospective application in its first quarter financial statements 
based on unvested awards at december   the company projects compensation expense will be approximately million  net of tax 
in october  the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
this act includes a tax deduction of up to percent when fully phased in of the lesser of a qualified production activities income  as defined in the act  or b taxable income after the deduction for the utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards 
this tax deduction is limited to percent of w wages paid by the taxpayer 
as a result of the act  an issue arose as to whether that deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction or a tax rate reduction under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
in december  the fasb issued fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
in fsp  the fasb stated that the qualified production activities deduction s characteristics are similar to special deductions illustrated in sfas because the qualified production activities deduction is contingent upon the future performance of specific activities  including level of wages 
accordingly  the fasb staff believes that the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas the fasb staff also observes that the special deduction should be considered by an enterprise in a measuring deferred taxes when graduated tax rates are a significant factor and b assessing whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
the company is currently assessing the impact this special deduction will have on its deferred taxes

in addition  the company has a receivable for accrued dividend income on preferred stock of approximately million 
the company owns approximately of the dm e 
in december  in conjunction with the issuance of series c preferred stock and warrants  the dm e ceased paying dividends on the series b shares 
the terms of the series b preferred stock state in the event that regular dividends are not paid timely  dividends accrue at an accelerated rate until those dividends are paid 
in addition  penalty interest accrues and compounds annually until such dividends are paid 
subsequent issuances of series c  c  and d preferred stock have all assumed distribution priority over the previous series  with series d not redeemable until as subsequent preferred series were issued  the company  based on its own valuation estimate  stopped recording the full amount due on all preferred series given the delay in anticipated realization of the asset and the priority of redemption of the various issuances 
the amount of dividend income not recorded was approximately million at december  the company will only recognize this income upon redemption of the respective issuances or payment of the dividends 
in june  the dm e announced its plan to build an extension from the dm e s existing line into the low sulfur coal market of the powder river basin in wyoming and to rebuild approximately miles of its existing track the project 
the estimated cost of this project is expected to be in excess of billion 
the surface transportation board stb approved the project in january in october  however  the th us circuit court of appeals remanded the matter to the stb and instructed the stb to address  in its environmental impact statement  the project s effects on air quality  noise and vibration  and preservation of historic sites 
on january   the th us circuit court of appeals denied petitions seeking a rehearing of the case 
if the project proves to be viable  management believes that the value of the company s investment in the dm e could increase significantly 
if the project does not come to fruition  management believes that the value of the company s investment is supported by the dm e s existing business 
in december  the dm e received a railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing rrif loan in the amount of million from the federal railroad administration 
funding provided by the year loan was used to refinance debt and upgrade infrastructure along parts of its existing route 
other matters specialty trackwork sales of the company s rail segment have declined since a decision was made in to terminate our relationship with a principal trackwork supplier 
in the third quarter of  we exchanged our minority interest and advances to this supplier for a million promissory note from the supplier s owner  with principal and accrued interest to be repaid beginning in january the value of this note was fully reserved and no gain or loss was recorded on this transaction 
in  it was determined that the note was not collectible and the note and related reserve were removed from the company s accounts 
the company s proportionate share of the unaudited financial results for this investment was immaterial for the 
table of contents years ended december   and during  and  the volume of business conducted with this supplier was million  million and million  respectively 
substantially all of the order backlog related to this supplier has been completed 
the union contract at our bedford  pa fabricated products facility expired on march  the employees are continuing to work under the terms of the expired contract while negotiations continue 
we believe we can successfully negotiate an extension to the contract without a work stoppage 
we continue to evaluate the overall performance of our operations 
a decision to down size or terminate an existing operation could have a material adverse effect on near term earnings but would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
outlook our cxt rail operation and allegheny rail products division are dependent on a class i railroad for a significant portion of their business 
in january  the cxt rail operation was awarded a long term contract from this class i railroad for the supply of prestressed concrete railroad ties 
cxt will upgrade its manufacturing equipment at its grand island  ne plant and build a new facility in tucson  az to accommodate the contracts requirements 
the class i railroad has agreed to purchase ties from the grand island facility through december  and the tucson  az facility through december steel is a key component in the products that we sell 
during most of  producers and other suppliers quoted continually increasing product prices and some of our suppliers experienced supply shortages 
since many of the company s projects can be six months to twenty four months in duration  we have  on occasion  found ourselves caught in the middle of some of these pricing and availability issues 
the high price of steel continues to impact our business  although the pricing volatility that we experienced in has moderated recently and we expect significantly less volatility in however  if this situation were to resurface  it could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in the second half of  our primary supplier of sheet piling improved its capability to provide a significantly larger amount of sheet piling than in previous years 
this supplier also increased the number of sections it provides to us  although there are still sections that remain unavailable 
while management s outlook is positive considering the developments in  additional sections are important for us to compete effectively in the structural steel market 
a substantial portion of the company s operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects 
significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the operating results of the company 
the most recent extension of the federal highway and transit bill tea is to expire may   as reauthorization of a successor bill continues to be delayed 
a new highway and transit bill is important to the future growth and profitability of many of our businesses 
our fabricated products and rail transit businesses continue to suffer from low volumes and are experiencing more competitive pressure due to the lack of new legislation 
additionally  government actions concerning taxation  tariffs  the environment  or other matters could impact the operating results of the company 
the company s operating results may also be affected negatively by adverse weather conditions
