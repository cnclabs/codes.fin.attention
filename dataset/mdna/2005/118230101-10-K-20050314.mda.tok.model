as discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates below  the partnership s initial integrity expenditures are capitalized as part of pipeline cost when such expenditures improve or extend the life of the pipeline or related assets 
subsequent integrity expenditures are expensed as incurred 
accordingly  over time  integrity expenditures will shift from capital to operating expenditures 
in  approximately million of integrity costs were charged to expense

interest payable on fixed long term debt obligations include semi annual payments required for the partnership s notes  its notes and its notes 
the partnership s obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans are discussed in footnote in the partnership s accompanying consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters the operating subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations  as well as the partnership s own standards relating to protection of the environment  cause the operating subsidiaries to incur current and ongoing operating and capital expenditures 
environmental expenses are incurred in connection with emergency response activities associated with the release of petroleum products to the environment from the partnership s pipelines and terminals  and in connection with longer term environmental remediation efforts which may involve groundwater monitoring and treatment 
the partnership regularly incurs expenses in connection with these environmental remediation activities 
in  the operating subsidiaries incurred operating expenses of million and  at december   had million accrued for environmental matters 
of the amount accrued at december   million was established in connection with the acquisition of the midwest pipelines and terminals where the partnership agreed to perform monitoring activities at its own expense related to certain active or potential remediation sites for those assets at december   the partnership estimates that approximately million of environmental expenditures will be covered by insurance 
these amounts have not been included in expense in the partnership s financial statements 
expenditures  both capital and operating  relating to environmental matters are expected to continue due to the partnership s commitment to maintaining high environmental standards and to increasingly rigorous environmental laws 
various claims for the cost of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and for damage to the environment resulting from the activities of the operating subsidiaries or their predecessors have been asserted and may be asserted in the future under various federal and state laws 
the general partner believes that the generation  handling and disposal of hazardous substances by the operating subsidiaries and their 
table of contents predecessors have been in material compliance with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements 
the total potential remediation costs to be borne by the operating subsidiaries relating to these clean up sites cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material 
with respect to certain sites  however  the operating subsidiary involved is one of several or as many as several hundred prps that would share in the total costs of clean up under the principle of joint and several liability 
although the partnership has made a provision for certain legal expenses relating to these and other environmental matters  the general partner is unable to determine the timing or outcome of any pending proceedings or future claims or proceedings 
see business environmental matters and legal proceedings 
competition and other business conditions several major refiners and marketers of petroleum products announced strategic alliances or mergers in recent years 
these alliances or mergers have the potential to alter refined product supply and distribution patterns within the operating subsidiaries market area resulting in both gains and losses of volume and revenue 
while the general partner believes that individual delivery locations within its market area may have significant gains or losses  it is not possible to predict the overall impact these alliances or mergers may have on the operating subsidiaries business 
however  the general partner does not believe that these alliances or mergers will have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations or financial condition 
certain changes in refined petroleum product specifications are likely to impact the transportation of refined petroleum products over the next several years 
methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  a gasoline component frequently used to meet gasoline oxygenate requirements for air pollution control purposes  has been banned for use in certain states 
to the extent that ethanol or other similar oxygenates not shipped by pipeline are substituted for mtbe  this may result in a reduction in gasoline volumes delivered in the partnership s service area 
the partnership is unable to quantify the amount by which its transportation volumes might be affected by the discontinuance of mtbe 
in addition  new requirements for the use of ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd fuel  which will be phased in commencing in through  could require significant capital expenditures at certain locations in order to permit the partnership to handle this new product grade 
the partnership is finalizing plans to make the necessary modifications to its facilities to be able to transport ulsd efficiently 
it is not expected that these expenditures will have a materially adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the partnership completed its annual negotiation of its insurance program and included the midwest pipelines and terminals in the group of assets covered by the partnership s property and environmental insurance policies 
as part of this negotiation  the partnership increased the per occurrence deductible payable by the partnership from million to million

amounts deposited in the escrow account are returned to the partnership when the value of the services company lp units returns to an amount which exceeds the minimum 
at december   the value of the lp units was approximately million  which exceeded the minimum requirement 
the proceeds from the issuance of the esop notes on may  were used to refinance services company s notes which were originally issued to purchase services company common stock 
services company common stock is released to employee accounts in the proportion that current payments of principal and interest on the esop notes bear to the total of all principal and interest payments due under the esop notes 
individual employees are allocated shares based on the ratio of their eligible compensation to total eligible compensation 
eligible compensation generally includes base salary  overtime payments and certain bonuses 
except for the period march  through november   services company stock held in employee accounts received stock dividends in lieu of cash 
the esop was amended to eliminate the payment of stock dividends on allocations made after february  based upon provisions contained in the american jobs creation act of  the plan was amended further to reinstate this feature on allocations made after november  the partnership contributed  lp units to services company in august in exchange for the elimination of the partnership s obligation to reimburse the prior general partner and its parent for certain executive compensation costs  a reduction of the incentive compensation paid by the partnership to the prior general partner  and other changes that made the esop a less expensive fringe benefit for the partnership 
funding for the esop notes is provided by distributions that services company receives on the lp units that it owns and from cash payments from the partnership  which are required to cover any shortfall between the distributions that services company receives on the lp units that it owns and amounts currently due under the esop notes the top up reserve  except that the partnership has no obligation to fund the accelerated portion of the esop notes upon a default 
the partnership will also incur esop related costs for routine administrative costs and taxes associated with annual taxable income or the sale of lp units  if any 
total esop related costs charged to earnings were million in  million in and million in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to select appropriate accounting principles from those available  to apply those principles consistently and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect revenues and associated costs as well as reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
approximately of the partnership s consolidated assets consist of property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment consists of pipeline and related transportation facilities and equipment  including land  rights of way  buildings and leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment 
pipeline assets are generally self constructed  using either contractors or the partnership s own employees 
additions and improvement to the pipeline are capitalized based on the cost of the improvement while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
pipeline integrity expenditures are capitalized the first time such expenditures are incurred  when such expenditures improve or extend the life of the pipeline or related assets 
subsequent integrity expenditures are expensed as incurred 
during  and  the partnership capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of integrity expenditures 
in  the partnership also charged approximately million of similar integrity expenditures to expense  which was the first year that significant subsequent integrity expenditures were incurred 
over the next several years  the partnership expects integrity expenditures  both capital and operating  to range between million and million per year 
during this time  the portion of expenditures capitalized is expected to decrease and the portion recorded as expense is expected to increase  including approximately million which is expected to be expensed in as discussed under environmental matters above  the operating partnerships are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
environmental expenditures 
table of contents that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations  and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or clean ups are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with the partnership s commitment to a formal plan of action 
accrued environmental remediation related expenses include estimates of direct costs of remediation and indirect costs related to the remediation effort  such as compensation and benefits for employees directly involved in the remediation activities and fees paid to outside engineering  consulting and law firms 
the partnership maintains insurance which may cover certain environmental expenditures 
during  the operating partnerships incurred operating expenses  net of insurance recoveries  of million and  at december   had million accrued for environmental matters 
of the amount accrued at december   approximately million was established in connection with the acquisition of the midwest pipelines and terminals where the partnership agreed to perform monitoring activities at its own expense related to certain active or potential remediation sites for those assets 
the environmental accruals are revised as new matters arise  or as new facts in connection with environmental remediation projects require a revision of estimates previously made with respect to the probable cost of such remediation projects 
in the event a known environmental liability results in expenditures that exceed the amount that has been accrued in connection with the matter  the additional expenditures would result in an increase in expenses and a reduction in income  in the period when the additional expense is incurred 
based on its experience  however  the partnership believes that the amounts it has accrued for the future costs related to environmental liabilities is reasonable 
in connection with the acquisition of the midwest pipelines and terminals  the partnership determined that the transaction represented the acquisition of various assets  and not the acquisition of a business  as that term is defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations 
accordingly  the partnership allocated the cost of the assets acquired  which consisted principally of the purchase price of million  the direct costs of acquisition and the environmental monitoring liabilities assumed with the purchase  to the assets acquired using appraised values established in consultation with a qualified appraiser 
in conjunction with the appraisal  the partnership determined that substantially all of the value of the purchase related to the physical assets acquired  which are generally depreciated over years 
allocations of value to other assets or differently among the various physical assets could have resulted in different depreciation charges in future years for the assets acquired 
additionally  adjustments to the environmental monitoring liability established in conjunction with the purchase will result in increases or decreases in net income by the amount of any such adjustment 
management continues to evaluate on an ongoing basis the amounts required for environmental monitoring activities
