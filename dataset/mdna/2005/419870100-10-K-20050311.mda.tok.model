item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hei pages to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with hei s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the general discussion of hei s consolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment discussions that follow 
executive overview and strategy the company s three strategic objectives are to operate the electric utility and bank subsidiaries for long term growth  maintain the annual dividend and increase the company s financial flexibility by strengthening the balance sheet and maintaining credit ratings 
hei  through its electric utility subsidiaries  supplies power to of the hawaii electric public utility market 
hei also provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its bank subsidiary  asb  hawaii s third largest financial institution based on asset size 
in  income from continuing operations was million  compared to million in basic earnings per share from continuing operations were per share in  down from due primarily to an after tax charge of million  or per share  due to a june tax ruling and subsequent settlement see bank franchise taxes sections below  and a increase in weighted average common shares outstanding due primarily to a march common stock offering 
partially offsetting the tax charge were lower financing costs at hei corporate and the electric utilities and a reduction in asb s allowance for loan losses of million after tax in  compared with an increase of million after tax in the future success of the company will be heavily influenced by hawaii s economy  which is driven by tourism  the federal government including the military  real estate and construction 
real gross state product grew by an estimated in and is projected by the state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism dbedt to grow by in shareholder dividends are declared and paid quarterly by hei at the discretion of hei s board of directors 
hei and its predecessor company  heco  have paid dividends continuously since the dividend has been stable at per share annually since split adjusted 
the indicated dividend yield at december  was 
hei s board and management believe that hei should achieve a payout ratio on a sustainable basis before it considers increasing the common stock dividend above its current level 
the dividend payout ratios based on net income for  and were  and payout ratios of  and based on income from continuing operations  respectively 
the high payout ratio for was primarily due to the charge to net income of million due to a june adverse tax ruling and subsequent settlement and an increased number of shares outstanding from the sale of million shares pre split of common stock in march without the bank franchise tax charge  the payout ratio for would have been based on income from continuing operations 
in the first half of  hei strengthened its balance sheet through a common stock sale and repayment and refinancing of debt  which significantly reduced financing costs 
hei s subsidiaries from time to time consider various strategies designed to enhance their competitive positions and to maximize shareholder value 
these strategies may include the formation of new subsidiaries or the acquisition or disposition of businesses 
the company may from time to time be engaged in preliminary discussions  either internally or with third parties  regarding potential transactions 
management cannot predict whether any of these strategies or transactions will be carried out or  if so  whether they will be successfully implemented 
electric utility the electric utilities are vertically integrated and regulated by the puc 
the island utility systems are not interconnected  which requires that additional reliability be built into the systems  but also doesn t expose the utilities to the problems of inter ties 
the electric utilities strategic focus has been to meet hawaii s growing energy needs through a combination of diverse activities modernizing and adding needed infrastructure through capital 
table of contents investment  placing emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation  pursuing technology opportunities such as combined heat and power and taking the necessary steps to secure regulatory support for their plans 
reliability projects  including projects to increase generation reserves to meet growing peak demand  remain a priority for heco and its subsidiaries 
on oahu  heco is in the early permitting stages for a new generating unit  which is projected to be placed in service by  and is making progress with plans to build the east oahu transmission project eotp  a needed alternative route to move power from the west side of the island 
the two phases of the eotp are scheduled to be completed in and the puc has approved heco s plans for a new energy management system and a new dispatch center on oahu  which are scheduled to be completed in and  respectively  and are estimated to cost million 
if further puc approvals are obtained  new outage management and customer information systems will also be integrated 
on the island of hawaii  after years of delay  the two megawatt mw combustion turbines at keahole are operating 
on the island of maui  a necessary air permit was received  effective september   for the installation of an mw steam turbine at its maalaea power plant site 
further  the utilities are seeking puc approval for additional dsm rebate programs and pursuing combined heat and power agreements for onsite generation with specific customers  subject to puc approval 
major infrastructure projects can have a pronounced impact on the communities in which they are located 
the electric utilities continue to expand their community outreach and consultation process so they can better understand and evaluate community concerns early in the process 
with large power users in the electric utilities service territories  such as the us military  hotels and state and local government  management believes that retaining customers by maintaining customer satisfaction is a critical component in achieving kilowatthour kwh sales and revenue growth over time 
the electric utilities have established programs that offer these customers specialized services and energy efficiency audits to help them save on energy costs 
in november  heco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates  or million in annual base revenues  based on an return on average common equity 
see most recent rate requests hawaiian electric company  inc below 
the final decision and order for the last rate case on oahu was issued in the requested increase amount includes transferring the cost of existing energy conservation and efficiency programs from a surcharge to base rates  so the requested net increase to customers is  or million 
approximately million of the million net request is for the costs of new residential and commercial energy conservation and efficiency programs 
the balance of the request is largely for recovery of the costs of capital improvement projects  the proposed purchase of additional firm capacity and energy from kalaeloa partners  lp  other measures taken to address peak load increases  and increased operation and maintenance expenses see most recent rate requests below 
an interim decision is expected in the fourth quarter of the electric utilities long term plan to meet hawaii s future energy needs includes their support of a range of energy choices  including renewable energy and new power supply technologies such as distributed generation 
heco s subsidiary  renewable hawaii  inc rhi  has initial approval from the heco board of directors to fund investments by rhi of up to million in selected renewable energy projects to advance the long term development of renewable energy in hawaii 
net income for heco and its subsidiaries was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher kwh sales and lower financing costs  partly offset by higher expenses 
kwh sales growth was for assuming continuing strength in the us and hawaii economies  management expects higher kwh sales again in bank when asb was acquired by hei in  it was a traditional thrift with assets of billion and net income of about million 
asb has grown by both acquisition and internal growth since and finished with assets of billion and net income of million  including a million after tax charge for franchise taxes for prior years due to an adverse tax ruling 
excluding the million charge  net income would have been million in  compared to an adjusted million in see bank franchise taxes below 
the quality of asb s assets  the interest rate environment and the strategic transformation of asb have impacted and will continue to impact its financial results 

table of contents due to improved asset quality resulting from the strength in the hawaii economy and the real estate market  asb was able to recognize a million after tax negative provision for loan losses during asb s allowance as a percentage of average loans was at the end of this ratio falls between the benchmark ratios for national banks and thrifts  which is appropriate because asb s large residential mortgage portfolio is typical of a thrift and asb has added business and commercial real estate loans typical of commercial banks 
the allowance is adjusted continuously through the provision for loan losses to reflect factors such as charge offs  outstanding loan balances  loan grading  external factors affecting the national and hawaii economy  specific industries and sectors and interest rates  and historical and estimated loan losses 
the bank has been facing a challenging interest rate environment that has compressed margins 
the federal reserve bank s rate increases since mid have led to higher short term interest rates  while during the same period  long term interest rates have remained low or fallen  resulting in a flatter yield curve 
the higher short term interest rates have put upward pressure on deposit rates  while the low long term interest rates have held down asset yields  putting downward pressure on net interest margins 
if the flattening persists  or the yield curve becomes flatter  the potential for further compression of asb s margins will continue to be a concern 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  asb uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
asb then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
asb s key strategies include attracting and retaining low cost deposits  which lowers funding costs as of december   core deposits as a percentage of total liabilities were  compared to and as of december  and  respectively  diversifying its loan portfolio with higher yielding  shorter maturity loans or variable rate loans such as business  commercial real estate and consumer loans  which also creates a broader income stream for the bank  investing in mortgage related securities with short average lives  and taking advantage of the lower interest rate environment by lengthening the maturities of interest bearing liabilities 
asb has been undergoing a transformation  involving four major lines of business  to become a full service community bank serving both individual and business customers 
two have been completed commercial real estate and mortgage banking  and a third has made significant progress commercial banking 
the retail banking transformation has begun and is the most significant transformation due to the systems and processing improvements needed to move from a product centric to a customer centric focus 
the transformation project will require continued investment in people and technology 
asb s ongoing challenge is to manage expenses in order to keep increasing costs and increasing revenues in balance 
economic conditions because its core businesses provide local electric utility and banking services  hei s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy  which has been growing modestly 
growth in real gross state product was an estimated in and tourism is widely acknowledged as the largest component of the hawaii economy 
visitor days visitor arrivals multiplied by length of stay is a key indicator of the trend in kilowatthour sales 
in  visitor days hit a record million  exceeding the record set in of million by 
other key tourism statistics that indicate the general health of the industry and hawaii economy include hotel occupancy and visitor expenditures 
hotel occupancy rates averaged for the months ended november   higher than for the same period in visitor expenditures totaled billion for  increasing compared with key non tourism sectors in hawaii  particularly the military and residential real estate  are also fueling economic growth 
there has been a surge in defense spending over the last two years with a  or million  increase from to while statistics are not yet available  continued growth is expected with several key military developments projected to bring billion in construction projects into the state over the next several years 
these projects include preparations for an army stryker brigade  the arrival of eight c air force cargo planes and military housing renewal projects 
for  nearly million in federal defense dollars have been 
table of contents earmarked for hawaii  including million for military construction projects  in addition to payroll and daily operation funds 
although mortgage rates have been fluctuating recently  they are still low and continue to support real estate activity 
in  single family dwelling and condominium resale volumes on oahu were up and  respectively  while the december median sales prices were up and  respectively  compared with december in december  the median price of a single family dwelling on oahu was  on the island of hawaii was  and on maui was  in general  the construction industry in hawaii has been doing well 
private building permits were up overall for the months ended october  compared with same period in  and were also up in the residential up and additions and alterations up categories  but down in the commercial and industrial down category 
local economists anticipate growth in construction in and a increase for hawaii s improving economy is also reflected in other general economic statistics 
total salary and wage jobs increased by for the months ended november  compared with the same period in hawaii s unemployment rate of was well below the national average of as of november  dbedt also estimates real personal income growth of in compared to given these positive trends in key economic indicators  dbedt expects hawaii s economy to grow moderately by in  excluding inflation 
future growth in hawaii s economy is expected to be tied primarily to the rate of expansion in the mainland us and japan economies and continued growth in military spending  but remains vulnerable to uncertainties in the world s geopolitical environment

table of contents bank franchise taxes consolidated hei the results of operations include an after tax charge of million  or per share  due to a june tax ruling and subsequent settlement as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under asb state franchise tax dispute and settlement 
the following table presents a reconciliation of hei s consolidated net income to net income excluding this million charge in and including additional bank franchise taxes in prior periods as if the company had not taken a dividends received deduction on dividends paid by its real estate investment trust reit subsidiary 
management believes the adjusted information below presents results from continuing operations on a more comparable basis for the periods shown 
however  net income  or earnings per share  including these adjustments is not a presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and may not be comparable to presentations made by other companies or more useful than the gaap presentation included in hei s consolidated financial statements

taking into account the adjustments in the table above  hei s consolidated income from continuing operations would have increased for  compared to pension and other postretirement benefits for  the company s pension and other postretirement benefit collectively  retirement benefit plans assets generated a total return of  resulting in realized and unrealized gains of million 
realized and unrealized gains were million for and realized and unrealized losses were million for the market value of the retirement benefit plans assets as of december  was million 
the company made cash contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaling million in  million in and million in contributions are expected to total million in  but actual contributions may differ depending on the performance of the retirement benefit plans assets and the status of interest rates 
based on various assumptions eg  discount rate and expected return on plan assets  which are noted below and assuming no further changes in retirement benefit plan provisions  consolidated hei s  consolidated heco s and asb s accumulated other comprehensive income aoci balance  net of tax benefits  related to the minimum pension liability at december  and and retirement benefits expense  net of income taxes  for estimated will be  and and were  as follows

the estimated retirement benefits expenses  net of income tax benefits  are forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties  including the impact of plan changes during the year  if any  and the impact of actual information when received eg  actual participant demographics as of january  
if the company and consolidated heco are required to record substantially greater charges to aoci in the future  the electric utilities returns on average rate base rors could increase and exceed the puc authorized rors  which may ultimately result in reduced revenues and lower earnings 
further  if required to record significant charges to aoci  the company s and consolidated heco s financial ratios may deteriorate  which could result in security ratings downgrades and difficulty or greater expense in obtaining future financing 
there also may be possible financial covenant violations although there are no advances currently outstanding under any credit facility subject to financial covenants as certain bank lines of credit of the company and heco require that heco maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated equity to consolidated capitalization  excluding short term borrowings  of actual ratio of as of december   the company maintain a consolidated net worth  exclusive of intangible assets  of at least million actual net worth  exclusive of intangible assets  of billion as of december   and hei  on a non consolidated basis  maintain a ratio of indebtedness to capitalization of not more than actual ratio of as of december

in  the electric utilities revenues increased by  or million  from primarily due to higher energy prices million and a increase in kwh sales of electricity million 
the increase in kwh sales from was primarily due to higher customer usage due in part to the strength in hawaii s economy including higher real personal income  lower unemployment  higher visitor days  increased military activity and stronger real estate market and warmer weather probably resulting in more air conditioning usage 
cooling degree days were higher in compared to the higher energy prices are also reflected in the higher amount of customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues 
operating income was million lower than in mainly due to higher other expenses  primarily higher maintenance expenses

other expenses increased in due to a or million increase in other operation expense  a or million increase in maintenance expense  a or million increase in depreciation expense due to additions to plant in service in  and a or million increase in taxes  other than income taxes  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
other operation expenses increased in when compared to due primarily to higher administrative and general expenses  including increases in general liability reserves and workers compensation claims  and higher transmission and distribution line inspection expense  largely offset by lower retirement benefits expense and emission fees 
pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for the electric utilities were million lower than due primarily to the increase in plan assets as of december  compared to december  resulting from market performance and contributions of the electric utilities of million during maintenance expenses increased due to greater scope of generating unit overhauls  higher production corrective maintenance  and higher transmission and distribution maintenance work

as the electric utilities focused on capital expenditures to ensure reliability  ducted cables were installed to replace  rather than repair  direct buried cables when cable problems occurred 
other operation expense increased primarily due to higher retirement benefits expense and environmental expenses including higher emission fees 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs  net of amounts capitalized  for the electric utilities swung million over million expense in versus a million credit in  partly due to revised assumptions decreasing the discount rate basis points to and the long term rate of return on assets basis points to as of december  compared to december

in january  the department of health of the state of hawaii doh waived emissions fees  thus  emissions fees of million  which were accrued in  were reversed in the first quarter of most recent rate requests hei s electric utilities initiate puc proceedings from time to time to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs eg  higher energy conservation and efficiency program costs and higher purchased power capacity charges and the cost of plant and equipment  including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability 
as of february   the return on average common equity roace found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco decision and order d o issued on december   based on a test year  for hawaii electric light company  inc helco d o issued on february   based on a test year and for maui electric company  limited meco amended d o issued on april   based on a test year 
for  the simple average roaces calculated under the rate making method and reported to the puc for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
helco s actual roace for  which is substantially less than its allowed roace of  reflects in part helco s decision to discontinue accruing an allowance for funds used during construction afudc  effective december   on its ct and ct generating units that were installed at the keahole power plant 
although ct and ct are currently in service  helco s roace will continue to be negatively impacted by ct and ct as electric rates will not change for the unit additions until helco files a rate increase application and the puc grants helco rate relief 
as of february   the return on average rate base ror found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco  for helco and for meco d os noted above 
for  the simple average rors calculated under the rate making method for heco  helco and meco were  and after reduction of meco s revenues from shareholder incentives and lost margins in  respectively 
if required to record significant charges to aoci related to a minimum liability for retirement benefits  the electric utilities rors could increase and exceed the puc authorized rors  which may ultimately result in reduced revenues and lower earnings 

table of contents hawaiian electric company  inc the final d o for the last rate case on oahu was issued in in november  heco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates  or million in annual base revenues  based on a test year  a return on rate base and an return on average common equity 
the requested increase includes transferring the cost of existing energy conservation and efficiency programs from a surcharge line item on electric bills into base electricity charges 
excluding this surcharge transfer amount  the requested net increase to customers is  or million 
approximately million of the million net request is for the costs of new residential and commercial energy conservation and efficiency programs 
the balance of the request is largely for recovery of the costs of capital improvement projects completed since the last rate case  the proposed purchase of up to an additional mw of firm capacity and energy from kalaeloa partners  lp  which is subject to puc review and approval  other measures taken to address peak load increases arising out of economic growth and increasing electricity use  and increased operation and maintenance expenses 
the puc held a public hearing in january and evidentiary hearings are expected in the third quarter of an interim decision is expected in the fourth quarter of in october  heco filed an application with the puc for approval to change its depreciation rates based on a study of depreciation expense for and to change to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts 
in march  heco and the consumer advocate reached an agreement and the puc approved the agreement in september in accordance with the agreement  heco changed its depreciation rates and changed to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts effective september  under vintage amortization accounting  additions to electric utility plant in each year are grouped together in a vintage account for that year  as opposed to tracking each asset separately 
each vintage account is amortized over its average service life as determined in the depreciation study and  when fully amortized  the original cost of that vintage account is retired from utility plant in service 
if the new rates and accounting had been in effect from the beginning of  depreciation expense for the first eight months of would have been an estimated million lower

other regulatory matters demand side management programs lost margins and shareholder incentives 
heco  helco and meco s energy efficiency dsm programs  currently approved by the puc  provide for the recovery of lost margins and the earning of shareholder incentives 
lost margins are accrued and collected prospectively based on the programs forecast levels of participation  and are subject to two adjustments based on the actual level of participation and the results of impact evaluation reports 
the difference between the adjusted lost margins and the previously collected lost margins are subject to refund or recovery  with any over or under collection accruing interest at heco  helco or meco s authorized rate of return on rate base 
heco  helco and meco filed the impact evaluation report for the period with the puc in november and plan to adjust the lost margin recovery as required in the second quarter of past adjustments required for lost margins have not had a material effect on heco  helco or meco s financial statements 
shareholder incentives are accrued currently and collected retrospectively based on the programs actual levels of participation for the prior year 
beginning in  shareholder incentives collected are subject to retroactive adjustment based on the results of impact evaluation reports  similar to the adjustment process for lost margins 
demand side management programs agreements with the consumer advocate 
in october  heco and the consumer advocate finalized agreements  subject to puc approval  for the continuation of heco s three commercial and industrial dsm programs and two residential dsm programs until heco s next rate case 
these agreements were in lieu of heco continuing to seek approval of new year dsm programs and provided that dsm programs to be in place after heco s next rate case are to be determined as part of the case 
under the agreements  heco agreed to cap the recovery of lost margins and shareholder incentives if such recovery would cause heco to exceed its current authorized return on rate base ie the rate of return on rate base found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent rate case for heco 
heco also agreed it will not pursue the continuation of lost margins recovery and shareholder incentives through a surcharge mechanism in future rate cases 
in 
table of contents october  helco and meco reached similar agreements with the consumer advocate and filed requests to continue their four existing dsm programs 
in november  the puc issued orders one of which was later amended that  subject to certain reporting requirements and other conditions  approved the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of heco s five existing dsm programs until heco s next rate case and the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of helco s and meco s dsm programs until one year after the puc makes a revenue requirements determination in heco s next rate case 
under the orders  however  helco and meco are allowed to recover only lost margins and shareholder incentives accrued through the date that interim rates are established in heco s next rate case  but may request to extend the time of such accrual and recovery for up to one additional year 
in  meco s revenues from shareholder incentives were million lower than the amount that would have been recorded if meco had not agreed to cap such incentives when its authorized ror was exceeded 
also in  helco slightly exceeded its authorized ror resulting in a reduction of revenues from shareholders incentives for by  recorded in january 
in  heco did not exceed its authorized ror 
in  none of the electric utilities exceeded their respective authorized rors 
in  heco and helco did not exceed their respective authorized rors  but meco exceeded its authorized ror  resulting in a reduction of revenues from shareholders incentives and lost margins for by million recorded in december 
one of the conditions to the temporary continuation of the dsm programs requires the utilities and the consumer advocate to review  every six months  the economic and rate impacts resulting from implementing the agreement 
in reviewing helco s ror for  the consumer advocate raised an issue regarding keahole settlement expenses and helco agreed to refund  with interest  all of the lost margins and shareholder incentives it had earned in in june  helco recorded reduced revenues of million to reflect the lost margins and shareholder incentives for that were refunded to customers in august no issues were raised regarding the lost margins and shareholder incentives earned by heco or meco in in  heco and the consumer advocate reached agreement on a residential load management program and a commercial and industrial load management program and the puc approved heco s programs 
implementation of these programs began in early the residential load management program includes a monthly electric bill credit for eligible customers who participate in the program  which allows heco to disconnect the customer s residential electric water heaters from heco s system to reduce system load when deemed necessary by heco 
the commercial and industrial load management program provides an incentive on the portion of the demand load that eligible customers allow to be controlled or interrupted by heco 
in addition  if heco interrupts the load  an incentive is paid on the kilowatthours interrupted 
customer incentives for the programs are expected to be approximately million for the first full year and total million over years 
avoided cost generic docket 
in may  the puc instituted a generic investigation including all of hawaii s electric utilities to examine the proxy method and the proxy method formula used by the electric utilities to calculate their avoided energy costs and schedule q rates 
in general  schedule q rates are available to customers with cogeneration and or small power production facilities with a capacity of kilowatthours or less who buy sell power from to the electric utility 
in addition to the electric utilities  the parties to the docket include the consumer advocate  the department of defense  and representatives of existing or potential independent power producers ipps 
in march  the parties entered into and filed a stipulation to resolve proceedings  which is subject to puc approval 
the parties could not reach agreement with respect to certain of the issues  which are addressed in statements of position filed in march no further action was taken in the docket until july  at which time the puc ordered the parties to review and update  if necessary  the agreements  information and data contained in the stipulation and file such information and stated that further action will follow 
the requested information will be submitted by the end of march collective bargaining agreements each of the electric utilities entered into a new four year collective bargaining agreement in with the union which represents of electric utility employees 
see collective bargaining agreements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents legislation and regulation congress and the hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the utilities and their customers 
for example  although it is currently stalled in a house senate conference committee  comprehensive energy legislation is still before congress that could increase the domestic supply of oil as well as increase support for energy conservation programs and mandate the use of renewables by utilities 
the hawaii legislature adopted a law which required the utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard of by december  the company met this standard with over of the utilities consolidated electricity sales for from renewable resources as defined under the renewable portfolio standards rps law 
the hawaii legislature amended the rps law to require electric utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard of by december   by december   by december   and by december  the definition of renewable energy as amended in  includes not only electrical energy savings brought about by the use of solar and heat pump water heating which were already included in the definition  but also such savings brought about by seawater air conditioning district cooling systems  solar air conditioning and ice storage  quantifiable energy conservation measures  and use of rejected heat from co generation and combined heat and power systems excluding fossil fueled qualifying facilities that sell electricity to electric utility companies  and central station power projects 
heco  helco and meco are permitted to aggregate their renewable portfolios in order to achieve these standards 
the puc has to determine if an electric utility is not able to meet the standard in a cost effective manner or due to circumstances beyond its control 
if such a determination is made  the utility is relieved of its responsibility to achieve the standard for that period of time 
the puc also may provide incentives to encourage electric utility companies to exceed their rps or to meet their rps ahead of time  or both 
the law also requires participation by the state to support and facilitate achievement of the rps 
an independent  peer reviewed study will be conducted by the hawaii natural energy institute 
the study will look at the electric utilities capability of achieving the standards based on a number of factors  including impact on customer rates  utility system reliability and stability  costs and availability of appropriate renewable energy resources and technologies  permitting approvals  and impacts on the economy  culture  community and environment 
the rps law also directs the puc  by december   to develop and implement a utility ratemaking structure  which may include  but is not limited to performance based ratemaking pbr  to provide incentives that encourage hawaii s electric utility companies to use cost effective renewable energy resources found in hawaii to meet the rps  while allowing for deviation from the standards in the event that the standards cannot be met in a cost effective manner  or as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the utility which could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated 
on november   the puc transmitted an initial concept paper  entitled electric utility rate design in hawaii  describing the puc s intended methodology for fulfilling the legislative mandate  and requested comments 
as summarized in the paper  the puc has a legislative mandate to formulate an electric utility rate design  by december  that enables the achievement of rps requiring that renewable energy resources are to have a specific share in the power generation mix by a particular period of time  encourages investments in renewable energy facilities  conforms to the existing regulatory regime  which is cost of service regulation  or to alternative regulatory regimes  such as pbr  and provides utilities an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return 
the overall process envisioned by the puc is the conduct of three sets of workshops  and the creation of a document leading to rulemaking 
comments were submitted on behalf of the electric utilities  as well as other persons and organizations 
the first workshop was held in november  and involved comments by the puc s modeling consultant  economists incorporated  and many of those who submitted written comments 
according to the initial concept paper  the puc  employing a collaborative approach  plans to hold three workshops encouraging public discussion of its work in progress 
the goal of the first workshop was to describe and gather comments on the puc s methodology as a whole 
the goal of the second workshop  planned for march  is to describe and gather comments on the key factors driving successful rps schemes and pbr regimes as well as on their use as inputs to the design of electric utility rates in hawaii 
the goal of the third workshop  planned for may or june  is to describe and gather comments on the simulation of the power market in hawaii incorporating  as discussed in the prior workshops  the lessons learned on electric utility rate design under various rps schemes and pbr regimes  as well as on its use as a tool for electric utility rate design in hawaii 
the puc envisions that the end result of all the analysis will be a document that forms the basis of a set of rules to be adopted in a conventional 
table of contents rulemaking process to follow  providing input to the puc s decisions on electric utility ratemaking 
management cannot predict the outcome of this process 
the electric utilities continue to pursue a three prong renewable energy strategy a promote the development of cost effective  commercially viable renewable energy projects  b facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources  and c encourage renewable energy research  development  and demonstration projects eg  photovoltaic energy 
they are also conducting integrated resource planning to evaluate the increased use of renewables within the electric utilities service territories 
among the various ways that the electric utilities support renewable energy are solar water heating and heat pump programs and the negotiation and execution of purchased power contracts with nonutility generators using renewable sources eg  refuse fired  geothermal  hydroelectric and wind turbine generating systems 
in december  helco signed an approximate mw as available wind power contract with hawi renewable development  and the contract was approved by the puc in may in october  a contract with apollo energy corporation to repower an existing mw windfarm to mw was signed and an application for puc approval was submitted in november in december  meco signed an approximately mw as available wind power contract with kaheawa wind power  llc and submitted an application for puc approval 
in december  heco formed an unregulated subsidiary  rhi  with initial approval to invest up to million in selected renewable energy projects 
rhi is seeking to stimulate renewable energy initiatives by prospecting for new projects and sites  and taking a passive  minority interest in third party renewable energy projects 
in and  rhi solicited competitive proposals for investment opportunities in qualified projects 
to date  rhi has signed a memorandum of understanding mou and project agreement for a small scale municipal solid waste to energy project and a mou for a small scale landfill gas to energy project  both situated on oahu 
project investments by rhi will generally be made only after developers secure the necessary approvals and permits and independently execute a power purchase agreement with heco  helco or meco  approved by the puc 
hawaii has a net energy metering law  which requires that electric utilities offer net energy metering to eligible customer generators ie a customer generator may be a net user or supplier of energy and will make payment to or receive credit from the electric utility accordingly 
the legislature amended the net energy metering law by expanding the definition of eligible customer generator to include government entities  increasing the maximum size of eligible net metered systems from kilowatts kw to kw  and limiting exemptions from additional requirements for systems meeting safety and performance standards to systems of kw or less 
these amendments could have a negative effect on electric utility sales 
however  based on experience under the kw limit and assessment of market opportunity for kw applications  management does not expect any such effect to be material 
the legislature also passed legislation that clarifies that the accepting agency or authority for an environmental impact statement is not required to be the approving agency for the permit or approval and also requires an environmental assessment for proposed waste to energy facilities  landfills  oil refineries  power generating facilities greater than mw and wastewater facilities  except individual wastewater systems 
this legislation could result in an increase in project costs 
for a discussion of environmental legislation and regulations  see environmental matters below 
other developments heco has completed a small scale technical feasibility trial of the broadband over power line bpl technology in honolulu  and is now proceeding with a medium scale pilot in an expanded residential commercial area in honolulu 
the purpose of this pilot is to continue to evaluate the technical feasibility of the bpl technology and its applications in a variety of configurations and environments 
bpl enabled utility applications to be evaluated include distribution system monitoring and control  advanced remote metering  and residential direct load control 
although its evaluation will be focused primarily on utility applications of bpl  heco will also be evaluating broadband information services that might potentially be provided by other service providers 
the pilot will involve to residential subscribers in overhead  underground  and multi dwelling unit electric distribution environments 
the pilot is expected to commence in and run for approximately a year 
in october  the federal communications commission fcc released a report and order in the matter of amendment of part regarding new requirements and measurement guidelines for access broadband over 
table of contents power line systems and in the matter of carrier current systems  including broadband over power line systems 
the report and order amends and adopts new rules for access broadband over power line systems access bpl and states that the fcc s goals in developing the rules for access bpl are therefore to provide a framework that will both facilitate the rapid introduction and development of bpl systems and protect licensed radio services from harmful interference 
currently  there are no puc regulations for electric utility applications of bpl systems

the following table presents a reconciliation of asb s net income to net income excluding the million charge in and including additional bank franchise taxes in prior periods as if asb had not taken a dividends received deduction on dividends paid by its reit subsidiary 
management believes the adjusted information below presents asb s net income on a more comparable basis for the periods shown

taking into account the adjustments in the table above  asb s net income would have increased compared to 
table of contents bank operations earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
asb s loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates  competition  demand for financing  availability of funds and management s responses to these factors

other factors primarily affecting asb s operating results include gains or losses on sales of securities available for sale  fee income  provision for loan losses  changes in the value of mortgage servicing rights and expenses from operations 
low interest rates and high mortgage refinancing volume in and the first half of have put pressure on asb s interest rate spread as the loan portfolio repriced upon refinancing at lower interest rates  while at the same time deposit rates were already at low levels in the federal reserve bank s rate increases since mid have led to higher short term interest rates  while during the same period  long term interest rates have remained low or fallen  resulting in a flatter yield curve 
the higher short term interest rates have put upward pressure on deposit rates  while the low long term interest rates have held down asset yields  putting downward pressure on net interest margins 
if the flattening persists  or the yield curve becomes flatter  the potential for further compression of asb s margins will continue to be a concern 
although higher long term interest rates could reduce the market value of mortgage related securities and reduce stockholder s equity through a balance sheet charge to aoci  this reduction in the market value of mortgage related securities would not result in a charge to net income in the absence of an other than temporary impairment in the value of the securities

in march  the fhlb of seattle indicated that the strategies under consideration to improve the fhlb of seattle s long term financial position will negatively impact its earnings and retained earnings in the interim  and thus potentially limit its ability to pay dividends and accommodate stock repurchases 
in the first three quarters of  the fhlb of seattle had paid total dividends on asb s investment in fhlb of seattle stock of million

table of contents strong core deposit growth 
the increase in average loan portfolio balance was due to a strong hawaii real estate market and low interest rates 
the increase in the average investment and mortgage related securities portfolios were due to the reinvestment into short term investments of excess liquidity resulting from an inflow of deposits 
average deposit balances grew by million as asb continued to attract core deposits 
during  average core deposits increased by million offset by a decrease in the average balance of term certificates of million 
the shift in deposit mix lowered the weighted average rate on deposits 
the higher deposit balances enabled asb to repay some of its maturing  higher costing other borrowings 
due to considerable strength in real estate and business conditions  which resulted in lower historical loss ratios and lower net charge offs for asb  and other factors discussed above  asb recorded a negative provision for loan losses of million million  net of tax in this compares with a provision for loan losses of million million  net of tax in other income for decreased by million  or  when compared to due to million of gains on sale of securities in  partially offset by higher fee income in general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  over  primarily due to costs associated with sarbanes oxley act of sox compliance efforts 
on january   asb became aware that the methodology it was using to amortize premiums and discounts on its mortgage related securities portfolio was not in strict conformance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
specifically  asb determined that its method for estimating the cumulative impact of revised effective yield following the provisions of paragraph of sfas no 
when considering prepayments no longer approximated the results from a strict application of these provisions 
this resulted in over amortization of net premiums 
accordingly  asb recalculated the amortization of premiums and discounts on its december  mortgage related securities portfolio in strict accordance with sfas no 
and recognized million in additional net income million pre tax interest income in the fourth quarter of for an adjustment for net premium overamortization 
net interest income before provision for loan losses for decreased by million  or  when compared to margin compression throughout most of lowered net interest spread from for to in as the low interest rate environment and significant refinancing activity in the mortgage and mortgage related securities portfolios lowered the yield on earning assets 
these lower yields coupled with an inability to lower the interest rates paid on deposits to a commensurate degree reduced the interest rate spread 
the average loan portfolio balance increased by million as the very low interest rate environment and continued strength in the hawaii real estate market spurred record loan production 
asb s average residential mortgage portfolio as of year end grew by million  or  over year end 
asb increased its average business portfolio by million  or  during as its transformation to a full service community bank continued 
average deposit balances grew by million as asb continued to attract core deposits 
during  average core deposit balances increased by million offset by a decrease in the average balance of term certificates of million 
the shift in deposit mix lowered the weighted average rate on deposits 
in response to pressure on interest rate spreads as a result of the low interest rate environment  asb restructured a total of million of fhlb advances during the restructurings involved paying off existing  higher rate fhlb advances with advances that have lower rates and longer maturities 
the restructurings resulted in a reduction of interest expense on these fhlb advances of approximately million for asb s provision for loan losses of million in decreased by million compared to as delinquencies continued to decline 
a strong hawaii real estate market and low interest rates gave debtors the opportunity to sell their properties or refinance before defaulting on loans 
in addition  asb improved its collections efforts 
these factors contributed to the lower delinquency levels during residential  consumer and commercial real estate loan delinquencies have decreased during the year and lower loan loss reserves were required for those lines of business 
the growth of the business loan portfolio has required additional loan loss reserves on those loans 
other income for increased by million  or  over  principally as a result of net gains on sales of securities totaling million compared to a net loss of million in  higher fee income from its debit and automated teller machine atm cards resulting from asb s expansion of its debit card base and additional atm

legislation and regulation congress is considering legislation to revamp oversight of government sponsored enterprises gses 
the bill would abolish the office of federal housing enterprise oversight regulator of fannie mae and freddie mac and the federal housing finance board regulator of the fhlb  create a new regulatory agency to oversee gses  and invest in this new agency the authority  among other things  to place limitations on non mission assets  to establish prudent management and operation standards for gses concerning matters such as the management of asset and investment portfolio growth  to impose prompt corrective action measures on a gse in the event of under capitalization  and to exercise oversight enforcement powers 
by possibly restricting gse asset growth  if enacted  the bill could potentially limit the availability of advances from the fhlb of seattle to asb and sale of loans to fannie mae 
asb believes  however  that if this bill is adopted and implemented in these ways  its results will not be materially adversely affected because asb has access to other funding sources and secondary markets to sell its loans 
asb is subject to extensive regulation  principally by the office of thrift supervision ots and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
depending on its level of regulatory capital and other considerations  these regulations could restrict the ability of asb to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholders

certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to differ materially from historical results 
the following is a discussion of certain of these factors 
consolidated economic conditions 
because its core businesses are providing local electric utility and banking services  hei s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy  which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland us particularly california and asia particularly japan as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism 
see economic conditions above 
competition 
the electric utility and banking industries are competitive and the company s success in meeting competition will continue to have a direct impact on the company s financial performance 
electric utility 
although competition in the generation sector in hawaii has been moderated by the scarcity of generation sites  various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities  heco and its subsidiaries face competition from ipps and customer self generation  with or without cogeneration 
in  the puc issued an order instituting a proceeding to identify and examine the issues surrounding electric competition and to determine the impact of competition on the electric utility infrastructure in hawaii 
in october  the puc closed the competition proceeding and opened investigative dockets on two specific issues 
table of contents competitive bidding and distributed generation dg to move toward a more competitive electric industry environment under cost based regulation 
competitive bidding proceeding 
the stated purpose of the competitive bidding proceeding is to evaluate competitive bidding as a mechanism for acquiring or building new generating capacity in hawaii 
the puc stated it would consider related filings on a case by case basis pending completion of the competitive bidding and dg dockets 
the current parties participants in the competitive bidding proceeding include the consumer advocate  heco  helco  meco  kauai island utility cooperative  the gas company  the counties of maui and kauai  a renewable energy organization and vendors of dg equipment and services 
in april  the parties and participants entered into and filed a proposed stipulated prehearing order  and the puc adopted the issues and procedures proposed for consideration in the stipulated order and the proposed schedule with modifications 
the issues to be addressed in the proceeding include the benefits and impacts of competitive bidding  whether a competitive bidding system should be developed for acquiring or building new generation  and revisions that should be made to integrated resource planning 
if competitive bidding is adopted  the proceeding will address specific bidding guidelines and requirements that encourage broad participation but do not place ratepayers at undue risk 
the procedural schedule has been modified and includes statements of position by all parties in march and evidentiary hearings in a panel format in october management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or its effect on the ability of the electric utilities to acquire or build additional generating capacity in the future 
distributed generation proceeding 
historically  heco and its subsidiaries have been able to compete by offering customers economic alternatives that  among other things  employ energy efficient electrotechnologies such as the heat pump water heater 
however  the number of customer self generation projects that are being proposed or installed in hawaii  particularly those involving combined heat and power chp systems  is growing 
chp systems are a form of dg  and produce electricity and thermal energy from gas  propane or diesel fired engines 
in hawaii  the thermal energy generally is used to heat water and  through an absorption chiller  drive an air conditioning system 
the electric energy generated by these systems is usually lower in output than the customer s load  which results in continued connection to the utility grid to make up the difference in electricity demand and to provide back up electricity 
the electric utilities initiated a small chp demonstration project on maui in as part of an on going evaluation of dg 
the electric utilities also have made proposals to customers  subject to puc review and approval  to install and operate utility owned chp systems at the customers sites 
the electric utilities have executed a number of letters of intent and one memorandum of understanding to conduct preliminary engineering for potential chp projects 
the electric utilities also signed agreements in with two customers to install  operate and maintain utility owned chp systems  subject to puc review and approval 
incremental generation from such customer sited chp systems  and other dg  is expected to complement traditional central station power  as part of the electric utilities plans to serve their forecast load growth 
in july  three vendors of dg chp equipment and services proposed  in an informal complaint to the puc  that the puc open a proceeding to investigate the electric utilities provision of chp services and their teaming agreement with another vendor  and to issue rules or orders to govern the terms and conditions under which the electric utilities will be permitted to engage in utility owned dg at individual customers sites 
in august  the electric utilities responded to the informal complaint  and to information requests from the puc on the chp demonstration project and a teaming agreement 
in october  the puc opened an investigative docket to determine the potential benefits and impact of dg on hawaii s electric distribution systems and markets and to develop policies and a framework for dg projects deployed in hawaii 
the parties and participants to the proceeding include the consumer advocate  heco  helco  meco  kauai island utility cooperative  the counties of maui and kauai  a renewable energy organization  a vendor of dg equipment and services and an environmental organization 
in april  the puc issued an order in the proceeding  based in large part on a stipulated order proposed by the parties and participants that includes planning  impact and implementation issues 
the planning issues address forms of dg eg  renewable energy facilities  hybrid renewable energy systems  generation  cogeneration that may be feasible and viable for hawaii  who should own and operate dg projects  and the role of regulated electric utility companies and the puc in 
table of contents the deployment of dg in hawaii 
the impact issues address the impacts  if any  dg will have on hawaii s electric transmission and distribution systems and market  the impacts of dg on power quality and reliability  utility costs that can be avoided by dg  external impact costs and benefits of dg  and the potential for dg to reduce the use of fossil fuels 
implementation issues include matters to be considered to allow a dg facility to interconnect with the electric utility s grid  appropriate rate design and cost allocation issues that must be considered with the deployment of dg facilities  revisions that should be made to the integrated resource planning process  and revisions that should be made to puc rules and utility rules and practices to facilitate the successful deployment of dg 
the parties and participants can also address issues raised in the informal complaint  but not specific claims made against any of the parties named in the complaint 
hearings were held in december as a result of the docket on dg  the electric utilities cancelled its teaming agreement for chp systems with ratings up to mw  and issued a request for qualifications as part of a new equipment procurement process for all chp systems 
management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding 
in october  the electric utilities filed an application for approval of a chp tariff  under which they would provide chp services to eligible commercial customers 
under the tariff  the electric utilities would own  operate and maintain customer sited  packaged chp systems and certain ancillary equipment pursuant to a standard form of contract with the customer 
in march  the puc issued an order in which it suspended the chp tariff application until  at a minimum  the matters in the investigative docket on dg have been addressed 
pending approval of a chp tariff  the electric utilities requested approval of its two agreements for chp projects 
in january  the puc issued an order suspending the applications for approval of the projects until  at a minimum  the matters in the investigative dg docket have been adequately addressed  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of one of the agreements was subsequently terminated and the application for approval of the project was withdrawn 
bank 
the banking industry in hawaii is highly competitive 
asb is the third largest financial institution in hawaii  based on assets  and is in direct competition for deposits and loans  not only with the two larger institutions  but also with smaller institutions that are heavily promoting their services in certain niche areas  such as providing financial services to small and medium sized businesses  and national organizations offering financial services 
asb s main competitors are banks  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage brokers  finance companies and securities brokerage firms 
these competitors offer a variety of lending  deposit and investment products to retail and business customers 
the primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates  the quality and range of services offered  marketing  convenience of locations  hours of operation and perceptions of the institution s financial soundness and safety 
to meet competition  asb offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates  convenient business hours  convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch and convenient automated teller machines 
asb also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns 
the primary factors in competing for first mortgage and other loans are interest rates  loan origination fees and the quality and range of lending and other services offered 
asb believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges  the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community 
asb has been expanding its traditional consumer focus to be a full service community bank and has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single family home mortgages to higher yielding  shorter duration consumer  business and commercial real estate loans 
the origination of consumer  business and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans 
for example  the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for mortgage loans 
these different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for loan losses established by asb for its consumer  business and commercial real estate loans 
in recent years  there has been significant bank and thrift merger activity affecting hawaii  including the merger in of the holding companies for the state s th and th largest financial institutions based on assets 
management cannot predict the impact  if any  of these mergers on the company s future competitive position  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents us capital markets and interest rate environment 
changes in the us capital markets can have significant effects on the company 
for example the company estimates that consolidated retirement benefits expense  net of amounts capitalized and income taxes  will be million in as compared to million in  partly as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on the discount rate used to determine retirement benefit liabilities 
volatility in us capital markets may negatively impact the fair values of investment and mortgage related securities held by asb 
as of december   the fair value and carrying value of the investment and mortgage related securities held by asb were billion 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
asb actively manages this risk  including managing the relationship of its interest sensitive assets to its interest sensitive liabilities 
federal government monetary policies and low interest rates have resulted in high mortgage refinancing volume in and as well as accelerated prepayments of loans and securities 
asb s interest rate spread  the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of funds  has been experiencing compression since the fourth quarter of as the yields on assets declined more rapidly than the cost of funds 
the federal reserve began increasing rates in  causing the cost of funds to rise while yields on mortgage assets remained low 
as of december   the company had no floating rate long term debt outstanding 
as of december   heco had issued million of commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of and maturities ranging from to days 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  the commercial development of fuel cells or distributed generation or significant advances in internet banking may impact the company s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
discontinued operations and asset dispositions 
the company discontinued its international power operations in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
problems may be encountered or liabilities may arise in the exit from these operations 
for example  in accounting for the discontinuance of operations under accounting standards at the time of discontinuation  estimates were made by management concerning the income tax benefits to be realized upon the disposition of those operations and concerning the costs and liabilities that would be incurred in connection with the discontinuation 
management made these estimates based on the information available  but the amounts finally realized on disposition of the discontinued operations  and the amount of the liabilities and costs ultimately incurred in connection with those operations  may differ materially from the recorded amounts 
at december   the net assets of the discontinued international power operations amounted to million  consisting primarily of tax benefits receivable  partly offset by a reserve for future expenses 
in addition  in connection with prior dispositions of operations  additional unrecorded liabilities may arise if claims are asserted under indemnities provided in connection with the dispositions 
it is also possible that the company may recover amounts relating to claims arising in connection with discontinued operations 
for example  heipc and its subsidiaries are continuing to pursue recovery of a significant portion of its losses related to a joint venture interest in a china project through arbitration of its claims under a political risk insurance policy 
pursuit of such recoveries  however  may be costly and there can be no assurance that the pursuit of any claims will be successful or that any amounts will be recovered 
limited insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  the company purchases insurance coverages eg  property and liability coverages to protect itself against loss of or damage to its properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries 
however  the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and  in some instances  the company has no coverage 
for example  the electric utilities overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems with the exception of substation buildings and contents have a replacement value roughly estimated at billion and are uninsured because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive 
similarly  the electric utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive  particularly since the utilities are not interconnected to other systems 
asb also has no insurance coverage for business interruption nor credit card fraud 
if a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster should occur  and the puc does not allow the company to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and 
table of contents revenues lost from business interruption  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
also  certain of the company s insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered 
insurers also have exclusions or limitations of coverage for claims related to certain perils including  but not limited to  mold and terrorism 
if a series of losses occurred  such as from a series of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business each of which were subject to the deductible amount  or if the maximum limit of the available insurance were substantially exceeded  the company could incur losses in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
hei and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities  the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances 
these laws and regulations  among other things  require that certain environmental permits be obtained as a condition to constructing or operating certain facilities  and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays 
also  these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance 
management believes that the recovery through rates of most  if not all  of any costs incurred by heco and its subsidiaries in complying with environmental requirements would be allowed by the puc 
the heco  helco and meco generating stations operate under air pollution control permits issued by the doh and  in a limited number of cases  by the epa 
the entire electric utility industry has been affected by the amendments to the clean air act caa  changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone  and adoption of a naaqs for fine particulate matter 
further significant impacts may occur if currently proposed legislation  rules and standards are adopted 
if the clear skies bill is adopted as currently proposed  heco  and to a lesser extent  helco and meco will likely incur significant capital and operations and maintenance costs beginning one to two years after enactment 
in addition  heco boilers may be affected by the air toxics provisions title iii of the caa when the maximum allowable control technology mact emission standards are established for those units 
heco believes that  if adopted as currently proposed  the recent epa proposal to regulate nickel emissions from oil fired boilers may result in significant capital investments and operations and maintenance costs for heco s steam generating units within the three year period after adoption 
the epa has announced that the final rule will be promulgated by march  although it is unclear at this time whether the nickel control requirements will remain in the final rule 
heco has not yet budgeted for such costs in its five year capital expenditures forecast 
the utility industry is also subject to the federal clean water act 
section b of the clean water act requires that the epa ensure that existing power plant cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
effective september   the epa issued a new rule  which the epa estimates affects approximately facilities across the nation 
the rule establishes location  design  construction and capacity standards for existing cooling water intake structures that apply to heco s kahe  waiau and honolulu generating stations 
strong technology based performance standards apply unless a facility shows that these standards will result in very high costs or little environmental benefit at the facility site 
heco has until march to demonstrate compliance 
heco has retained a consultant to develop a cost effective compliance strategy and a preliminary assessment of technologies and operational measures 
although heco believes that it will be able to cost effectively achieve compliance  if studies show that it cannot develop and implement a compliance strategy short of reconstruction of the affected cooling water intake structures  the capital costs would be significant 
heco has not yet budgeted for such costs in its five year capital expenditures forecast 
heco and its subsidiaries  like other utilities  periodically identify leaking petroleum containing equipment such as underground storage tanks  piping and transformers 
the electric utilities report releases from such equipment when and as required by applicable law and address impacts due to the releases in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
the honolulu harbor environmental investigation  described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  is an ongoing environmental investigation 
although this investigation is expected to entail significant expense over the next several years  management does not believe  based on information available to the company at this time  that the costs of this investigation or any other contingent liabilities relating to environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  there can be no assurance that a significant 
table of contents environmental liability will not be incurred by the electric utilities  including with respect to the honolulu harbor environmental investigation 
prior to extending a loan secured by real property  asb conducts due diligence to assess whether or not the property may present environmental risks and potential cleanup liability 
in the event of default and foreclosure of a loan  asb may become the owner of the mortgaged property 
for that reason  asb seeks to avoid lending upon the security of  or acquiring through foreclosure  any property with significant potential environmental risks  however  there can be no assurance that asb will successfully avoid all such environmental risks 
electric utility regulation of electric utility rates 
the puc has broad discretion in its regulation of the rates charged by hei s electric utilities and in other matters 
any adverse d o by the puc concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates  the authorized returns on equity or other matters  or any prolonged delay in rendering a d o in a rate or other proceeding  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
upon a showing of probable entitlement  the puc is required to issue an interim d o in a rate case within months from the date of filing a completed application if the evidentiary hearing is completed subject to extension for days if the evidentiary hearing is not completed 
there is no time limit for rendering a final d o 
interim rate increases are subject to refund with interest  pending the final outcome of the case 
through december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of revenues including interest and revenue taxes with respect to interim orders regarding certain integrated resource planning costs  which revenues are subject to refund  with interest  to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders 
the consumer advocate has objected to the recovery of million before interest of the million of incremental integrated resource planning costs incurred during through  and the puc s decision is pending on this matter 
in addition  heco and meco incurred approximately million of incremental integrated resource planning costs for  as to which the consumer advocate has not yet stated its position 
management cannot predict with certainty when d os in future rate cases will be rendered or the amount of any interim or final rate increase that may be granted 
the rate schedules of the electric utilities include energy cost adjustment clauses under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
in puc decisions approving the electric utilities fuel supply contracts  the puc noted that  in light of the length of the fuel supply contracts and the relative stability of fuel prices  the need for continued use of energy cost adjustment clauses would be the subject of investigation in a generic docket or in a future rate case 
these clauses were continued in the most recent helco and meco rate cases final d o s issued in february and april  respectively 
the electric utilities reached agreement with their suppliers on amendments to their existing fuel supply contracts that extend the contracts through december on substantially the same terms and conditions  including market related pricing 
in december  the puc approved the amendments to the fuel supply contracts 
in approving the amendments  the puc indicated questions still remain concerning the energy cost adjustment clauses and their continued use to recover fuel contract costs  and indicated that  consistent with its prior decisions  it plans to examine the continued use of the energy cost adjustment clauses to recover the various costs incurred pursuant to the amended fuel contracts in heco s pending rate case  and in helco s and meco s next respective rate cases 
until such time  the electric utilities will continue to recover their fuel contract costs through their respective energy cost adjustment clauses to the extent the costs are not recovered in their base rates 
if the energy cost adjustment clauses were discontinued  the electric utilities results of operations could fluctuate significantly as a result of increases and decreases in fuel oil and purchased energy prices 
consultants periodically conduct depreciation studies for the electric utilities to determine whether the existing approved rates and methods used to calculate depreciation accruals are appropriate for the production  transmission  distribution and general plant accounts 
if it is determined that the existing rates and methods are no longer appropriate  changes to those rates are recommended as part of the study 
in october  heco filed an application with the puc for approval to change its depreciation rates and to change to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts 
see most recent rate requests above 

table of contents in may  the puc issued a d o authorizing an increase from million to million  effective july   in the threshold for capital improvement projects requiring advance puc review 
this increase generally reflects the cumulative effects of inflation since the review requirement was originally established in fuel oil and purchased power 
the electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and ipps to deliver fuel oil and power  respectively 
see fuel contracts and power purchase agreements ppas in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company estimates that of the net energy generated and purchased by heco and its subsidiaries in will be generated from the burning of oil 
purchased kwhs provided approximately of the total net energy generated and purchased in compared to in and in failure by the electric utilities oil suppliers to provide fuel pursuant to existing supply contracts  or failure by a major independent power producer to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its power purchase agreement  could interrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
heco s policy  however  is to maintain an inventory of fuel oil equivalent to a day supply 
helco s and meco s policies are to maintain approximately a one month s supply of both medium sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel 
the electric utilities major sources of oil  through their suppliers  are in alaska  indonesia and the far east 
some  but not all  of the electric utilities power purchase agreements require that the ipps maintain minimum fuel inventory levels and all of the firm capacity power purchase agreements include provisions imposing substantial penalties for failure to produce the firm capacity anticipated by those agreements 
other operation and maintenance expenses 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased  and for  and  respectively  when compared to the prior year 
this trend of increased operation and maintenance expenses is expected to continue in as the electric utilities anticipate higher demand side management and integrated resource planning expenses that are passed on to customers through a surcharge and therefore do not impact net income  higher employee benefits expenses  primarily for retirement benefits  higher production expenses  primarily to meet higher demand and load growth  and higher expenses for new technologies  including broadband over power lines and renewable power sources 
the timing and amount of these expenses can vary as circumstances change 
for example  recent overhauls have been more expensive than in the past due to the larger scope of work necessary to maintain the equipment and expenses for technologies may change as emerging technologies prove or disprove themselves 
in october  one of heco s two combustion turbines cts on oahu experienced a sudden and accidental breakage of a blade that subsequently caused a catastrophic failure of the entire turbine 
greater customer demand resulting in higher usage of the ct contributed to the failure 
while partially covered by insurance  the repair costs are significant additional expenses necessary for service reliability 
heco plans to complete this overhaul during the first half of heco will then begin preventive overhaul work on its other ct  which has been also used to meet increased customer demand for extended periods 
although it will not be known until the overhaul is fully underway  it is possible that the maintenance costs for this unit will be higher than originally planned 
increased other operation and maintenance expenses is one of the reasons heco filed a request with the puc in november to increase base rates 
other regulatory and permitting contingencies 
many public utility projects require puc approval and various permits eg  environmental and land use permits from other agencies 
delays in obtaining puc approval or permits can result in increased costs 
if a project does not proceed or if the puc disallows costs of the project  the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
two major capital improvement utility projects  the keahole project and the east oahu transmission project  have encountered opposition and the keahole project has been seriously delayed although full time operation of ct and ct at keahole is now expected in the second quarter of 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents bank regulation of asb 
asb is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the ots and the fdic  and is subject to reserve requirements established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
by reason of the regulation of its subsidiary  asb realty corporation  asb is also subject to regulation by the hawaii commissioner of financial institutions 
regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of asb s capital and the results of periodic safety and soundness examinations conducted by the ots 
asb s insurance product sales activities  including those conducted by asb s insurance agency subsidiary  bishop insurance agency of hawaii  inc  are subject to regulation by the hawaii insurance commissioner 
capital requirements 
the ots  which is asb s principal regulator  administers two sets of capital standards minimum regulatory capital requirements and prompt corrective action requirements 
the fdic also has prompt corrective action capital requirements 
as of december   asb was in compliance with ots minimum regulatory capital requirements and was well capitalized within the meaning of ots prompt corrective action regulations and fdic capital regulations  as follows asb met applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements noted in parentheses at december  with a tangible capital ratio of  a core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
asb met the capital requirements to be generally considered well capitalized noted in parentheses at december  with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
the purpose of the prompt corrective action capital requirements is to establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators 
declines in levels of capital  depending on their severity  will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences 
capital levels may decline for any number of reasons  including reductions that would result if there were losses from operations  deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned such as by foreclosure 
the regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that asb may make to its shareholders and the requirement that asb develop and implement a plan to restore its capital 
under an agreement with regulators entered into by hei when it acquired asb  hei could be required to contribute to asb up to an additional million of capital  if necessary to maintain asb s capital position 
examinations 
asb is subject to periodic safety and soundness examinations and other examinations by the ots 
in conducting its examinations  the ots utilizes the uniform financial institutions rating system adopted by the federal financial institutions examination council  which system utilizes the camels criteria for rating financial institutions 
the six components in the rating system are capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk 
the ots examines and rates each camels component 
an overall camels rating is also given  after taking into account all of the component ratings 
a financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order following an examination if its camels rating is not satisfactory 
an institution is prohibited from disclosing the ots s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall camels rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer  director  employee  attorney  or auditor  except as provided by regulation 
the ots also regularly examines asb s information technology practices  and its performance as related to the community reinvestment act measurement criteria 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended  addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards 
pursuant to this act  federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of asb and its holding companies eg  standards for safety and soundness  real estate lending  accounting and reporting  transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that fail to meet relevant capital measures to engage in certain activities  such as offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions and offering pass through insurance coverage ie  insurance coverage 
table of contents that passes through to each owner beneficiary of the applicable deposit for the deposits of most employee benefit plans ie   per individual participant  not  per plan 
as of december   asb was well capitalized and thus not subject to these restrictions 
qualified thrift lender status 
asb is a qualified thrift lender qtl under its federal thrift charter and  in order to maintain this status  asb is required to maintain at least of its assets in qualified thrift investments  which include housing related loans including mortgage related securities as well as certain small business loans  education loans  loans made through credit card accounts and a basket not exceeding of total assets of other consumer loans and other assets 
savings associations that fail to maintain qtl status are subject to various penalties  including limitations on their activities 
in asb s case  the activities of hei  heidi and hei s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions  and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of asb 
as of december   approximately of its assets were qualified thrift investments 
federal thrift charter 
in november  congress passed the gramm leach bliley act of the gramm act  under which banks  insurance companies and investment firms can compete directly against each other  thereby allowing one stop shopping for an array of financial services 
although the gramm act further restricts the creation of so called unitary savings and loan holding companies ie  companies such as hei whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries  the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among hei  heidi and asb is grandfathered under the gramm act so that hei and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as asb maintains its qtl status 
under the gramm act  any proposed sale of asb would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of asb would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as  or capable of qualifying as  either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company  or as one of the newly authorized financial holding companies permitted under the gramm act 
material estimates and critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the case of the company include the amounts reported for investment securities  property  plant and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  contingencies and litigation  income taxes  regulatory assets and liabilities  electric utility revenues  vies  allowance for loan losses  and reserves for discontinued operations 
management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it requires assumption s to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumption s selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
for example  in  a significant change in estimated income taxes occurred as a result of a tax appeal court decision see asb state franchise tax dispute and settlement in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management has identified the following accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the company s financial statements that is  management believes that the policies below are both the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and currently require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the hei audit committee 
for additional discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated investment securities 
debt securities that the company intends to and has the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost 
marketable equity securities and debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
marketable 
table of contents equity securities and debt securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
for securities that are not trading securities  declines in value determined to be other than temporary are included in earnings and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
the specific identification method is used in determining realized gains and losses on the sales of securities 
asb owns one investment security  private issue mortgage related securities and mortgage related securities issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  government national mortgage association gnma and federal national mortgage association fnma  all of which are classified as available for sale 
market prices for the investment security and mortgage related securities issued by fhlmc  gnma  and fnma are available from most third party securities pricing services and asb obtains market prices for these securities from a third party financial services provider 
market prices for the private issue mortgage related securities are not readily available from standard pricing services  so prices are obtained from dealers who are specialists in those markets 
the prices of these securities may be influenced by factors such as market liquidity  corporate credit considerations of the underlying collateral  levels of interest rates  expectations of prepayments and defaults  limited investor base  market sector concerns and overall market psychology 
adverse changes in any of these factors may result in additional losses 
at december   asb had mortgage related securities issued by fhlmc  gnma and fnma valued at billion and private issue mortgage related securities valued at billion 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost 
self constructed electric utility plant includes engineering  supervision  and administrative and general costs  and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the construction period 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to property  plant and equipment when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes 
upon the retirement or sale of electric utility plant  no gain or loss is recognized 
the cost of the plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation 
amounts collected from customers for cost of removal expected to exceed salvage value in the future are included in regulatory liabilities 
management believes that the puc will allow recovery of property  plant and equipment in its electric rates 
if the puc does not allow recovery of any such costs  the electric utility would be required to write off the disallowed costs at that time 
see the discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements concerning costs recorded for ct and ct at keahole and the east oahu transmission project 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations 
pension and other postretirement benefit collectively  retirement benefits costs returns are charged credited primarily to expense and electric utility plant 
the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions to the plans and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future costs 
no changes were made to the retirement benefit plans provisions in  and that have had a significant impact on recorded retirement benefit plan amounts 
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used 
as a result of the factors listed above  significant portions of retirement benefits costs recorded in any period do not reflect the actual benefits provided to plan participants 
for and  the company recorded other postretirement benefit expense  net of amounts capitalized  of approximately million and million  respectively  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
actual payments of such benefits and plan expenses made during and were million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
for and  the company recorded pension expense  net of amounts capitalized  of approximately million and million  respectively  and paid pension benefits and plan expenses of million and million  respectively 

table of contents the assumptions used by management in making benefit and funding calculations are based on current economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions will impact the underlying assumptions in determining retirement benefits costs on a prospective basis 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  the company benchmarks its discount rate assumption to the moody s daily long term corporate bond aa yield average which was at december  compared to at december  and changes in this rate from period to period 
in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  the company considers economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans  the plans asset allocations and the past performance of the plans assets 
as presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has revised its discount rate as of december  compared to december  the change did not have an impact on reported costs in  however  for future years  this change will have a significant impact 
based upon the revised discount rate decreased basis points to and the plans assets as of december   the company estimates that retirement benefits expense  net of amounts capitalized and income taxes  will be million in as compared to million in of the million of net retirement benefits expense  it is projected that heco and its subsidiaries will record an estimated million in as compared to million in in determining the retirement benefits costs  assumptions can change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to these estimated amounts 
the company s plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased retirement benefits costs and contributions in future periods

contingencies and litigation 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to environmental matters 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue often with the assistance of outside counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future 
table of contents due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters  such as a change in settlement strategy 
in general  environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense  unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered in future rates  in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets 
also  environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of property  the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale 
see environmental regulation in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the honolulu harbor investigation 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management periodically evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from tax experts 
management believes that the company s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the company s current and deferred income tax amounts 
reserves for discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations and asset dispositions above 
electric utility regulatory assets and liabilities 
the electric utilities are regulated by the puc 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the company s financial statements reflect assets  liabilities  revenues and costs of heco and its subsidiaries based on current cost based rate making regulations 
the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
as of december  and  regulatory liabilities  net of regulatory assets  amounted to million and million  respectively 
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are itemized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment 
because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return  management believes the regulatory assets as of december  are probable of recovery 
this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii  and is subject to change in the future 
management believes heco and its subsidiaries operations currently satisfy the sfas no 
criteria 
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied  the electric utilities expect that the regulatory liabilities  net of regulatory assets  would be credited to income 
in the event of unforeseen regulatory actions or other circumstances  however  management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position may result if regulatory assets have to be charged to expense without an offsetting credit for regulatory liabilities 
electric utility revenues 
electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to customers 
at december   revenues applicable to energy consumed  but not yet billed to customers  amounted to million 
revenue amounts recorded pursuant to a puc interim order are subject to refund  with interest  pending a final order 
also  the rate schedules of the electric utilities include energy cost adjustment clauses under which electric 
table of contents rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
see regulation of electric utility rates above 
consolidation of vies 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised fin no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the company is evaluating the impact of applying fin r to its relationships with ipps with whom the electric utilities execute new power purchase agreements or execute amendments of existing power purchase agreements 
a possible outcome of the analysis is that heco or its subsidiaries  as applicable may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a vie the ipp which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipp in heco s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of ipps could have a material effect on heco s consolidated financial statements  including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities  and  if such a consolidated ipp were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity  the potential recognition of such losses 
the consolidation of ipps could also have a material effect on heco s credit ratings  and the electric utilities do not know how the consolidation of ipps would be treated for regulatory purposes 
bank allowance for loan losses 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   asb s allowance for loan losses was million and asb had million of loans on nonaccrual status 
in  asb s reversal of provision for loan losses was million 
although management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate  the actual loan losses  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be materially different if conditions change eg  if there is a significant change in the hawaii economy

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hei the company manages various market risks in the ordinary course of business  including credit risk and liquidity risk 
the company believes the electric utility and other segments exposures to these risks are not material as of december  credit risk for asb is the risk that borrowers or issuers of securities will not be able to repay their obligations to the bank 
credit risk associated with the lending portfolios is controlled through asb s underwriting standards  loan rating of business and commercial real estate loans  on going monitoring by loan officers  credit review and quality control functions in the lending areas and adequate allowance for loan losses 
credit risk associated with the securities portfolio is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  experienced staff working with analytical tools  monthly fair value analysis and on going monitoring and reporting such as investment watch reports and loss sensitivity analysis 
see allowance for loan losses above 
liquidity risk for asb is the risk that the bank will not meet its obligations when they become due 
liquidity risk is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  on going analytical analysis  monitoring and reporting information such as weekly cash flow analyses and maintenance of liquidity contingency plans 
the company is exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to its fuel supply and ipp contracts 
the company s commodity price risk is mitigated by the electric utilities energy cost adjustment clauses in their rate schedules 
the company currently has no hedges against its commodity price risk 
because the company does not have a portfolio of trading assets  the company is not exposed to market risk from trading activities 
the company s current exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material 
the company considers interest rate risk to be a very significant market risk as it could potentially have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  especially as it relates to asb  but also as it may affect the discount rate used to determine pension liabilities  the market value of pension plans assets and the electric utilities allowed rates of return 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s earnings to adverse movements in interest rates 
bank the company s success is dependent  in part  upon asb s ability to manage interest rate risk 
for asb  interest rate risk is the change in net interest income nii and change in market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates 
the primary source of interest rate risk is the mismatch in timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
large mismatches could adversely affect asb s earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of significant changes in the level of interest rates 
asb s asset liability management committee alco  whose voting members are officers and employees of asb  is responsible for managing interest rate risk and carrying out the overall asset liability management objectives and activities of asb as approved by the asb board of directors 
alco establishes policies under which management monitors and coordinates asb s assets and liabilities 
asb s interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits 
the fixed rate residential mortgage loans originated and retained by asb are characterized by fixed interest rates and long average lives  but also have the potential to prepay at any time without penalty 
the option to prepay is usually exercised by borrowers in low interest rate environments  significantly shortening the average lives of these assets 
the majority of asb s liabilities consist of retail deposits 
the interest rates paid on many of the retail deposit accounts can be adjusted in response to changes in market interest rates 
other retail deposit accounts with fixed interest rates typically have stated maturities much shorter than that of a year mortgage 
as a result  these liabilities will tend to reprice more frequently than the fixed rate mortgage assets 
the typical result of this combination of assets and liabilities is to create a liability sensitive interest rate risk profile 
in a rising interest rate environment  the average rate on asb s liabilities will tend to increase faster than the average rate on the assets  causing a reduction in interest rate spread and nii 
in a falling interest rate environment  the opposite happens the average rate on asb s liabilities will tend to decrease faster than the 
table of contents average rate on asb s assets  causing an increase in interest rate spread and nii 
this volatility in interest rate spread and nii represents one measure of interest rate risk 
the degree of volatility is dependent on the magnitude of the mismatch in the amount and timing of maturing or repricing interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
since asb s primary business of making fixed rate residential real estate loans and taking in retail deposits does not always result in the optimum mix of assets and liabilities for the management of nii and interest rate risk  other tools must be employed to manage interest rate risk 
chief among these is use of the investment portfolio to secure asset types that may not be available in significant amounts through loan originations  such as adjustable rate mortgage related securities  floating libor based securities  balloon or year mortgage related securities  and short average life collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
on the liability side  a shortage of retail deposits in desired maturities would typically be addressed through fhlb advances and other borrowings to meet asset liability management needs 
use of investments  fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  while efficient in managing interest rate risk  are not as profitable as asb s own lending and deposit taking activities 
in this regard  asb continues to build its portfolio of consumer  business and commercial real estate loans  which generally earn higher rates of interest and have maturities shorter than residential real estate loans 
however  the origination of consumer  business and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans 
for example  credit risk associated with consumer  business and commercial real estate loans is generally higher than for mortgage loans  the sources and level of competition for such loans differ from residential real estate lending and the making of business and commercial real estate loans is a relatively new business for asb 
these different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards established by asb for its consumer  business and commercial real estate loans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use of rate lock commitments on loans held for sale and forward sale contracts to manage some interest rate risk associated with asb s residential loan sale program 
management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis with an emphasis on measuring changes in nii and the market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments 
the simulation analysis is performed using a dedicated asset liability management software system enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a cmo database 
the simulation software is capable of generating scenario specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions 
nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pre tax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios 
nii sensitivity is measured as the change in nii in alternative interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case nii 
the base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months 
the alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate and sustained parallel shocks of the yield curve in increments of basis points 
the simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the nii is calculated for each scenario 
key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis include the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet 
in addition  assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage related assets and the pricing characteristics of new assets and liabilities 
asb s net portfolio value npv ratio is a measure of the economic capitalization of asb 
the npv ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value of asb to the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets 
net portfolio value represents the theoretical market value of asb s net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio is calculated by asb pursuant to guidelines established by the ots in thrift bulletin a 
key assumptions used in the calculation of asb s npv ratio include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments  the possible distribution of future interest rates  future pricing spreads for assets and liabilities and the rate and balance behavior of deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities 
typically  if the value of asb s assets grows relative to the value 
table of contents of its liabilities  the npv ratio will increase 
conversely  if the value of asb s liabilities grows relative to the value of its assets  the npv ratio will decrease 
the npv ratio is calculated in multiple scenarios 
as with the nii simulation  the base case is represented by the current yield curve 
alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of basis points 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is the change from the npv ratio calculated in the base case to the npv ratio calculated in the alternate rate scenarios 
the sensitivity measure alone is not necessarily indicative of the interest rate risk of an institution  as institutions with high levels of capital may be able to support a high sensitivity measure 
this measure is evaluated in conjunction with the npv ratio calculated in each scenario 
asb s interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of december  and constitute forward looking statements and were as follows december change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity change from base case in basis points change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity change from base case in basis points change in interest rates basis points base management believes that asb s interest rate risk position at december  represents a reasonable level of risk 
the december  nii profile shows the balance sheet to be liability sensitive in all rising interest rate scenarios 
in rising interest rate environments  the overall rate on liabilities is expected to increase faster than the overall rate on assets 
the expectation of slower prepayment speeds as interest rates rise  reduces the runoff of the existing mortgage assets  which reduces the amount available for reinvestment at the higher market rates 
this constrains the speed with which the yield on the mortgage assets can adjust upwards to market levels 
at the same time  the cost of the liabilities is projected to increase with each increase in the level of rates 
as a result  nii falls in each of the rising rate scenarios 
the analysis shows asb s nii profile as of december  to be slightly more sensitive to rising interest rates than in the december  analysis 
the change in the nii profile from december  to december  is primarily due to the changes in prepayment expectations 
because of slower prepayment expectations in the base case scenario as of december   the improvement in interest income in rising rate scenarios is less than it was in the december  analysis 
as a result  the decrease in nii is greater in the rising rate scenarios as of december  as compared to december  in the basis point scenario  nii falls relative to the base case because expectations of faster mortgage prepayments and lower reinvestment rates cause the yield on mortgage assets to decline faster than in the base case 
additionally  the cost of liabilities does not fall as much because the current low level of rates on existing liabilities limits the amount by which they can decline further 
the net impact is to compress margins  causing nii to fall 
in this analysis  one of the modeling assumptions which impacts the magnitude of the change in nii in response to both rising and falling interest rates is the assumption about the speed and magnitude with which the rate on asb s core deposits change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
asb s base npv ratio as of december  was higher than on december   primarily as a result of changes in the composition of the bank s liabilities 
during  the growth in assets was funded primarily by core deposits 
since core deposits are the lowest cost funding source available to the bank  the use of core deposits as a funding source for growth will have a positive impact on the bank s npv ratio 
asb s npv ratio sensitivity measures as of december  were comparable to the measures as of december  the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the nii sensitivity  npv ratio  and npv ratio sensitivity analyses is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market 
table of contents interest rates  loan prepayments  balance changes and pricing strategies  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
to the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis  actual results may differ materially from the simulation results 
furthermore  nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pre tax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios  and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in asb s current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk 
the simulation does not contemplate any actions that asb management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
further  the changes in nii vary in the twelve month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period 
these analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent management s views of future market movements  the level of future earnings  or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon 
the actual impact of changes in interest rates on nii will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change  as well as management s responses to the changes in interest rates 
other than bank the company s general policy is to manage other than bank interest rate risk through use of a combination of short term debt  long term debt primarily fixed rate debt and preferred securities
