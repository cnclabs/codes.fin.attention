item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements and other financial information included in this form k for the year ended march  see forward looking statements and item business risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of automated employment and income verification and tax management services and a leader in providing payroll and human resources business process outsourcing 
we provide services that enable large and mid size corporations  including approximately two thirds of fortune companies  as well as government agencies  to outsource the performance of payroll and human resources business processes that would otherwise be performed by their own payroll or human resources department 
our services use web access  interactive voice response  fax  document imaging and other technologies to enable mortgage lenders  pre employment screeners  credit issuers  social service agencies and other authorized users to obtain payroll and human resources information and allow employees and their managers to review and modify information in payroll and human resources management information systems on a self service basis 
further  we provide unemployment insurance claims processing  unemployment tax planning and management services  and employment related tax credit and incentive services to a broad range of employers 
our focus is on eliminating paper and manual steps from routine payroll and human resources related processes 
we interact with various payroll systems and human resources services  but are virtually independent of the solutions our clients select 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  effective april   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the unemployment compensation  employment verification and applicant screening and hiring workflow services businesses of sheakley uniservice  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  sheakley interactive services  llc  which we refer to collectively as the sheakley businesses 
additionally  on october   we completed the acquisition of the stock of tbt enterprises  incorporated and ui advantage  inc  headquartered in gaithersburg  maryland  which we collectively refer to as tbt enterprises 
on october   we completed the acquisition of net profit  inc  headquartered in greenville  south carolina 
these acquisitions enhance our existing tax management services offerings by allowing us to offer clients expanded services in connection with processing of the federally reinstated work opportunity wotc and welfare to work wtw tax credits  as well as assisting clients in calculating certain other federal and state tax credits which were not previously a part of our service offerings 
as a result of these acquisitions  in the third quarter of fiscal  we renamed as tax management services our service offerings we previously referred to as unemployment cost management services 
we believe that this new name better represents the breadth of services we now offer in the tax management field 
our services and products fall within three business segments the work number services  tax management services and customer premises systems and related maintenance and support 
the work number services include our employment verification and services  w express  epayroll  fastime  hirexpress  and i express  tax management services include our employment tax consulting and claim processing operations  unemployment tax planning services  and employment related tax credit and incentive services  and customer premises systems and maintenance and support relate to a business we are phasing out 
on january   we declared a for stock split  which was effected in the form of a percent stock dividend  payable february   to shareholders of record january  earnings per share and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding throughout this annual report on form k have been retroactively adjusted for the for stock split 
we achieved record revenues and gross margin in fiscal we successfully executed our strategies and emphasized cross selling services to our existing client base 
we continued to make strategic acquisitions and realized operational efficiencies as we integrated these acquisitions 
additionally  we broadened our portfolio of services  both through innovations in house and through our strategic acquisitions 
our revenues rose percent to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
our earnings from continuing operations in fiscal increased percent to million  or per diluted share  including an sec settlement charge of million  or per diluted share 
earnings from continuing operations totaled million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the work number services achieved record revenues in fiscal year  increasing percent to million compared to million the prior year 
growth in revenues was primarily attributable to the increased records in the database  coupled with the continued broadening of our verifier base 
additionally  the acquisitions of the sheakley employment verification business and hirexpress  our applicant screening and hiring workflow services business  also contributed to the increase in revenues in fiscal year through a program we call reach  we are seeking to increase the number of transactions within our existing verifier base vertically by expanding usage with verifiers that have multiple locations and integrating our services with the verifiers systems and processes 
also through the reach program  we are seeking to increase transactions horizontally by identifying additional usages for the work number database within our existing verifier base 
additionally  through a focused marketing campaign  we have gained additional verifiers  particularly within the automobile financing sector 
gross margin for this business improved basis points to percent from percent the year before 
the improvement in gross margin resulted from higher transaction levels  as well as increased use of cost effective web based programs to deliver employment verification  time reporting and electronic payroll services 
the total number of employment records on the work number services increased to million at march  from million a year ago  representing a percent gain 
total employment records under contract  including those in contract backlog to be added to the database  increased percent to million at march  from million a year earlier 
revenues in the tax management services line of business increased percent to million  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisitions in fiscal year  as noted above 
the tax management services business continued to be an important contributor to our overall profitability as well as to the growth in the work number services  resulting from selling those services to our tax management services client base 
gross margin in the tax management business increased basis points to percent from percent in the fiscal year 
the improved gross margin is primarily a result of efficiencies achieved as acquisitions become fully integrated 
pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated april   we acquired jon jay associates  inc  which specializes in providing unemployment cost management services as well as an employment verification service  for approximately million  including transaction costs  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
additionally  the acquisition agreement includes provisions for potential earn out payments if certain future financial performance measures are achieved through the twelve months ending april  and april   respectively 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated april   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of glick glick consultants  llc  which specializes in employment related tax credit and incentive services  for approximately million  including transaction costs 
the purchase prices were determined based on arms length negotiations  and were paid in cash financed through our loan agreement as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
total revenues for these businesses were approximately million for calendar year the acquisition agreements provide for indemnification of the company by the sellers for certain pre closing liabilities and obligations of the business  subject to certain limitations 
escrow accounts  maintained pursuant to the terms of respective escrow agreements  are also available until two years following the purchases to satisfy the indemnification obligations under the purchase agreements  subject to certain limitations described in the acquisition agreements 
of the purchase prices  million was paid into the escrow accounts 
restatements of financial statements restatement in january  we restated certain historical financial statements as a result of adjustments related to our customer premises systems business 
the restatement was necessary because an internal accounting review in the third quarter of fiscal year showed that certain revenues for customer premises systems contracts were recorded earlier than was appropriate under the percentage of completion methodology used for this line of business 
although we ultimately realized the revenues from the transactions under review  our financial results were not accurately presented  requiring the restatement 
the resulting restatement affected fiscal years ended march  through and the first two quarters of fiscal year additionally  we corrected three errors related to bill and hold arrangements on hardware and software transactions arising out of the customer premises systems line of business during the fiscal years ended march  and these adjustments resulted in movements of revenue and related costs between quarters for each year 
there was no impact to the annual financial results of either fiscal year 
the restatement had practically no cumulative impact on our financial results or our financial condition 
it had the effect of reducing revenues by  for fiscal years  and and increasing revenues by a similar amount in fiscal years and the impact on the fiscal years presented   and  was a reduction of revenue in of  and an increase of revenues in and of  and  respectively 
in addition to the revenue adjustments  the related commissions associated with the revenues were adjusted accordingly and the income taxes provisions were amended to reflect the impact of these restatements 
after adjustment for the for stock split  the annual impact to diluted earnings per share was a reduction to fiscal year of  an increase to fiscal year of  a reduction to fiscal year of and increases to fiscal years and of and  respectively 
our review focused on contracts in which revenue was realized in fiscal and subsequent periods as reliable historical data was not available for earlier periods 
accordingly  our review included contracts for which services were initiated in periods prior to fiscal the review of certain contracts resulted in cumulative adjustments for periods prior to fiscal which have been attributed to fiscal  the earliest fiscal period presented for financial disclosure purposes 
while it is possible that certain of these adjustments related to periods prior to fiscal  data was not available to accurately support the specific allocation to such prior periods 
such data was not available since we had modified our systems during fiscal and had not retained sufficient comparable data for contracts entered into prior to the modification 
while further review may have resulted in adjustments to increase revenue in by decreasing revenues in prior periods  based on the review performed  management believes that further adjustments were not supportable 
the adjustments also impacted our consolidated balance sheet based on the respective revenue amounts  resulting in a restatement of our work in progress and deferred revenues 
in addition  accrued expenses were restated to give effect to the impact on accrued commissions  and deferred income taxes were restated for the related tax effect 
see our form k a for the fiscal year ending march  regarding the impact of our prior restatement on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets 
the prior restatement had no impact on our total cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
restatement in response to inquiries made by the securities and exchange commission during the course of its investigation  we reviewed  during our december quarter  the accounting treatment for two items in the year ended march  in december  we subsequently restated certain of our previously issued financial statements 
the two items reviewed were the accounting for a patent technology license agreement and the award of certain bonus payments to the executive officers 
the million paid in connection with the patent technology license entered into with ronald a 
katz technology licensing  lp and ad  lp in march had been recorded as an intangible asset and was being amortized over a year period 
we decided to expense the entire amount in the march quarter 
certain bonus payments to the executive officers  recommended by the compensation committee and approved by the board of directors on may   totaling approximately  had been reflected as an expense related to the quarter ended june  we decided to record the entire expense in the quarter ended march  the effect of these restatements on the consolidated statement of earnings was to reduce earnings for the year ended march  by million  after income tax  and to increase earnings over the following year period by the same dollar amount in the aggregate 
see our form k a for the fiscal year ending march  regarding the impact of our prior restatement on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets 
the prior restatement had no impact on our total cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  capitalized software and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies include our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition all revenues are generally recognized pursuant to annual or multi year contracts 
revenues from the work number are realized primarily from transaction fees and  to a lesser degree  based on up front set up fees and periodic maintenance fees 
revenues for transaction fees are recognized in the period that they are earned  based on fees charged to users at the time they conduct verifications of employment and income 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 the revenue for set up fees and monthly maintenance fees is recognized on a straight line basis from the time the service is available to be used by our clients through the end of the service period 
revenue for our w service is recognized evenly from the time the service is available for use by talx clients through the end of the service period 
additionally  we have some clients that are billed for this service on a transactional basis 
for these clients  we recognize revenue on a monthly basis  as transactions occur 
we charge epayroll clients on a per employee  per month basis  plus an initial set up fee 
revenue for the initial set up fees is recognized evenly over the initial contract period  beginning with the date the client is live on our system 
per employee  per month fees are recognized as revenue in the months billed 
fastime clients are billed for initial set up fees  monthly maintenance fees and per transaction fees 
revenue is recognized evenly from the time the service is available for use by our clients through the end of the service period for setup and maintenance fees and as services are performed for transaction based fees 
hirexpress clients are billed for initial set up fees and per transaction fees or monthly fees 
revenue is recognized evenly from the time the service is available for use by our clients through the end of the service period for set up fees and as services are performed for transaction based or monthly fees 
revenues from our unemployment cost management services  called uc express  are recognized in the period that they are earned  evenly over the life of the contract 
transaction fees are recorded as the services are provided 
tax management service revenue that is contingent upon achieving certain performance criteria is recognized when those criteria are met 
in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  revenues from implementations of system enhancements related to our former customer premises systems line of business were recognized by the contract method of accounting using the percentage of completion method for larger  more complex implementations and the completed contract method for smaller implementations 
we recognized revenue in this line of business related to hardware and software sales upon shipment of the hardware and related software  in accordance with the sales contracts and considerations of sop for multiple element arrangements  as well as vendor specific objective evidence 
revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues for professional services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the professional services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
in relationships with certain of our customers  we enter into agreements with more than one of our service offerings included in the arrangement 
when a client contracts with us to provide more than one service  the terms of the underlying contract itemize each service provided and the related fees for each service 
in accordance with the consensus of emerging issues task force issue no 
 as these fee arrangements are similar to those charged to other clients  we recognize revenue on the basis of the fair values of the underlying services 
deferred revenue represents the unearned portion of the work number set up fees  uc express and maintenance fees 
commissions paid are deferred and charged to expense proportionally over the related service period 
direct expenses related to cost of revenues are tracked separately for each service we provide 
incremental direct costs that are related to the origination of a client contract are expensed as incurred

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
through the use of an independent business appraiser  we reviewed our goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and determined that no impairment existed 
capitalized software software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is achieved  after which time they are capitalized on a product by product basis 
we amortize capitalized software development costs evenly over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  generally three years 
we begin amortization of capitalized software development costs when the product is available for general release to clients 
we review all capitalized software assets for impairment as of each balance sheet date 
upon determination of any impairment  we write down the asset to the appropriate value in the period that the impairment is determined 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting  known as temporary differences 
we record the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future periods and deferred tax liabilities generally items that we received a tax deduction for  but have not yet been recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

additionally  the acquisitions of the sheakley employment verification business and hirexpress  our applicant screening and hiring workflow services business  also contributed to the increase in revenues in fiscal year through a program we call reach  we are seeking to increase the number of transactions within our existing verifier base vertically by expanding usage with verifiers that have multiple locations and integrating our services with the verifiers systems and processes 
also through the reach program  we are seeking to increase transactions horizontally by identifying additional usages for the work number database within our existing verifier base 
additionally  through a focused marketing campaign  we have gained additional verifiers  particularly within the automobile financing sector 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to an increase in transaction volume resulting from marketing efforts directed to verifiers and employers  partially offset by lower average transaction fees due to the increase in transactions from users with volume pricing discounts and the impact of former users moving to other means of access 
we also experienced increased transaction volumes in due to an increase in the number of employers and related employment records in the database 
the mortgage industry  the consumer finance industry  and pre employment screeners are the primary revenue generators for the work number 
verifications in the consumer finance area have increased significantly over the last year as we have focused on extending our reach to additional consumer finance lenders  such as lenders for automobile  furniture and appliance loans 
mortgage related verifications declined as a percentage of total verifications in fiscal year compared to the prior year primarily as a result of overall economic factors 
the balance between mortgage related and pre employment related verification revenues began to shift back from its widest spread in the first quarter of fiscal towards a more traditional balance towards the end of fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we gradually increased the revenues from collection companies and social services agencies

the uc express revenue stream is one of multi year contracts that provide a solid revenue base with upside potential through contingency billings from tax consulting  or additional billings if claims processed  or other performance measures  exceed contractually set levels 
beginning in the fiscal year  uncertain economic conditions contributed to a reduction in activity in our tax consulting business 
in addition  claims activity was less than expected and we did not realize the anticipated additional billings 
customer premises systems and maintenance and support segment revenues from customer premises systems decreased in fiscal and as we have been diminishing this business over the past several years 
during fiscal we completely eliminated sales of customer premises systems 
revenues from maintenance and support related to the customer premises systems declined to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal we anticipate maintenance and support revenues will continue to decrease over time from current levels as our installed base continues to shrink as supported systems approach the end of their life cycles 
additionally  during  we notified our maintenance clients of our intention to discontinue all support services effective june in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of requests from a number of our clients  we agreed to extend these support services until december in the first quarter of fiscal  we agreed to extend these support services until march gross profit and gross margin

the decrease in gross profit and gross margin in fiscal year was due primarily to temporary incremental costs related to our efforts to consolidate our operational infrastructure following the acquisitions 
the tax management services business has been an important contributor to our overall profitability as well as to the growth in the work number services due to success in cross selling the work number services into the tax management services client base 
customer premises systems and maintenance and support segment customer premises systems and maintenance and support gross profit decreased to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decline in gross profit is due to the fixed nature of personnel and infrastructure costs even as our installed base continues to shrink 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  such expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in expenses in fiscal were primarily due to increased commissions and incentives  which resulted from our higher revenues  as well as increased personnel as we developed a new sales and service team to market directly to verifiers 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues improved in fiscal as a result of the higher revenue levels  improved leveraging of our selling and marketing infrastructure and our continued focus on expense control 
increased selling and marketing expenses in fiscal were primarily due to increased costs related to our reorganization of the sales and services teams 
in addition to realigning our sales and service teams into regions  we added personnel and related costs 
additionally  marketing costs increased in fiscal as we increased our efforts to market to high volume verifiers of the work number 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in such expenses in fiscal resulted primarily from additional amortization related to intangible assets from our three acquisitions and the expansion of our infrastructure to accommodate our growing business and the financial consolidation of the acquisitions described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of revenues  such expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to improved leveraging of personnel and infrastructure costs 
sec settlement charge 
in fiscal  the securities and exchange commission accepted our offer of settlement to resolve its investigation into our accounting for certain items  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the offer of settlement  we agreed to pay one dollar in disgorgement and million in civil penalties 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net totaled million of other expense in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to increased borrowings resulting from funding our acquisitions in the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to a lower level of outstanding borrowings throughout fiscal compared to fiscal income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate was   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the sec settlement charge  as discussed above  was not tax deductible  causing a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth specified unaudited statement of operations data the gross margin percentage for each of our revenue categories  and operating data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues  in each case for each of the four quarters in fiscal and fiscal the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements contained herein and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not necessarily be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we had initially recorded the sec settlement charge in the first quarter of fiscal as other income expense  net 
it has been reclassified to operating expenses in the accompanying table of quarterly results of operations to conform to current presentation to more accurately reflect the nature of this charge

seasonality revenues generated from our w express service  which is part of the work number services segment  are particularly affected by seasonality and are principally earned in our fourth fiscal quarter 
revenues generated from our tax management services are generally higher in the fourth fiscal quarter as certain client contracts allow us to bill additional fees based upon actual annual claims volumes

at march   we had no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facilities and operating leases  but would expect capital expenditures to increase during the next months as we integrate the operations of our new acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline was due primarily to net borrowings under credit arrangements of million in compared to million in in both years  borrowings were used to fund acquisitions 
additionally  in fiscal  we paid million in dividends and received million from issuance of common stock in connection with employee benefit plans 
our working capital increased to million at march  from million at march  this increase is primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at march   as well as the fact that we had no current portion of long term debt at march  as a result of the refinancing of our debt in april  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our accounts receivable increased million to million at march   compared to million at march  the increase was primarily attributable to significantly higher revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
based on cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to pay our obligations as they become due  for at least the next months 
our business strategy contemplates that we will consider acquisitions from time to time 
we cannot assure you that we will make any such additional acquisitions or that any such acquisitions would be successful 
we expect that such acquisitions may require that we access additional credit 
as described below  our loan agreement will provide funding for certain possible future acquisitions subject to certain conditions 
except in these circumstances  we cannot assure you that additional credit would be available on acceptable terms 
any such additional credit would increase the risks associated with leverage  including our ability to service indebtedness and volatility of interest rates 
during fiscal  we continued our quarterly dividend program  declaring a per share dividend in the first quarter and a per share dividend in each of the last three quarters  as adjusted for the effects of the for stock split 
share repurchase plan on september   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to one million shares of our stock in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions during the month period ending september   subject to market conditions and other factors

the may  plan superseded the september  plan  and the remaining  authorized shares that had been authorized for repurchase under the september  plan are no longer available for repurchase 
except for the  shares remaining in the treasury at march   all shares repurchased have been reissued in connection with employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases

the total borrowing under the loan agreement may not exceed million  but we can request that the lenders increase their commitments by up to million to a maximum aggregate amount of million under specified circumstances  in which event the existing lenders or new lenders may agree to provide us with additional availability 
the proceeds of loans made under the loan agreement may be used solely to refinance loans outstanding under the loan agreement and for working capital  permitted capital expenditures  as the source for payment of our obligations with respect to letters of credit  to pay the transaction costs of the loan agreement  to finance permitted acquisitions meeting specified criteria  and to finance certain repurchases of our capital stock subject to specified limitations 
the loan agreement is secured by pledges of our stock and membership interests in  and guarantees of  our subsidiaries and security interests in substantially all of our assets 
loans under the loan agreement mature on april   except that any letters of credit may extend beyond that date if the letter of credit lender approves and we provide sufficient collateral as security for an extended loan 
we may make prepayments on advances under the revolving credit facility without penalty  provided we give at least one business day s notice  pay accrued interest and otherwise make the applicable lenders whole 
as the loan agreement is a year revolving credit facility  there are no scheduled minimum principal repayments in fiscal years through all amounts outstanding under the credit facility are due and payable on april  as a result of the replacement of the loan agreement with a year revolving credit facility  the million owed under the loan agreement has been reclassified to long term debt on the balance sheet as of march  advances under the revolving credit facility bear interest at rates we select  including a base rate or the libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is a variable rate equal to the greater of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus

the loan agreement also requires compliance with certain operating and other covenants which limit  without first obtaining written consent of the lenders  among other things  the ability of talx and our subsidiaries to incur additional debt with specified exceptions  sales of assets  changes in our capital structure  affiliated transactions  acquisitions  and distributions to our shareholders 
the loan agreement generally prohibits the payment of cash dividends  except for cash dividends not in excess of six cents per share per calendar quarter  up to a maximum of million per fiscal year  so long as we are not in default at the time of the declaration 
the loan agreement also contains various representations and warranties  regarding  among others  compliance with material laws  the accuracy of financial statements and other information delivered to the lenders and the absence of material changes 
in the event of a default under the loan agreement  the lenders may terminate the commitments made under the loan agreement  declare amounts outstanding  including accrued interest and fees  payable immediately  and enforce any and all rights and interests 
we have entered into an interest rate swap contract which has a notional amount of million at march  under this contract  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate of libor  which is equal to the libor rate utilized on our outstanding borrowings 
the notional amount of our interest rate swap contract steps down over time until its termination on march  effective april   in connection with the refinancing of our credit facility  we matched our existing interest rate swap to our loan agreement 
this strategy effectively converts a portion of our outstanding borrowings into a fixed rate instrument over the term of the interest rate swap contract 
the interest rate swap and related gains and losses arising on the contract are accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
specifically  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded in other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains or losses are recognized in income when the transactions being hedged are completed

accordingly  the sec settlement charge discussed below was not covered by insurance 
additionally  any further defense costs incurred by us in connection with the sec investigation as indemnification on behalf of our former chief financial officer  craig n 
cohen  and any future related litigation will be borne by us and will not be covered by insurance 
in addition  to the extent that we are required to indemnify mr 
cohen against any fines or penalties assessed against him  those amounts will be borne by us and not be covered by insurance 
the application of any of the foregoing remedies  or the commencement of any regulatory proceeding or enforcement action  could harm our business and financial condition 
regardless of the outcome  litigation of this type is expensive and  until settled or otherwise resolved  may require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend these proceedings

additionally  million of the reserve recognized in the first quarter was reclassified to general and administrative expenses  representing related legal expenses incurred during the fiscal year 
in addition to matters set forth above  we are also party to other lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of conducting our business 
in the opinion of management  after taking into account recorded liabilities  the outcome of these other lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed above under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  our credit facility bears interest at floating rates we select under the terms of the and loan agreements 
as of march   we had million principal outstanding on our credit facility  of which million was hedged with an interest rate swap contract 
on an annual basis  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate  change to our annual interest expense  based on net variable rate borrowings of million
