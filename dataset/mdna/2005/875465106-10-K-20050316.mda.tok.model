base rent per weighted average gla increased by 
per square foot from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period 
the increase is primarily the result of the coroc portfolio acquisition which had a higher average base rent per square foot compared to the pre acquisition portfolio average 
in addition  the overall portfolio occupancy at december  increased from to compared to december  also  base rent is impacted by the amortization of above below market rate lease values associated with the required purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition of the coroc portfolio 
the values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease

the total square footage of the center is now approximately  square feet 
discontinued operations resulted in a loss of approximately  due mainly to the loss on sale of the dalton  georgia property in the period of approximately million 
this loss was partially offset by the gain on sale of the clover and ll bean  new hampshire properties of approximately million in the period 
also  included in the period is the sale of the martinsburg  west virginia center and the casa grande  arizona center which resulted in a net gain of approximately  compared to base rentals increased million  or  in the period when compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to the full year effect of the acquisition of our howell  michigan center in september along with our acquisition of additional gla in january at our sevierville  tennessee center and subsequent expansion at that center in the summer of also  in december  through a joint venture of which we own a one third interest  we completed the acquisition of nine properties in the charter oak portfolio which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
base rent per weighted average gla increased by 
per square foot from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period 
the increase was attributable to the average initial base rent for new stores opened during   being higher than the average base rent of for stores closed during the overall portfolio occupancy at december  decreased from to due to the acquired properties having a lower occupancy rate   than our portfolio   just prior to the acquisition

our ability to attract high volume tenants to many of our outlet centers continues to improve the average sales per square foot throughout our portfolio 
however  many tenants breakpoints are adjusted along with their base rent upon renewal  resulting in a reduction in percentage rentals  but an increase in base rentals 
expense reimbursements  which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance  insurance  property tax  promotional  advertising and management expenses generally fluctuates consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which it relates 
expense reimbursements  expressed as a percentage of property operating expenses remained constant at in and other income increased  or  in compared to primarily due to increases in vending and other miscellaneous income and an increase in fees from managed properties 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  in the period as compared to the period and  on a weighted average gla basis  increased

per square foot from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period 
interest expense decreased million during as compared to due primarily to lower average interest rates during and a decrease in the overall debt level due to the use of the proceeds from the exercise of  share and unit options during the year to reduce outstanding debt 
also  during  we purchased  at a premium  million of our outstanding senior  unsecured public notes that mature in october the purchases were funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit 
these purchases bring the total amount of these notes purchased in the last three years to million 
the replacement of the bonds with funding through lines of credit provided us with a significant interest expense reduction as the lines of credit had a lower interest rate 
depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla decreased from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period due to a lower mix of tenant finishing allowances included in buildings and improvements which are depreciated over shorter lives ie over lives generally ranging from to years as opposed to other construction costs which are depreciated over lives ranging from to years 
equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures increased  in the period compared to the period due to the twmb s outlet center in myrtle beach  south carolina being open for a full year in compared to six months in  and an expansion of  square feet that occurred in may of discontinued operations resulted in a gain of approximately million due mainly to a number of centers with positive operating income included in discontinued operations for the period 
the period included gains of million from the sales of our centers in fort lauderdale  florida and bourne  massachusetts and  in gains from the sales of leased land outparcels which had identifiable cash flows associated with them and were therefore accounted for under the provisions of sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities from to is primarily due to the incremental income from the coroc acquisition in december the increase from to is due to the increase in income after adjustments for non cash items and changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other assets as well as a decrease of million in interest expense 
the increase in other assets is due primarily to the cash paid for the ground lease at the rehoboth beach  delaware center acquired in december net cash provided by used in investing activities amounted to  and million during  and  respectively  and reflects the acquisitions  expansions and dispositions of real estate during each year 
net cash provided by used in financing activities of and million in  and  respectively  has fluctuated consistently with the capital needed to fund the current development and acquisition activity and reflects increases in dividends paid during  and in addition  reflects million of distributions to our partner in the coroc joint venture which was created in december also  the increase in cash provided by financing activities in is due primarily to the contribution by blackstone related to the coroc acquisition and the net proceeds from the issuance of common shares 
in  million common shares were issue versus million common shares in also  approximately million more share and unit options were exercised in versus dispositions and current developments any developments or expansions that we  or a joint venture that we are involved in  have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled  or may not result in accretive net income or funds from operations 
in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties 
we may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties 
any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated  or if consummated  may not result in an increase in net income or funds from operations

accordingly  a debt premium of million was recorded and is being amortized over the life of the debt 
the premium was million at december  we funded the majority of our share of the equity required for the transaction through the issuance of million common shares on december   generating approximately million in net proceeds 
the results of the charter oak portfolio have been included in the consolidated financial statements since december  we believe the charter oak acquisition solidifies our position in the outlet industry 
in addition  the centers acquired provide an excellent geographic fit  a diversified tenant portfolio and are in line with our strategy of creating an increased presence in high end resort locations 
we have joint control with blackstone over major decisions 
if blackstone does not receive an annual minimum cash return of on their invested capital during any of the first three years and in any year thereafter  blackstone shall gain the right to become the sole managing member of the joint venture with complete authority to act for the joint venture  including the ability to dispose of one or more of the joint venture properties to a third party 
based on current available cash flows from the properties  we do not believe there is a significant risk of default under this provision 
we provide operating  management  leasing and marketing services to the properties and earn an annual management and leasing fee equal to per square foot of gross leasable area 
we also earn an additional annual incentive fee of up to approximately  if certain annual increases in the net operating income are met on an annual basis 
these fees are payable prior to  and are not subordinate to  any member distributions that may be required 
blackstone has the right to terminate the management agreement for the joint venture if it does not receive its minimum cash return as described above

we will then receive a distribution equal to our invested capital and an additional annual preferred cash distribution

twmb associates  llc in september  we established twmb  a joint venture in which we have a ownership interest with rosen warren myrtle beach llc rosen warren as our venture partner  to construct and operate a tanger outlet center in myrtle beach  south carolina 
the company and rosen warren each contributed million in cash for a total initial equity in twmb of million 
in june the first phase opened leased at a cost of approximately million with approximately  square feet and brand name outlet tenants 
during  we completed our  square foot second phase 
the second phase cost approximately million 
the company and rosen warren each contributed approximately million toward the second phase which contains additional brand name outlet tenants 
during  we completed a  square foot third phase 
the third phase cost approximately million 
the company and rosen warren each made capital contributions during the fourth quarter of of million for the third phase 
twmb s myrtle beach center now totals  square feet 
in conjunction with the construction of the center  twmb closed on a construction loan in the amount of million with bank of america  na agent and wachovia corporation due in september as of december  the construction loan had a balance of million 
in august of  twmb entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america  na effective through august with a notional amount of million 
under this agreement  twmb received a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and paid a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changed the payment of interest on million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt for the contract period at a rate of 
the construction loan incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property as well as joint and several guarantees by rosen warren and the company 
twmb has a commitment letter from bank of america for permanent financing with the center serving as collateral 
the loan is expected to be million with a variable interest rate of libor plus 
the term is for five years with interest payments only and may be extended for an additional two years 
there are no guarantees associated with the loan 
we expect to close on the permanent financing during the first half of either partner in twmb has the right to initiate the sale or purchase of the other party s interest at certain times 
if such action is initiated  one member would determine the fair market value purchase price of the venture and the other would determine whether they would take the role of seller or purchaser 
the members roles in this transaction would be determined by the tossing of a coin  commonly known as a russian roulette provision 
if either partner enacts this provision and depending on our role in the transaction as either seller or purchaser  we could potentially incur a cash outflow for the purchase of our partner s interest 
however  we do not expect this event to occur in the near future based on the positive results and expectations of developing and operating an outlet center in the myrtle beach  south carolina area 
deer park enterprise  llc during the third quarter of  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  tanger deer park  llc tanger deer park 
in september  tanger deer park entered into a joint venture agreement with two other members to create deer park enterprise  llc deer park

deer park s bank of america loan incurs interest at a floating interest rate equal to libor plus and is collateralized by the property as well as joint and several guarantees by all three parties

accordingly  a debt premium of million was recorded and is being amortized over the life of the debt 
the premium had a value of million as of december  the dalton  georgia property as mentioned above in dispositions served as collateral in a cross collateralized mortgage with john hancock life insurance company john hancock along with several other properties 
upon its disposition  the dalton property was released as collateral and replaced with a million standby letter of credit issued by bank of america 
the letter of credit includes an issuance fee of annually 
the required amount of the letter of credit decreases ratably over the remaining term of the john hancock mortgage which matures in april throughout the term of the letter of credit  its required amount serves as a reduction in the amount available under our unsecured million line of credit with bank of america 
during  we obtained an additional million unsecured line of credit from citicorp north america  inc  a subsidiary of citigroup  bringing the total committed unsecured lines of credit to million 
in addition  we completed the extension of the maturity dates on all of our lines of credit with bank of america  wachovia corporation  wells fargo bank and citigroup until june of amounts available under these facilities at december  totaled million 
interest is payable based on alternative interest rate bases at our option 
during  we have two secured loans maturing with new york life insurance company totaling approximately million and carrying an average interest rate of 
we expect to repay these loans with amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit 
we intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital  including public debt or equity  to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in our shareholders best interests 
prior to the  and common share offerings  we had established a shelf registration to allow us to issue up to million in either all debt or all equity or any combination thereof 
in september  we completed a public offering of million common shares at a price of per share  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds  together with other available funds  to acquire one outlet center in howell  michigan  to reduce the outstanding balance on our lines of credit and for general corporate purposes 
in december  we completed a public offering of million common shares at a price of per share  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used together with other available funds to finance our portion of the equity required to acquire the charter oak portfolio of outlet shopping centers and for general corporate purposes 
in addition in january  the underwriters of the december offering exercised in full their over allotment option to purchase an additional  common shares at the offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of the over allotment 
to generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities  we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures  selling certain properties that do not meet our long term investment criteria as well as the sale of outparcels on existing properties 
at december   approximately of our outstanding long term debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered 
the average interest rate  including loan cost amortization  on average debt outstanding for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
we maintain unsecured  revolving lines of credit that provide for unsecured borrowings up to million at december   an increase of million in capacity from december  during  we extended the maturity of all lines of credit to june  based on cash provided by operations  existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or equity subject to market conditions  we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during we anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with real estate investment trust reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of december  in thousands contractual obligations thereafter debt       interest payments      operating leases       these amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements 
all of our variable rate agreements are based on the day libor rate 
for calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt  the rate at december  was used 
our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios  including debt service coverage and leverage  and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed ffo  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or of ffo on a cumulative basis 
we have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants  however  should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default  the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt 
we operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the code 
a reit which distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
based on our taxable income to shareholders  we were required to distribute approximately million in order to maintain our reit status as described above 
we distributed approximately million to common shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions 
if events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced  we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our reit status 
the following table details our commercial commitments as of december  in thousands commercial commitments lines of credit  unconsolidated joint venture guarantees  we currently maintain four unsecured  revolving credit facilities with major national banking institutions  totaling million

the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on a contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
during august  twmb had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that expired naturally 
under this agreement  twmb received a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and paid a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changed the payment of interest on million of variable rate construction debt to fixed rate debt for the contract period at a rate of 
as of december   we had no interest rate swap agreements 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million while the recorded value was million  respectively 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our wholly owned subsidiaries  as well as the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments in real estate joint ventures that represent non controlling ownership interests are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
under the provisions of fin r  we are considered the primary beneficiary of our joint venture  coroc 
therefore  the results of operations and financial position of coroc are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued fin r which clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin r were effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities in and thereafter 
we have evaluated deer park and twmb note and have determined that under the current facts and circumstances we are not required to consolidate these entities under the provisions of fin r 
acquisition of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations fas  we allocate the purchase price of material acquisitions based on the fair value of land  building  tenant improvements  debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles  such as the value of leases with above or below market rents  origination costs associated with the in place leases  and the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  if any 
we depreciate the amount allocated to building  deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from three to years 
the values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
the value associated with in place leases and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term of the relationship  which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal and its estimated term 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs will be written off 
the tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
if we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property  deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets  our computation of depreciation expense may be significantly understated or overstated 
cost capitalization in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
 we capitalize all incremental  direct fees and costs incurred to initiate operating leases  including certain general and overhead costs  as deferred charges 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to executing these leases 
we amortize these costs to expense over the estimated average minimum lease term 
we capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties  including certain general and overhead costs and interest costs 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets 
direct costs to acquire assets are capitalized once the acquisition becomes probable 
if we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such an event  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount  and if less  recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
if we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts  our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long lived assets 
we believe that no impairment existed at december  revenue recognition base rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants sales volume percentage rentals and reimbursement of the tenants share of advertising and promotion  common area maintenance  insurance and real estate tax expenses 
percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met 
expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue over the remaining lease term  as adjusted to reflect the early termination date 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment fas r 
fas r is a revision of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  fas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
fas r is effective beginning with the third quarter of fas r should have no affect on our results of operations as we adopted its requirements effective january  as described above 
economic conditions and outlook the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
during  we have approximately  square feet or of our portfolio coming up for renewal 
if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we renewed of the  square feet that came up for renewal in with the existing tenants at an average base rental rate approximately equal to the expiring rate 
we also re tenanted  square feet during at a increase in the average base rental rate 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
the existing tenants have already renewed approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in as of february  in addition  we continue to attract and retain additional tenants 
our factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  we reduce our operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of our combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
as of december   occupancy at our portfolio of centers in which we have an ownership interest increased from to compared to december  consistent with our long term strategy of re merchandising centers  we will continue to hold space off the market until an appropriate tenant is identified 
while we believe this strategy will add value to our centers in the long term  it may reduce our average occupancy rates in the near term 
sales at our outlet centers along the east coast and the gulf of mexico were adversely affected by the hurricanes in september fortunately  the structural damage caused by the hurricanes was minimal and our property insurance will cover the vast majority of the repair work that is being completed as well as lost revenues during the days the centers were closed 
customer traffic at these centers  particularly our center in foley  alabama  however continues to be down significantly 
we do not expect this to have a material impact on our financial results
