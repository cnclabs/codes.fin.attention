item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to further the reader s understanding of the consolidated financial statements  financial condition and results of operations of imclone systems 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and under risk factors set forth in item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview imclone systems is a biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to advance oncology care by developing and commercializing a portfolio of targeted treatments designed to address the medical needs of patients with cancer 
our lead product  erbitux is a first of its kind antibody approved by the fda for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
erbitux binds specifically to epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  her  c erbb on both normal and tumor cells  and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor egf and other ligands  such as transforming growth factor alpha 
we are conducting  and in some cases have completed  potential registration studies evaluating erbitux for the treatment of colorectal  head and neck and pancreatic cancers  as well as other indications 
on february   the fda approved erbitux for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
on june  the fda approved our chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc supplemental biologics license application sbla for licensure of our manufacturing facility referred to as bb on december   swissmedic  the swiss agency for therapeutic products  approved erbitux in switzerland for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer who no longer respond to standard chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan 
on june  merck kgaa received marketing approval by the european commission to sell erbitux for use in combination with irinotecan for the treatment of patients with egfr expressing metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of irinotecan including cytotoxic therapy in all members of the european union  as well as iceland and norway in accordance with local legal regulations 
in addition  erbitux has been approved in argentina  chile and mexico 
our revenues  as well as our results of operations  have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period due to several factors  including but not limited to the amount and timing of revenues earned from commercial sales of erbitux  the timing of when we begin to reflect full absorption cost of goods sold on sales of erbitux to our corporate partners  the timing of recognition of license fees and milestone revenues  the status of development of our various product candidates  whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones  timely payment by our corporate partners of amounts payable to us  legal costs and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and investigations  and the addition or termination of research programs or funding support and variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary product candidates during any given period 
as a result of our substantial investment in research and development  we have incurred significant operating losses and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we anticipate that our accumulated deficit will continue to decrease in the future as we earn revenues on commercial sales of erbitux and generate net income 
although we have historically devoted most of our efforts and resources to research and development  we expect to devote greater efforts and resources to the manufacturing  marketing  and commercialization of erbitux 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully manufacture  market or commercialize erbitux or that potential customers will buy erbitux 
we rely entirely on third party manufacturers for filling and finishing services with respect to erbitux 
if our current third party manufacturers or critical raw material suppliers fail to meet our expectations  we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into new agreements with other suppliers or third party manufacturers without an adverse effect on our business 
highlights and outlook was very much a year of transition  growth and profitability for us at imclone systems 
erbitux was approved for use in certain patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer just over a year ago 
thanks to the economics of our partnership with bms and a successful product launch  we were able to achieve profitability within the launch quarter and in the subsequent two quarters 
for a company that had been generating losses for almost its entire year history and given the typical growing pains experienced by companies making such a transformation  this rapid transition to sustained profitability was no small achievement 
with this rapid success has come a higher level of complexity from a financial standpoint 
for the year  we recorded a total of million in net income on revenues of million or of total revenues translating into earnings per diluted share of 
erbitux domestic sales in reached million  making it one of the most successful oncology product launches to date 
expenses for the fourth quarter included some one time items  including royalty expenses of approximately million  reflecting the difference between royalty expenses accrued in prior periods and actual obligations resulting from final agreements 
operating expenses also includes a one time charge of million  net of insurance reimbursement  reflecting our settlement of outstanding shareholder and derivative litigation originating from the resolution of these outstanding uncertainties will contribute to a more stable landscape for the company from a financial standpoint 
erbitux has made rapid and significant market inroads in later stages of the disease since its launch less than a year ago 
our data indicate that the market has accepted erbitux as a second and third line therapy and that oncologists have been eager to integrate biologics into their patients treatment regimens 
however  it is still too early to say that the market has settled into a predictable pattern of treatment 
in order to increase our presence and prominence within the oncology community and to help maximize the market potential for erbitux in its approved indications  we established a sales force of oncology sales professionals during the fourth quarter of our sales group will focus on the top or so percent of erbitux prescribers who together represent a total of of all the colorectal cancer market 
we believe that  given the rapidly evolving landscape in colorectal cancer treatment  these individuals will serve as a helpful resource to physicians 
building on this successful launch for erbitux  we continue to make significant advances in clinical and regulatory 
on the regulatory front  we remain on track to file a supplemental biologics license application for erbitux in head and neck cancer in the second quarter of on the clinical front  our comprehensive testing program for erbitux in first and second line non small cell lung cancer announced in the fourth quarter of is now well under way 
beyond erbitux  two new antibodies have begun phase i testing 
these are imc f  a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor  and imc b  a fully human monoclonal antibody designed to bind to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor found on tumor vasculature 
by year end of we expect that we will be testing five antibodies in the clinic  with two additional antibodies to enter the clinic this year  these are imc a  which targets the insulin like growth factor receptor  and imc f  which targets the vegfr receptor 
from a financial perspective  we anticipate that our results in will reflect the following royalty revenue will continue to reflect of bms in market sales and a range of of merck kgaa s in market sales until such time as a contractual minimum of cumulative sales has been reached  thereafter the royalty rate will increase 
license fees and milestone revenue in will include the continuing amortization  based on clinical development spending  of the million received thus far from bms 
at comparable or slightly increased rates of spending from the most recent quarterly amounts  amortization of milestones received to date should approximate million in however  should we receive an additional milestone in the fourth quarter of million  license fees and milestone revenue would increase by approximately million reflecting the catch up effect of receipt of this final milestone 
the selling price to our partners for manufacturing revenue in will be approximately one half of the price in  since the price reflected a significant component of materials sourced from lonza at significantly higher costs than our own manufacturing costs 
collaborative agreement revenue will continue to include the purchase of erbitux for clinical use by our partners  as well as reimbursement by bms of certain regulatory and clinical expenses incurred on behalf of erbitux and such expenses are expected to increase in  and reimbursement for royalty expenses which will approximate of us in market sales  and approximately of sales outside the us research and development expenses are expected to increase by approximately in  reaching an annual total of approximately million 
the increase versus reflects significant additional efforts in support of our non erbitux pipeline development and costs associated with producing clinical supplies of erbitux for use by imclone and our partners 
clinical and regulatory expenses in are expected to increase significantly versus  as we embark on a number of studies in support of expanded use of erbitux as well as phase i clinical development programs for four pipeline products 
total expenses are expected to reach approximately million for the full year 
marketing  general and administrative expenses should approximate million in  an million increase versus except for the incremental costs in support of our recently implemented field force  we are managing the total of all other administrative costs to a net year to year reduction versus gross royalty expenses in for erbitux will include approximately of us in market sales  of which approximately of us in market sales is reimbursed as a component of collaborative agreement revenue  resulting in a net royalty burden to imclone of 
cost of manufacturing revenue will not be fully reflected on our statement of operations until such time as all previously expensed erbitux has been sold through to our partners for either commercial or clinical use 
based on our current expectations of purchases by our partners  we expect to begin to reflect full cost of manufacturing revenue during the third quarter of new accounting rules will require that we include expenses associated with equity based compensation plans as a component of operating expenses beginning in the third quarter of we are currently analyzing the impact to our financial statements 
the single most important determinant in estimating our tax rate for is the assumption made with respect to the potential receipt of a million milestone payment during the calendar year 
if an assumption is made that the milestone is earned this year  we would expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 
conversely  if no milestone is received  we would expect the effective tax rate to be in the low single digits 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates are deemed critical when a different methodology could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate from period to period may have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s critical accounting policies that require management to make significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are set forth below 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived from four primary sources license fees and milestone payments  manufacturing revenue  royalty revenue  and collaborative agreement revenue 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments primarily consist of up front license fees and milestone payments received under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb  relating to erbitux  and milestone payments received under the development and license agreement with merck kgaa 
we recognize all non refundable up front license fees as revenues in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletins no 
and our most critical application of this policy  to date  relates to the  in license fees received from bms and er squibb under the commercial agreement which are being deferred and recognized as revenue based upon the actual product research and development costs incurred since september  to date by bms and er squibb and imclone as a percentage of the estimated total of such costs to be incurred over the year term of the commercial agreement 
the estimated total of such cost is based on the clinical development budget which establishes joint responsibilities that will be carried out by both the company and bms and er squibb for certain clinical and other studies 
of the  in payments received through december    was recognized as revenue during and  from the commencement of the commercial agreement in through december  the methodology used to recognize deferred revenue involves a number of estimates and judgments  such as the estimate of total product research and development costs to be incurred under the commercial agreement 
changes in these estimates and judgments can have a significant effect on the size and timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  if management had chosen a different methodology to recognize the license fee and milestone payments received under the commercial agreement  the company s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
for example  if the company were to recognize the revenues earned from the commercial agreement on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement  the company would have recognized approximately  and  as revenue for the twelve months and from the commencement of the commercial agreement  respectively  through december  management believes that the current methodology used to recognize revenues under the commercial agreement  which reflects the level of effort consistent with the product development activities  is the most appropriate methodology because it reflects the level of expenditure and activity in the period in which it is being spent as compared to the total expected expenditure over the life of the commercial agreement 
this cost to cost approach is systematic and rational  it provides a factually supportable pattern to track progress  and is reflective of the level of effort  which varies over time 
non refundable upfront payments received from merck kgaa were deferred due to our significant continuing involvement and are being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated service period because the activities specified in the agreement between the company and merck kgaa will be performed over the estimated service period and there is no other pattern or circumstances that indicate a different way in which the revenue is earned 
in addition  the development and license agreement with merck kgaa does not contain any provisions for establishing a clinical budget and none has been established between the parties 
this agreement does not call for co development with the company in merck kgaa s territory  rather merck kgaa is solely responsible for regulatory efforts in its territory 
non refundable milestone payments  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  pursuant to collaborative agreements other than the commercial agreement  are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone 
this is because each milestone payment represents the achievement of a substantive step in the research and development process and merck kgaa has the right to evaluate the technology to decide whether to continue with the research and development program as each milestone is reached 
manufacturing revenue consists of revenue earned on the sale of erbitux to our corporate partners for subsequent commercial sale 
the company recognizes manufacturing revenue when the product is shipped  which is when our partners take ownership and title has passed  collectibility is reasonably assured  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and there is persuasive evidence of an agreement 
we are contractually obligated to sell erbitux to bms at our cost of production plus a markup 
we sell bulk inventory to merck kgaa at our full absorption cost of production 
the selling price for erbitux to bms during reflected the weighted average costs of production for inventory previously produced by lonza and at our bb manufacturing plant 
during  we sold all inventory produced by lonza and we anticipate that all production of erbitux in will be performed at our bb manufacturing facility 
therefore  the sales price to our corporate partners in is expected to be significantly lower ie roughly one half than the costs we charged our partner in since our unit cost to manufacture erbitux is significantly lower than the cost paid to lonza for manufacturing erbitux 
the continuing level of manufacturing revenue in future periods may fluctuate significantly based on market demand  our cost of production  as well as bms s required level of safety stock inventory for erbitux 
royalty revenues from licensees  which are based on third party sales of licensed products and technology  are recorded as earned in accordance with contract terms when third party sales can be reliably measured and collection of funds is reasonably assured 
collaborative agreement revenue consists of reimbursements received from bms and er squibb and merck kgaa related to clinical and regulatory studies  erbitux provided to them for use in clinical studies  reimbursement of a portion of royalty expense and certain marketing and administrative costs 
collaborative agreement revenue is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements under the respective contracts 
withholding taxes in january  new york state notified the company that it was liable for the new york state and city income taxes that were not withheld because one or more of the company s employees who exercised certain non qualified stock options in and failed to pay new york state and city income taxes for those years 
on march   the company entered into a closing agreement with new york state  paying  to settle the matter 
subsequently  the company became aware of another potential income and employment tax withholding liability associated with the exercise of certain warrants granted in the early years of the company s existence that were held by certain former officers  directors and employees 
after the company informed new york state of the issue relating to the warrants  new york state  in june  notified the company that it was continuing the previously conducted audit of the company and was evaluating the terms of the closing agreement to determine whether or not it should be re opened 
on march   the company entered into a new closing agreement pursuant to which the company paid new york state an additional  in full satisfaction of all the deficiencies and determinations of withholding taxes for the years as a result  we have utilized  of the liability of  that we previously established for new york withholding taxes on stock options and warrants exercised and have recognized a benefit of  as a recovery in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  on march   the company initiated discussions with the internal revenue service the irs relating to the federal income taxes applicable to the above noted issues 
although the irs has not yet asserted that the company is required to make a payment with respect to such failure to withhold  the irs may assert that such a liability exists  and may further assert that the company is liable for interest and penalties 
the irs has commenced audits of the company s income tax and employment tax returns for tax years through the company is cooperating fully with the irs with respect to these audits  and intends to continue to do so 
the company has not recognized withholding tax liabilities in respect of exercises of certain warrants by robert f 
goldhammer  one of the four former officers or directors to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants 
based on the company s investigation  it believes that  although such warrants were compensatory  such warrants were received by mr 
goldhammer in connection with the performance of services by him in his capacity as a director  rather than as an employee  and  as such  is not subject to tax withholding requirements 
in addition  in  mr 
goldhammer erroneously received a portion of a stock option grant in the form of incentive stock options  which under federal law may only be granted to employees 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will agree with the company s position and will not assert that the company is liable for the failure to withhold income and employment taxes with respect to the exercise of such warrants and any stock options by mr 
goldhammer 
if the company became liable for the failure to withhold taxes on the exercise of such warrants and any stock options by mr 
goldhammer  the aggregate potential liability  exclusive of any interest or penalties  would be approximately  the company has not recognized accruals for penalties and interest that may be imposed with respect to the withholding tax issues previously described and other related contingencies  including the period covered by the statute of limitations and the company s determination of certain exercise dates  because it does not believe that losses from such contingencies are probable  or in the event that any taxing authority makes a claim for penalties or interest  the company believes that it will be able to settle the total amount asserted including any liability for taxes for an amount not in excess of the liability for taxes already accrued with respect to the relevant withholding tax issue 
with respect to the statute of limitations and the company s determination of certain exercise dates  while the company does not believe a loss is probable  there is a potential additional liability with respect to these issues that may be asserted by a taxing authority 
if taxing authorities assert such issues and prevail related to these withholding tax issues and other related contingencies  including penalties  the liability that could be imposed by taxing authorities would be substantial 
the potential interest on the withholding tax liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets could be up to a maximum amount of approximately  at december  potential additional withholding tax liability on other related contingencies amounts to approximately  exclusive of any interest or penalties  and excluding the amount potentially attributable to mr 
goldhammer noted above 
inventories until february   all costs associated with the manufacturing of erbitux were included in research and development expenses when incurred 
effective february   the date after the company received approval from the fda for erbitux  we began to capitalize in inventory the cost of manufacturing erbitux for commercial sale and will expense such cost as cost of manufacturing revenue at the time of sale 
however  as we sell our existing inventory that was previously expensed  there will be a period of time whereby the company will reflect manufacturing revenue with minimal cost 
therefore  we anticipate that our margin on sales of erbitux to our corporate partners will fluctuate from quarter to quarter during for example  effective february   we began to capitalize the cost of producing erbitux including the costs of packaging and labeling bulk inventory previously produced  some of which we subsequently sold and reflected in our consolidated statement of operations during as cost of manufacturing revenue 
the cost of manufacturing revenue reflected in the company s operating expenses during therefore  does not reflect full absorption cost of production because the raw materials  labor and overhead costs incurred to produce the product sold  were previously expensed 
if the company had capitalized inventory prior to obtaining fda approval of erbitux  the cost basis of the inventory sold would be at least of manufacturing revenue or a gross margin of approximately  depending on the relative level of sales to bms and merck kgaa 
we expect that  consistent with  there will be periods in whereby the cost of manufacturing revenue reflected in our operating expenses will primarily reflect costs associated with packaging  labeling and shipping inventory that has been previously expensed 
we also anticipate that there may be a reporting period in that may include a combination of partial cost  and full absorption cost of manufacturing revenue 
therefore  we believe that our manufacturing revenue margin will be distorted for comparison purposes for a significant period after february  depending on market demand for erbitux 
litigation the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings as fully disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 no reserve has been established in our financial statements for certain legal proceedings because we do not believe that such a reserve is required to be established at this time 
however  if in a future period  events in any such legal proceedings render it probable that a loss will be incurred  and if such loss is reasonably estimable at that time  we will establish such a reserve 
thus  it is possible that legal proceedings may have a material adverse impact on the operating results for that period  on our balance sheet or both 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 
assets are considered to be impaired and written down to fair value if expected associated undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying amounts 
fair value is generally determined as the present value of the expected associated cash flows 
we have built bb and are building bb  and purchased a material logistics and warehousing facility and an administrative facility 
bb is dedicated to the clinical and commercial production of erbitux and bb will be a multi use production facility 
erbitux is currently being produced for clinical studies and commercialization at bb the material logistics and warehousing facility includes office space  a storage location and sampling laboratory for erbitux 
a newly renovated administrative facility houses the clinical  regulatory  sales  marketing  finance  human resources  project management and mis departments  as well as certain executive and legal offices and other necessities 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 
changes in regulatory or other business conditions in the future could change our judgments about the carrying value of these facilities  which could result in the recognition of material impairment losses 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
as of december   the company continues to reflect a valuation allowance against its total net deferred tax assets because  more likely than not  its net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
although management believes that the valuation allowance as of december  is appropriate  we expect that as we continue to sell erbitux to our corporate partners for commercial use and earn royalties and income from operations from the expected commercial sales of erbitux  we will need to revise our conclusions regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets due to expected changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
in addition  there may be other factors such as changes in tax laws and future levels of research and development spending that may impact our effective tax rate in the future

of  the increase of  in license fees and milestone revenue from the comparable period in is due to an increase in revenue recognized under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb primarily as a result of the  received in the first quarter of  when we obtained fda approval of erbitux and due to increases in clinical development spending by bms and imclone 
license fees and milestone revenue in will include the continuing amortization  based on clinical development spending  of the million received thus far from bms 
at comparable or slightly increased rates of spending from the most recent quarterly amounts  amortization of milestones received to date should approximate million for the full year 
however  should we receive an additional milestone in the fourth quarter of of million  license fees and milestone revenue would increase by approximately million reflecting the catch up effect of receipt of this final milestone 
manufacturing revenue manufacturing revenue of  in consists of sales of erbitux to our corporate partners for commercial use 
in accordance with the commercial agreement  we are contractually obligated to sell erbitux to bms at our cost of production plus a markup 
we sell bulk inventory to merck kgaa at our full absorption cost of production 
there were no sales of erbitux to merck kgaa during the selling price for erbitux to our corporate partners is based on the full absorption costs of production incurred  which during reflected the weighted average costs of production for inventory previously produced by lonza and at our bb manufacturing plant

therefore  the sales price to our corporate partners in is expected to be significantly lower than the price we charged our partner in since our unit cost to manufacture erbitux is significantly lower than the cost paid to lonza for manufacturing erbitux 
the continuing level of manufacturing revenue in future periods may fluctuate significantly based on market demand  our cost of production  as well as bms s required level of safety stock inventory for erbitux 
royalty revenue royalty revenue consists primarily of royalty payments earned on the sale of erbitux by our partners  bms and merck kgaa 
under our agreement with bms  we are entitled to royalty payments equal to of bms s net sales of erbitux in the united states and canada 
under our agreement with merck kgaa  we are entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of gross margin of merck kgaa s sales of erbitux outside the united states and canada 
during  we earned royalties from bms of  on net sales of erbitux of approximately million and royalties from merck kgaa of  on net sales of erbitux of approximately million 
royalty revenue in will continue to reflect of bms net in market sales and a range of of merck kgaa s in market sales until such time as a contractual minimum of cumulative sales has been reached  thereafter the royalty rate will increase 
collaborative agreement revenue collaborative agreement revenue consists primarily of reimbursements from our partners bms and er squibb and merck kgaa under our collaborative agreements 
there are certain categories for which we receive reimbursement from our partners clinical and regulatory expenses  the cost of erbitux supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies  certain marketing and administrative expenses and a portion of royalty expense

the increase in collaborative agreement revenue of  is principally due to royalty expense reimbursed by our corporate partners of approximately  and an increase in drug shipments to our partners of approximately  partly offset by a decrease in clinical and regulatory reimbursement 
collaborative agreement revenue in will continue to include the purchase of erbitux for clinical use by our partners  as well as reimbursement by bms of certain regulatory and clinical expenses incurred on behalf of erbitux and such expenses are expected to increase in  and reimbursement for royalty expenses which will approximate of us in market sales  and approximately of sales outside the us research and development research and development expenses in and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or

research and development include costs that are reimbursable from our corporate partners 
approximately  and  of costs representing research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  were reimbursed and included under collaborative agreement revenue since they represent inventory supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies 
the decrease in research and development expenses of  in was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately  related to costs incurred in connection with the manufacturing of erbitux by lonza  a contract manufacturer  and a decrease of approximately  reflecting the capitalization of inventory costs subsequent to february  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately  due to a significant increase in headcount from the comparable period in and an overall increase in salary and benefit expenses 
research and development expenses are expected to increase by approximately in  reaching an annual total of approximately million

clinical and regulatory expenses in are expected to increase significantly versus  as we embark on a number of studies in support of expanded use of erbitux as well as phase clinical development programs for four pipeline products 
total expenses are expected to reach approximately million for the year ended december  marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses include marketing and administrative personnel costs  including related facility costs  additional costs to develop internal marketing and field operations capabilities and expenses associated with applying for patent protection for our technology and products 
marketing  general and administrative expenses also include amounts reimbursable from our corporate partners 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in amounted to  an increase of  or from the comparable period in this increase is partly due to increases in personnel costs of approximately  due to increased headcount and marketing expenses incurred to support the commercialization of erbitux and an increase of approximately  in professional services fees related to legal  consulting and marketing research and marketing conventions  offset by a charge of approximately  in related to a termination agreement with a former officer of the company 
some expenses in this category are reimbursable from our corporate partners 
approximately  and  of costs representing marketing and general expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  were reimbursed and included in collaborative agreement revenue in order to increase our presence and prominence within the oncology community and to help maximize the market potential for erbitux in its approved indications  we established a sales force of oncology sales professionals during the fourth quarter of our sales group will focus on the top or so percent of erbitux prescribers who together represent a total of of all the crc market 
we believe that  given the rapidly evolving landscape in colorectal cancer treatment  these individuals will serve as a helpful resource to physicians 
marketing  general and administrative expenses should approximate million in  an million increase versus except for the incremental costs in support of our recently implemented field force  we are managing all other administrative costs to a net year to year reduction versus cost of manufacturing revenue effective february   the company began to capitalize in inventory the costs of manufacturing of erbitux for commercial sale and will expense such costs as cost of manufacturing revenue at the time of sale 
however  as we sell our existing inventory that was previously expensed  there will be a period of time in which the company will reflect minimum cost of manufacturing revenue since the majority of the cost of such inventory has already been expensed in prior periods as research and development expenses 
cost of manufacturing revenue for of approximately million reflects primarily fill and finish costs 
consistent with  we anticipate that our manufacturing revenue margin on sales of erbitux to our corporate partners will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter during we expect that during  we will experience certain quarters in which the cost of manufacturing revenue reflected in our operating expenses will primarily reflect costs associated with packaging  labeling and shipping inventory  for which all or a portion  have been previously expensed 
we also anticipate that there may be a reporting period in that may include a combination of partial cost  and full absorption cost of manufacturing revenue 
therefore  full absorption costs of manufacturing revenue will not be reflected on our income statement until such time as all previously expensed or partially expensed erbitux has been sold through to our partners for either commercial or clinical use 
based on our current expectations of purchases by our partners  we expect to begin to reflect full cost of manufacturing revenue during the third quarter of royalty expense royalty expense of  for the year ended december  consists of obligations related to certain licensing agreements related to erbitux 
approximately  of royalty expense is reimbursed by our corporate partners and included as collaborative agreement revenue for the year ended december  in january  we finalized and signed license agreements with genentech and centocor  inc for the rights to patents covering various aspects of antibody technology and certain use of epidermal growth factor receptor egfr antibodies 
for erbitux use in combination with anti neoplastic agents  imclone systems gross royalty expense for all licenses  including genentech  centocor  aventis and the university of california  is approximately percent of north american sales 
we receive reimbursements for a portion of these royalty expenses  resulting in a net royalty expense of approximately 
after the first quarter of  gross royalty expense will decrease to and net royalty expense will decrease to 
for erbitux monotherapy use  gross and net royalty expenses will be reduced by approximately because certain licenses are not applicable 
fourth quarter royalty expenses include charges of approximately million required to bring estimated royalty expenses recorded through the first nine months of in line with actual obligations 
royalty expenses in for erbitux will include approximately of us in market sales  as previously mentioned  approximately of us in market sales is reimbursed as a component of collaborative agreement revenue  resulting in a net royalty burden to imclone of 
litigation settlement in january  a number of complaints asserting claims under the federal securities laws against the company and certain of the company s directors and officers were filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
those actions were consolidated under the caption irvine v 
imclone systems incorporated 
the complaint generally alleged that various public statements made by or on behalf of the company or the other defendants during and early regarding the prospects for fda approval of erbitux were false or misleading when made  that the individual defendants were allegedly aware of material non public information regarding the actual prospects for erbitux at the time that they engaged in transactions in the company s common stock and that members of the purported stockholder class suffered damages when the market price of the company s common stock declined following disclosure of the information that allegedly had not been previously disclosed 
on january   and continuing thereafter  nine separate purported shareholder derivative actions were filed against members of the company s board of directors  certain of the company s present and former officers  and the company  as nominal defendant  advancing claims based on allegations similar to the allegations in the federal securities class action complaints 
on january   we reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated class action described above for a cash payment of million  a portion of which will be paid by our insurers 
the settlement is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive settlement documents and to court approval 
the company anticipates that a hearing to consider approval of the settlement will be held in late april or early may we also reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated derivative action described above 
under the settlement  the company will be paid million by its insurers  which the company intends to contribute toward the settlement of the irvine securities class action described above after deducting amounts awarded by the court in the derivative action for plaintiffs attorney s fees and expenses in that action  which the company has agreed not to oppose in an amount up to  the proposed settlement is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive settlement documents  the approval and consummation of the settlement of the irvine class action and court approval 
as a result  we have recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at december  as litigation settlement  a liability of million and a receivable from our insurers of approximately million  included in other current assets 
net expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as litigation settlement 
recovery write down of withholding taxes the amount for the year december  of  consists of the reversal of a liability related to withholding taxes that was settled at an amount less than was originally estimated 
the recovery in the comparable period of of  is due to a recovery of a previous write down related to a withholding tax matter attributable to a former executive of the company 
interest income and interest expense interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with  in the comparable period in  an increase of  this increase is attributable to the increase in the company s cash and cash equivalents and our securities portfolio primarily as a result of the receipt of  in march of and the  of convertible debt issued in may interest expense was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the fact that the company s cost of borrowing decreased with the issuance of million of convertible debt in may of  compared to the million of convertible debt outstanding in the comparable period of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  amounted to approximately which is lower than the amount previously indicated in our third quarter filing 
the primary reason for the decline in the effective rate is due to the fact that the company was able to utilize approximately million of net operating losses that were previously believed to be limited based on a previous analysis conducted under section of the internal revenue code of during the fourth quarter of  we hired an external firm to conduct a study under section in order to verify if we had any limitations under this section of the code 
based on the results of such study  we learned that we do not have a limitation under section  as previously believed 
therefore  we have utilized all available net operating losses in which has resulted in a lower actual effective rate than previously calculated in the third quarter of the effective tax rate in was also impacted by a million litigation settlement expense taken in the fourth quarter of the difference from the statutory rate of is due to the utilization of net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards and state taxes 
a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the single most important determinant in estimating our tax rate for is the assumption made with respect to the potential receipt of a million milestone payment during the calendar year 
if an assumption is made that the milestone is earned this year  we would expect our accounting tax rate to be approximately 
conversely  if no milestone is received  we would expect the effective tax rate to be in the low single digits 
net income loss we had net income of  or per basic common share and per diluted common share for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or per basic and diluted common share in the comparable period in the fluctuation in results was due to the factors noted above 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the comparable period in we derived our revenues from three primary sources license fees and milestone revenue  royalty revenue  and collaborative agreement revenue 
license fees and milestone revenue total license fees and milestone revenue in of  consist of recognition of up front payments received under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb of approximately  recognition of payments received under the development and license agreements with merck kgaa of  and license fees from glaxosmithkline plc 
glaxo of  the increase in license fees and milestone revenue from of  is due to an increase in revenue recognized under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb as a result of increased expenditures in product research and development during by bms and er squibb and imclone systems and the receipt of an additional payment of  from bms during royalty revenue royalty revenue consists primarily of royalty payments received from abbott pursuant to the licensing of some of our diagnostic products and techniques on a worldwide basis 
during we earned royalty payments of  primarily from abbott  a decrease of  from the corresponding period in the decrease is due to the fact that abbott discontinued the sales of these products during  therefore we expect that any royalties in the future will be minimal as they exhaust their existing inventory 
in addition  as a result of the approval by swissmedic in december of of erbitux in switzerland  we earned approximately  of royalty revenue on sales of erbitux by merck kgaa in switzerland during the month of december collaborative agreement revenue collaborative agreement revenue consists of reimbursements from our partners bms and merck kgaa under our collaborative agreements 
there are three primary categories for which we receive reimbursement from our partners clinical and regulatory expenses  the cost of erbitux supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies  and certain marketing and administrative expenses 
during  we earned  in collaborative agreement revenue of which  represents amounts earned from bms and er squibb and  represents amounts earned from merck kgaa as compared to  earned in of which  was earned from bms and er squibb and  was earned from merck kgaa 
the decrease in collaborative agreement revenue in of  is primarily due to a decrease in product supplied to merck kgaa during for use in clinical studies 
operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended december  amounted to  a decrease of  or from the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses of  a decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses of  a decrease of  due to a recovery of a previous write off in of  relating to a withholding tax liability and a decrease of  relating to expenses associated with the bms acquisition  stockholder and amended commercial agreements 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in clinical and regulatory expenses of  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in research and development expenses include costs associated with our in house and collaborative research programs  product and process development expenses  costs to manufacture erbitux and other product candidates prior to any approval that we may obtain of a product candidate for commercial sale and quality assurance and quality control costs 
research and development reflect costs that are reimbursable from our corporate partners 
approximately  and  of costs reflected in research and development for the years ended december  and  respectively  are reflected under collaborative agreement revenue since they represent inventory supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies 
with the approval of erbitux by the fda on february   our research and development expenses will no longer reflect prospectively from that date the cost associated with manufacturing erbitux 
costs incurred in the production of erbitux for sale to our corporate partners will be included in inventory and expensed as cost of goods sold at the time of sale of such inventory 
the decrease in research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately  related to cost incurred in connection with the manufacturing of erbitux by lonza  a contract manufacturer 
for the years ended and  research and development included approximately  and  respectively of inventory cost manufactured by lonza under a service agreement that was completed by june of this decrease was partially offset by increased expenditures in discovery research and increased costs associated with the full scale production of bb the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investment in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug or biological product to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of pre clinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct human clinical studies for drugs or biologics  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a nda for a drug product or a bla for a biological product to allow commercial distribution of the drug or biologic 
due to the inherent risks associated with candidate discovery and development  as well as the regulatory approval process  we  by necessity  manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a manner designed to generate new clinical candidates into development 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments assigned to any one program prior to the phase iii stage of development or the future cash inflows from these programs 
clinical and regulatory clinical and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in clinical and regulatory expenses consist of costs to conduct our clinical studies and associated regulatory activities 
the increase experienced in is primarily as a result of incremental costs incurred due to increased activity in our clinical programs including an increase of approximately  in salary and benefits based on increased headcount during approximately  and  of the costs included in this category for the years ended december  and  respectively is reflected as revenues under collaborative agreement since they represent costs that are reimbursable by our corporate partners 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses include marketing and administrative personnel costs  including related facility costs  additional costs to develop internal marketing and field operations capabilities  costs to pursue arrangements with strategic corporate partners and technology licensors  and expenses associated with applying for patent protection for our technology and products 
marketing  general and administrative expenses also include amounts reimbursable from our corporate partners 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  amounted to  a decrease of  or from the comparable period in this decrease is primarily due to a payment made in the second quarter of for separation compensation and other post employment benefits of  associated with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer 
in addition  during april  bms paid us  which represented the refund of a previously written off deposit related to the exclusive right to negotiate a long term supply agreement with lonza  which was recognized as a decrease to marketing  general and administrative expenses in this decrease was partially offset by a payment of  in related to an employment agreement with a former executive officer and an increase in marketing expenses of approximately  incurred in order to support our marketing efforts going forward 
recovery write down of withholding tax assets and industrial development revenue bonds tax expense in  we recognized the recovery of the previous write down of the withholding tax asset and the elimination of the withholding tax liability of  attributable to the exercise of warrants by our former general counsel  john b 
landes  because mr 
landes has represented to us that he has paid the taxes associated with this liability 
the write down of withholding tax assets in of  is primarily composed of the write down that was reversed in in april  the company discovered that we were in breach of certain covenants in our industrial development revenue bonds due may issued by the new york industrial development agency the ida bonds 
we recorded additional tax expense of  for the year ended december  and  of additional tax expense for during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a closing agreement with the internal revenue service in settlement of our federal income tax liabilities associated with the ida bonds for an amount less than previous estimates of federal tax liability 
as a result  the company has recognized a benefit of  attributable to the recovery of tax expense attributable to the ida bonds 
interest income and interest expense interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average monthly cash and cash equivalents balance and a decrease in interest rates associated with our portfolio of marketable securities 
interest expense was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in the overall decrease in interest expense from the year ended december  to was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized during the construction of bb in branchburg  new jersey  from  to  interest expense for both periods included interest on the convertible subordinated notes due march  the convertible subordinated notes issued in february  interest on the ida bonds with a principal amount of  which were redeemed on june   interest on financing our corporate insurance and interest recorded on various capital lease obligations under a financing agreement with finova technology finance  inc finova and with ge capital leasing 
we recorded gains on securities available for sale of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent net realized gains from the sale of investments in our available for sale securities portfolio  which as of december  amounted to  provision for income taxes income taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are the result of various tax law changes in the state of new jersey  one of which is the establishment of the alternative minimum assessment tax to which we are subject 
net losses we had a net loss to common stockholders of  or per share for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or per share for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss and net loss per share to common stockholders was due to the factors noted above 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale of approximately million 
historically  we have financed our operations through a variety of sources  most significantly through the issuance of public and private equity and convertible notes  license fees and milestone payments and reimbursements from our corporate partners 
since the approval of erbitux on february   we began to generate royalty revenue and manufacturing revenue from the commercial sale of erbitux by our corporate partners and generated income from operations in as we continue to generate income  our cash flows from operating activities is expected to increase as a source to fund our operations 
therefore  we anticipate that our future financial condition and our future operating performance will continue to experience significant changes and that past performance will not likely be indicative of our future performance 
summary of cash flows years ended december  variance thousands of dollars vs 
vs 
cash provided by used in operating activities     investing activities     financing activities      net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   historically our cash flows from operating activities have fluctuated significantly due to the nature of our operations and the timing of our cash receipts 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the comparable period of the change in net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to the receipt of a milestone payment of million from bms and er squibb on march  as a result of the fda s approval of erbitux and from income generated from royalties earned on the sale of erbitux by our corporate partners 
as we continue to earn revenues and operating income from the sale of erbitux in the future  we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to experience significant fluctuations from prior period results 
our primary sources and uses of cash under investing activities consist of purchases and sales activity in our investment portfolio  which we manage based on our liquidity needs  possible business development transactions and amounts used for capital expenditures 
during the year ended december   we used approximately million in investing activities as compared to the comparable period in  in which we generated million from investing activities  or a net increase of cash used in investing activities of approximately million 
the increase in cash used in investing activities is mainly due to an increase of approximately million in our investment portfolio and an increase in capital expenditures of approximately million from the corresponding period in primarily related to construction of our multiple product manufacturing facility 
during the second quarter of  we raised net cash of approximately million from the issuance of senior convertible notes 
the proceeds generated from the issuance of these securities will be strategically invested in our business  however until such time as we decide the most beneficial use of this cash  we will continue to invest the money in securities in accordance with our investment policy 
net cash flows provided by financing activities increased by approximately million during the year ended december   primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million received in may of from the issuance of senior convertible notes and an increase in cash from exercise of stock options 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and our cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to support our operations at least through the first quarter of we are also entitled to reimbursement for certain marketing  royalty expense  and research and development expenditures and certain other payments  some of which are payable contingent upon the achievement of research and development and regulatory milestones 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve these milestones 
our future working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to progress and cost of our research and development programs  pre clinical testing and clinical studies  the amount and timing of revenues earned from the commercial sale of erbitux  our corporate partners fulfilling their obligations to us  timing and cost of seeking and obtaining additional regulatory approvals  level of resources that we devote to the development of marketing and field operations capabilities  costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  and legal costs associated with the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and investigations  status of competition  and our ability to maintain existing corporate collaborations and establish new collaborative arrangements with other companies to provide funding to support these activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of us dollar denominated securities that may include us corporate debt  foreign corporate debt  us government debt  foreign government agency guaranteed debt and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities  commodities  foreign exchange contracts or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in investment grade fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we invest in securities that have a range of maturity dates 
typically  those with a short term maturity are fixed rate  highly liquid debt instruments and those with longer term maturities are highly liquid debt instruments with fixed interest rates or with periodic interest rate adjustments

interest on the securities is adjusted monthly  quarterly or semi annually  depending on the instrument  using prevailing interest rates 
these holdings are highly liquid and we consider the potential for loss of principal to be minimal 
our outstanding fixed rate convertible senior notes in the principal amount of  due may  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain restrictions as outlined in the indenture agreement 
the fair value of fixed interest rate instruments is affected by changes in interest rates and in the case of the convertible notes by changes in the price of our common stock as well 
the fair value of the convertible senior notes was approximately  at december
