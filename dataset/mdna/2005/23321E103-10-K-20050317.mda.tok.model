item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this form k 
general we are a manufacturer and provider of bullet and projectile resistant garments  and fragmentation protective vests  and related ballistic accessories  which are used domestically and internationally by military  law enforcement  security and corrections personnel  as well as governmental agencies 
we also manufacture and distribute protective athletic apparel and equipment  including a wide variety of knee  ankle  elbow  wrist and back supports and braces that assist serious athletes  weekend sports enthusiasts and general consumers in their respective sports and everyday activities 
we are organized as a holding company that currently conducts business through its subsidiaries through two divisions  the dhb armor group and the dhb sports group 
the armor group represented approximately  and of consolidated revenues of the company during  and  respectively 
the company s products are sold both nationally and internationally 
sales to the us military comprise the largest portion of the armor group s business  followed by sales to federal  state and local law enforcement agencies  including correctional facilities 
accordingly  any substantial increase or reduction in government spending or change in emphasis in defense and law enforcement programs could have a material effect on the armor group s business 
the sports group manufactures and markets a variety of sports medicine  protective gear  and health supports products under its own labels  private labels and house brands for major retailers 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of our products 
as indicated in the financial information included in this report  the company has experienced substantial increases in its revenues in the past several years  which has been attributable primarily to product demand from the us military and federal  state and local law enforcement 
the company s ability to maintain these revenue levels will be highly dependent on continued demand for body armor and projectile resistant clothing  and although the company does not foresee an immediate material reduction in such demand  there is no assurance that governmental agencies will not refocus their expenditures based on changed circumstances or otherwise 
due to its growth  the company has outgrown its small business status under government procurement regulations 
although the loss of our small business status makes us ineligible for certain set asides under government contracting regulations  we believe that our current size suggests our ability to manage larger orders and allows us to credibly bid on major procurement contracts under which small businesses would be our subcontractors 
the company s market share is highly dependent upon the quality of its products  and its ability to deliver its products in a prompt and timely fashion 
to meet projected demand  and to maintain its ability to deliver quality products in a timely manner  the company in april  moved into a new  expanded production facility in pompano beach  florida 
however  there is no assurance that  in the long term  demand for the company s products will remain at recent levels  or that the company will be able to diversify into alternate markets or alternate products  or to increase its market share through acquisitions of other businesses 
management s current strategic focus is on quality and delivery  which management believes are the key elements in obtaining additional and repeat orders under the company s existing procurement contracts with the us military and other governmental agencies

the sports group s revenues for the year ended december  increased to approximately million as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in the sports group s revenues was attributable to the addition of wal mart stores in canada to its customer base  the addition of a new chain of drug stores  long drugs stores  and an expanded number of products in target stores during the consolidated gross profit percentage for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in the gross profit percentage reflects a change in the product mix as well as the additional costs associated with increasing and expediting the company s sales orders to meet the accelerated demand of our customers  including overtime costs and freight and delivery charges 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales improved to of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the company incurred higher than normal selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  over the prior comparable period due to million in bonuses paid to key employees and executives to compensate them for their contribution to the success of the company 
these bonuses were approximately of revenues for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the company also retained an agent to expand its overseas opportunities  and paid a consulting fee of  research and development expenditures increased to approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior comparable year 
the primary reason for this increase is associated with the testing costs for the military  which increased with the significant volume increase from the military  and the addition of two new programs for testing verification of incoming raw materials and the development of new law enforcement techniques for a more in depth analysis of performance 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  included certain non recurring expenses  including sharply increased legal fees pertaining to the company s successful defense of a patent infringement suit  legal and professional fees associated with the union organizing campaign relating to the company s point blank body armor subsidiary  and  in non cash compensation charges for the issuance of stock warrants to an outside consultant 
operating income increased to approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million in the prior comparable period  driven primarily by increased sales volume along with the decrease in the percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating margins increased to in from in interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately million  an decrease from approximately million for the prior comparable period 
this decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates under the company s revolving credit facility and the repayment of the shareholder loan

also included in other income was the gain on the sale of approximately a interest in the company s point blank subsidiary

the company s operating subsidiaries sell the majority of their products on to day terms 
working capital is needed to finance the receivables  manufacturing process and inventory 
working capital at december  was approximately million as compared to working capital of approximately million at december  the accounts receivable days outstanding increased to days at december  as compared to days at december  as a result of higher receivables from state and local law enforcement which typically pay a little slower 
although the working capital of the company increased during  the cash used from operations increased to approximately million compared to cash provided from operations of approximately million during the main cause of the negative operating cash flow is the substantial growth the company has been experiencing 
the underlying drivers of operating cash flows are the inflows and outflows of funds 
inflows are principally cash collections from customers 
as a result of the company s continued and rapid growth  the company has been experiencing increases in its accounts receivable  thus causing cash inflows from operations to lag behind net sales 
cash collections from customers approximated million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to net sales of approximately million and million respectively  for the comparable years 
the outflows are principally manufacturing costs plus the buildup of the inventory to accommodate future growth 
therefore  the company s cash outflows related to manufacturing cost plus increasing inventory values outpaced the cost of goods sold 
cash outflows for manufacturing costs plus inventory buildup approximated million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to cost of goods sold of approximately million and million  respectively  for comparable years 
on march   the company amended its bank credit agreement the credit agreement  which increased the total borrowing limits from million to million at that time 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company may borrow  on a revolving basis  up to million on of eligible accounts receivable the credit facility  and the company borrowed a term loan in the principal amount of million repaying the million dollar term loan  amortizing at the rate of million per quarter commencing july this amended credit agreement will expire on october  on march   the company again amended the credit agreement  to increase the revolving credit borrowing limit to million and the company borrowed a term loan in the principal amount of million amortizing at the rate of million per quarter commencing july  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at the company s option  at the bank s prime rate at december  or libor at december  plus per annum on the credit facility and at the bank s prime rate or libor at december  plus on the term loan 
for  the borrowings bore interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus at december  
the borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by a first security interest in substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility includes both affirmative and negative covenants customary for a financing of this nature 
the credit facility among other things  requires the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth  as defined  fixed charge coverage ratio  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the credit facility has certain restrictive covenants that limit the company s ability to pay dividends to its common stockholders  repurchase treasury shares  and limits the total amount of capital expenditures to million during any given year 
the company does not anticipate capital expenditures to reach the million limit as described below 
these restrictive covenants require the company to obtain prior approval with the bank before paying common stock dividends or repurchasing treasury shares 
currently the credit facility has a prepayment penalty through october  the company believes that these restrictive covenants do not have a material impact on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
the company s capital expenditures in increased approximately million to approximately million as compared to approximately  during this increase is attributable to the additional machinery  equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements with the new warehouse and administrative facility in florida for the company s point blank subsidiary and a new location for the company s corporate headquarters 
during  the company currently anticipates spending approximately  in capital expenditures to construct a new state of the art ballistic testing range in its point blank s pompano beach facility in addition to our normal capital expenditures of approximately  for total anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company believes that its existing credit line  together with funds generated from operations  will be adequate to sustain its operations including projected capital expenditures through historically  the company has been successful in obtaining increases in its revolving credit facility  as required in order to finance the increased working capital needs brought on by the rapid and substantial expansion of the company s business 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain further such increases if needed  and the company may be required to explore other potential sources of financing including the issuance of equity securities and  subject to the consent of the company s lender  other debt financing if the company continues to experience escalating demand for its products 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
cash contractual obligations the following table presents the company s estimated cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt    employment contracts operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     critical accounting policies the company s management believes that its critical accounting policies include revenue recognition dhb recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned 
product revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred  written contract and sales terms are complete  customer acceptance has occurred and payment is reasonably assured 
returns are minimal and do not materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the carrying value of long lived assets and allowances for receivables and inventories 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on the first in  first out basis or market 
income taxes dhb uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
other investment dhb had a cost based investment in a non publicly traded company 
during  a decline in the value of this cost based investment below cost that was deemed other than temporary was charged to earnings  resulting in a loss on investment of  judgments and estimates underlying the company s accounting policies vary based on the nature of the judgment and estimate 
the company uses judgments and estimates in order to determine its allowance for doubtful accounts  which relates to the company s revenue critical accounting policy 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of the accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibles based on an evaluation of historic and anticipated trends  the financial condition of customers and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
the company also uses judgments and estimates to determine the valuation allowances on its deferred tax assets to establish reserves for income taxes  each of which relate to the company s income taxes critical accounting policy 
the company bases these estimates on projections of future earnings  effective tax rates and the impact of economic conditions 
these judgments and estimates are based upon empirical data as applied to present facts and circumstances 
judgments and estimates are susceptible to change because the projections that they are based upon do not always turn out to be correct or unanticipated issues arise that are not considered in the company s assumptions 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation number r consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r  which modifies certain provisions and effective dates of fin  sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment is a variable interest entity should be consolidated 
these provisions are based on the general premise that if a company controls another entity through interests other than voting interests  that company should consolidate the controlled entity 
the company believes that currently  it does not have any material arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity  which would require consolidation

special note regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are based on our current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions that speak as of the date hereof and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below  elsewhere in this form k and in other reports that we have filed with the securities and exchange commission 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements to reflect any change in the expectations of our management with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions  or circumstances on which any such statements are based 
risk factors our business  operations and financial condition are subject to various risks 
several material risks are described below  and you should take these risks and others set forth in this annual report on form k and in other reports and materials that we file with the securities and exchange commission into account in evaluating us or any investment decision involving us 
this section does not describe all risks applicable to us  our industry or our business  and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors 
our business is materially dependent upon raw materials that have been subject to shortages over the past two years 
a substantial majority of our revenues and net income is dependent upon the sale of the ballistic resistant products of our armor group 
the raw materials used by our armor group in the manufacturing of our ballistic resistant products include kevlar tm  twaron tm spectra tm and zylon tm and our primary shield products include goldflex tm  dyneema tm and spectra flex tm 
substantially all of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our ballistic resistant products consist of fabrics which are patented by major corporations which are purchased from four independent weaving or manufacturing companies 
accordingly  we have limited sources of such required raw materials for our ballistic resistant products 
during and  shortages of such required raw materials limited the quantity of products of our armor group that we could produce  and demand for such products exceeded that amount 
although we were able to partially mitigate the impact of these raw materials shortages by using a variety of ballistic fibers  instead of one type of fiber  the impact of the shortages was not completely eliminated because there are also limits on the availability of ballistic fiber blends 
in response to these shortages  we have adopted a policy of purchasing such materials based on their availability rather than our immediate need for such materials 
this policy is designed to mitigate the effects of any future shortages  however  it will also increase our inventory carrying costs 
further  notwithstanding our efforts to increase our inventory of required raw materials  if any of these manufacturers cease to produce these products or shortages persist or worsen  we may be required to use other fabrics in our ballistic resistant products 
in such event  we have no assurance that we would be able to identify alternate fabrics with comparable performance 
we expect any material future shortages of required raw materials to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the products we sell are inherently risky and could give rise to product liability and other claims for which we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the products that we manufacture are typically used in applications and situations that involve high levels of risk of personal injury 
failure to use our products for their intended purposes  failure to use them properly  their malfunction  or  in some limited circumstances  even correct use of our products  could result in serious bodily injury or death 
we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover the payment of any potential claim 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our current insurance or any other insurance coverage will continue to be available or  if available  that we will be able to obtain it at a reasonable cost 
our cost of obtaining insurance coverage has risen substantially since the terrorist attacks of september  any material uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is dependent on our u 
s military business and a loss or decrease in such business would have a material adverse effect on us 
our us military contracts account for a significant portion of our revenue 
the us military funds these contracts in annual increments 
these contracts require subsequent authorization and appropriation that may not occur or that may be greater than or less than the total amount of the contract 
changes in the us military budget  spending allocations and the timing of such spending could adversely affect our ability to receive future contracts 
none of our contracts with the us military has a minimum purchase commitment  and the us military generally has the right to cancel its contracts unilaterally without prior notice 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  us military business for ballistic resistant products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
many of our customers have fluctuating budgets  which may cause substantial fluctuations in our results of operations 
customers for our products include federal  state  municipalities  foreign  military  law enforcement and other governmental agencies 
government tax revenues and budgetary constraints  which fluctuate from time to time  can affect budgetary allocations for these customers 
many domestic and foreign government agencies have in the past experienced budget deficits that have led to decreased spending in defense  law enforcement and other military and security areas 
our results of operations may be subject to substantial period to period fluctuations because of these and other factors affecting military  law enforcement and other governmental spending 
a reduction of funding for federal  state  municipal  foreign and other governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on sales of our products and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  our sales have increased due to the us military operations in iraq and afghanistan 
we can provide no assurance that these increases will be maintained after the completion of those operations 
our business is subject to various laws and regulations favoring the us government s contractual position  and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 
as a contractor to the us government  we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of the federal government contracts that affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business 
these rules generally favor the us government s contractual position 
for example  these regulations and laws include provisions that subject contracts we have been awarded to protest or challenge by unsuccessful bidders and unilateral termination  reduction or modification by the us government 
the accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the us government under our contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the defense contract audit agency  an arm of the us department of defense 
responding to governmental audits  inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management s attention 
our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination  suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock has been subject to significant volatility and this trend may continue 
the general economic  political and stock market conditions that may affect the market prices of our common stock are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future 
the value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
factors affecting our market price include but are not limited to variations in our operating results  and whether we have achieved our key business targets  the limited number of shares of our common stock available for purchase or sale in the public markets  sales or purchases of large blocks of our stock  changes in  or our failure to meet  our earnings estimates  changes in securities analysts buy sell recommendations  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts and announcements of new contracts by us or our competitors 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
any such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
growth in our operations may strain our resources  and if we fail to successfully manage our growth  our business could be harmed 
the increase in orders for body armor for military personnel as well as the introduction of new products  is placing  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our operational  financial and managerial resources and personnel 
any failure to effectively manage growth could have material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
increases in the prices paid for raw materials may adversely effect our profit margins 
in the event we experience significant increases in the prices paid for our raw materials  we may be unable to completely pass through  either in whole or in part  such increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers 
in the event we are so unable to pass through all or a portion of such price increases to our customers  our profit margin on such products may be reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualtitative disclosures about market risk the company does not issue or invest in financial instruments or their derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to its borrowings under its million credit facility 
the company can borrow at either the prime rate of interest or libor plus 
any increase in these reference rates could adversely affect the company s interest expense 
the change in the interest rate for was immaterial 
the extent of market rate risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates is not quantifiable or predictable because of the volatility of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  given the small percentage change in the past  the company does not expect any changes in the interest rate to have a material effect on its operating results 
international transactions are predominately denominated in us dollars  mitigating any market risk resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the company does not have any material sales  purchases  assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and as such  is not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk
