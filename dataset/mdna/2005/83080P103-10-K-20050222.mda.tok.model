under performing assets residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are recorded at the loan s fair value by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of the collateral dependent loans is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the fair value of noncollateral dependent loans is determined by discounting expected future interest and principal payments at the loan s effective interest rate 
at december   impaired loans were  compared with  at december   the increase was due primarily to acquisitions 
non accrual loans are comprised principally of loans days past due as well as certain loans  which are current but where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the repayment terms 
interest previously accrued and not yet paid on non accrual loans is reversed or charged against the allowance for credit losses during the period in which the loan is placed in a non accrual status  except where sky financial has determined that such loans are adequately secured as to principal and interest 
interest earned thereafter is included in income only to the extent that it is received in cash 
in certain cases  interest received may be credited against principal outstanding under the cost recovery method 
non accrual loans increased from  at december  to  at year end the increase in non accrual loans in has resulted from the overall growth in the loan portfolio last year  including acquisitions 
for the year ended december   the amount of interest income that would have been recorded under the original loan terms for total loans classified as non accrual and restructured was  the amount actually collected and recorded  as interest income for these loans  was  at december    of loans secured by pools of commercial leases for which payment is over days past due are on non accrual 
these loans are guaranteed by surety bonds or insurance policies issued by three creditworthy insurance companies 
sky is engaged in litigation with these insurance companies to enforce their payment obligations  as are a number of other banks nationwide 
these non accrual loans are currently reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at the amount of the unpaid balance  under contractual terms 
after consultation with its counsel as to the strength of its position  sky financial believes that the credits are well secured and that the prospects for recovery of its unpaid balance is probable 
at december   non performing assets were  an increase from  at the prior year end 
the increase was primarily in non performing loans  which at year end  totaled  or of total loans outstanding  compared with  or  of total loans outstanding at year end other non performing assets increased due to the addition of  of non performing investments 
the non performing investments consist of two securities that are currently on non accrual  a franklin county  ohio revenue bond with a net outstanding balance of million and a pooled commercial loan package in partial default with a net outstanding balance of million 
loans now performing  but where some concerns exist as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms defined as loans rated substandard or worse  but excluding non accrual and restructured loans  approximated  and  at december  and  respectively  and are being closely monitored by management and the boards of directors of sky financial and its subsidiaries 
the classification of these loans  however  does not imply that management expects losses on each of these loans  but believes that a higher level of scrutiny is prudent under the circumstances 
the increase in loans where some concern exists is reflective of growth in the loan portfolio 
these loans require close monitoring despite the fact that they are performing according to their terms 
such classifications relate to specific concerns relating to each individual borrower and do not relate to any concentrated risk elements common to all loans in this group

all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
sky financial recognizes these credit risks as a necessary element of its business activity 
to assist in identifying and managing potential loan losses  sky financial maintains a loan review function that continuously evaluates individual credit relationships as well as overall loan portfolio conditions 
one of the primary objectives of this loan review function is to make recommendations to management as to both specific loss reserves and overall portfolio loss reserves 
the provision for credit losses for was  compared with  for and  in the change in the provision for credit losses was attributable to higher levels of net charge offs and growth in the loan portfolio 
the change in the provision for credit losses was attributable to improved asset quality  which was a function of the improving economy  partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio

table of contents sky financial maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans  loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
for residential real estate  installment  credit card and other loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on sky financial s historical loss experience and are reviewed for modification on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all criticized and classified loans  where management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that a loss has been incurred that exceeds the general allowance loss factor for those loans 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends  and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings

at year end  the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was  compared with  at year end the increase to the allowance in and was due primarily to the overall growth in total loans of and  respectively  and the adjustment of loss factors for components of certain segments within the loan portfolio 
the allowance allocated to the loans secured by pools of commercial leases and guaranteed by surety bonds or insurance policies increased in and due to the increase in loan balances to  in and  in from  in as a result of additional loans acquired from the mergers of second bancorp and metropolitan 
at year end  the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was  compared with  at year end and  at year end the increase in the allowance for was due primarily to the overall growth in the portfolio  which included the acquisition of three rivers  and the increase in non performing loans  which included the transfer to non accrual of  of loans secured by pools of commercial leases and guaranteed by surety bonds or insurance policies

the portfolio yield is maximized once these criteria are satisfied 
in recent years  the portfolio has shifted to include a greater percentage of mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities offer monthly principal and interest and may be used as collateral in a variety of financial transactions to secure sources of whole sale funding 
the market for agency mortgage backed securities is large and liquid 
it is the practice of sky financial to purchase mortgage backed securities with average expected lives of two to five years 
because this type of security may extend or contract  a pre purchase analysis is completed 
most securities purchased have structures that limit changes to duration as market rates change

the available for sale investment portfolio along with wholesale funding and interest rate derivatives ie interest rate swaps  caps and floors provides the company with the ability to manage liquidity and interest rate risk as the broader balance sheet and market conditions warrant 
from time to time adjustments in holdings of various types of investments may be necessary to maintain prudent positioning of the total balance sheet 
the management team through the asset liability committee reviews potential adjustments monthly 
a net gain of  was recognized on these sales 
securities sold totaling  were mortgage backed securities that had paid down significantly from the original purchase amount 
among the issues considered by management in the decision to sell mortgage backed securities that have paid down significantly included the market value of the investment  the current book yield  the remaining expected life of the investment  the cost of administration of the security  the stability of the expected remaining life and the likely reinvestment rate 
portfolio management is enhanced by maintaining the number of bonds in the portfolio to a reasonable number 
the sale of these securities resulted in a  net gain for the year 
in addition   of other investments consisting of equities and corporate debt issued by financial institutions and government sponsored enterprises were sold during the year at a net gain of  in addition to the securities sold above  an additional  in securities were sold during the integration of second bancorp into sky financial 
these investments were liquidated during the third quarter because they did not conform to the extension risk parameters of the broader securities portfolio 
a net gain of  was recognized on the sale of these assets due to changes in market interest rates between the merger date and the day each investment was sold

during   in securities were purchased  excluding portfolios acquired through the mergers with metropolitan and glb  while principal from maturities  calls and payments totaled  and sales totaled  the portfolio contains mortgage backed securities and  to a limited extent  other securities  that have uncertain cash flow characteristics 
the variable cash flows present additional risk to sky financial in the form of prepayment or extension risk primarily caused by changes in market interest rates 
this additional risk is generally rewarded in the form of higher yields 
sky financial utilizes a variety of tools to monitor and minimize this risk 
all securities must pass a stress test at the time of purchase estimating how the security would perform in various interest rate environments 
additionally  the corporate investment policy defines certain types of high risk securities ineligible for purchase  including securities that may not return full principal to sky financial 
it is also the practice of sky financial to minimize premiums paid on mortgage securities to avoid yield reduction if prepayments accelerate 
the total premium on mortgage securities was 
as of december compared to 
in december these policies help to ensure that there will be no material impact from these investments to the financial statements due to changes in market interest rates  which may shorten the average life of the portfolio 
expected maturities of individual securities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
mortgage backed securities are presented in the table based on current prepayment assumptions 
the weighted average yields on income from tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions have been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis

sky financial complies with sfas and sab in the determination of whether investment impairment is other than temporary 
each investment  which has an indicative market value less than the book value is reviewed on a monthly basis by management 
management considers at a minimum the following factors that  both individually or in combination  could indicate that the decline is other than temporary the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than book value  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  or the intent and ability of sky financial to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
among the factors that are considered in determining intent and ability is a review of capital adequacy  interest rate risk profile and liquidity at sky financial 
an impairment is recorded against individual securities if the review described above concludes that the decline in value is other than temporary 
the securities portfolio as of december  contains two investments that have been determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
both of the securities were acquired as part of the company s merger with metropolitan 
both securities were reduced in value as of their acquisition and a further discussion of these assets is contained in management s discussion of under performing assets

funding sources sky financial obtains its funding through a variety of sources 
retail deposits are gathered from individuals and businesses within the local communities served by the banking affiliate 
deposits encompass the full range of banking products including checking  savings and time deposits 
in addition  sky financial obtains funds under a number of borrowing arrangements 
the banking affiliate is a member of the federal home loan bank and may obtain both overnight and term advances 
the banking affiliate also obtains funds through securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds lines 
the parent company maintains a line of credit with a group of non affiliated banks

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments table presents  as of december   sky financial s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments 
deposits without a stated maturity have been placed in the one year and less category for this presentation based on the clients ability to withdraw on a daily basis 
however  from a practical standpoint  these deposits provide a stable long term source of funding 
table contractual obligations note one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total deposits without a stated maturity certificates of deposit federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements debt and fhlb borrowings junior subordinated debentures sky financial obtains its funding from a variety of sources including retail and commercial deposits  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  and debt securities offered by sky financial 
by utilizing a mixture of these funding sources  sky financial is able to manage its contractual repayment dates 
sky financial also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required to either receive cash or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the contracts are primarily interest rate swaps and cash is settled quarterly 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the table above 
a schedule of significant off balance sheet commitments at december   is included in table table significant commitments commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit letters of credit these commitments are extended to clients in the normal course of business and are subject to the same credit policies as making on balance commitments 
because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total amounts do not represent future cash flow requirements 
liquidity management management of liquidity is of continuing importance to the banking industry 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows of deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
to meet the needs of the clients and manage the risk of the bank  financial institutions have developed innovative ways to meet clients needs while at the same time manage both liquidity and interest rate risk 
this is being done primarily through liquidity management and the balance of deposit growth and alternative sources of borrowing 
certificates of deposit provide sky financial with a dependable source of funding 
however  market pricing can be highly competitive and this source of funds must be prudently managed 
as of december   a total of  of time deposits would mature in the next twelve months 
the maturities are reasonably disbursed across the year and there are no unusual concentrations of individual clients 
at sky financial  time deposit maturities are monitored through the corporate asset liability committee alco 
maturing balances are summarized by month  original term and existing rate within each of the eight regional market areas 
heavy maturity periods are monitored closely and proactive marketing plans are created that address both the client and sky financial s needs and preferences 
regional management along with funds management meets weekly to discuss general economic and market conditions 
during this meeting  each region reports the results of the prior week s pricing and promotional efforts 
each region then determines its rates for the coming week 
regional pricing allows sky financial to attract deposits at the most efficient cost available 
retained time deposits are monitored and the percent retained is reported monthly to alco 
management of sky financial is confident that a significant portion of the scheduled maturities will be retained in in the unlikely event that these are not retained by sky financial  a minimum liquidity ratio has been established at of non collateralized liabilities 
this ratio consists of readily marketable securities and unused borrowing capacity 
at least of the assets must be in unencumbered marketable assets 
in addition  sky financial has a standing contingent liquidity management plan that prioritizes the steps needed to compensate for temporary disruptions in liquidity 
in addition to maintaining a stable core deposit base  sky financial s banking subsidiary maintains adequate liquidity primarily through the use of investment securities  unused borrowing capacity  security repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased

the banking subsidiary is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the fhlb provides a reliable source of funds with a wide variety of terms and structures 
as of december   the banking subsidiary had total credit availability with the fhlb of  of which   was outstanding 
as of january  the credit availability at the fhlb will increase by approximately  due to the positive outcome of a collateral review conducted by the fhlb 
as of the end of  sky financial had announced its intention to acquire belmont bancorp 
as part of this transaction  if approved by belmont shareholders and regulators  sky would be obligated to pay approximately  in cash to complete the transaction 
in addition  sky has announced a share repurchase program for up to two million shares 
based upon december  closing price  approximately  would be needed to buy the maximum number of shares 
as of december   the parent company had  in cash available 
this amount  along with current dividend availability from the banking affiliate plus anticipated earnings for  would appear adequate to meet these demands 
sky financial is a holding company and does not conduct operations 
its primary sources of liquidity are borrowings from outside sources and dividends received from its subsidiaries 
for the banking subsidiary  regulatory approval is required in order to pay dividends in excess of the subsidiary s earnings retained for the current year plus retained net profits for the prior two years 
at december    was available for distribution to sky financial as dividends without prior regulatory approval 
sky financial maintains a  line of credit with a group of unaffiliated banks that expires may  it is anticipated that the line will be renewed 
as of december   sky financial had no outstanding balance on the line of credit 
the corporation manages liquidity risk in accordance with established policies primarily through the alco 
management has increased its monitoring of liquidity levels and has implemented strategies to increase liquidity 
strategies implemented over include new retail  deposit retention and growth initiatives  an increased portfolio of a laddered maturity of brokered cds and additional federal funds lines 
capital resources shareholders equity at year end totaled  compared to  at december   an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to net retained earnings net income less dividends of  and the issuance of stock for the acquisitions of second bancorp and prospect 
the federal reserve board has established risk based capital guidelines that must be observed by financial holding companies and banks 
sky financial has consistently maintained the regulatory capital ratios of the corporation and its bank above well capitalized requirements 
under capital adequacy guidelines  sky financial and sky bank must meet specific quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as determined under regulatory accounting practices 
sky financial s and sky bank s capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
management believes  as of december   sky financial and sky bank meet all capital adequacy requirements for which they are subject 
at december   sky financial s and sky bank s ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets as defined by the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action were and 
the capital position is managed through changes to balance sheet size and composition  issuance of debt and equity instruments  treasury stock activities  dividend policies and retention of earnings 
sky financial s strategic plans include continued growth through acquisitions  which can potentially impact sky financial s capital position 
sky financial may issue additional common stock in conjunction with future acquisitions in order maintain its well capitalized status 
in september  sky financial s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
during sky financial repurchased shares under the current authorization and in expects to repurchase the remaining shares authorized 
in  sky financial repurchased shares under a previous authorization 
shares repurchased by sky financial were used in its stock option plans and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   sky financial has  of capital securities with wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  which are considered to be tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
under the current federal reserve board s regulatory framework  certain capital securities offered by wholly owned uncon solidated trust preferred entities of sky financial are included as tier i regulatory capital 
the federal reserve board is currently evaluating whether these capital securities continue as tier i capital as a result of deconsolidating the related trust preferred entities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals 
if the federal reserve board disallows the capital securities as tier i regulatory capital  the effect of such a change could have a material impact on sky financial s regulatory ratios 
market risk management market risk is the risk that a financial institution s earnings and capital  or its ability to meet its business objectives  will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  credit spreads and or commodity prices 
within sky financial  the dominant market risk exposure is changes in interest rates 
the negative effect of this exposure is felt through the net interest spread  mortgage banking revenues and the market values of various assets and liabilities 
sky financial manages market risk through its alco at both the subsidiary and consolidated levels 
the committee assesses interest rate risk exposure through three primary measurements rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities or gap ratios  interest rate shock simulations of net interest income at risk and economic value of equity risk simulation 
sky financial also utilizes interest rate swaps and caps to effectively modify its liability interest rate repricing to more effectively match the repricing characteristics of its assets 
at december   the fair value of sky financial s derivative arrangements aggregated  on contracts with notional amounts of  sky financial monitors and manages its rate sensitivity position to maximize net interest income  while minimizing the risk due to changes in interest rates 
one method sky financial uses to manage its interest rate risk is a rate sensitivity gap analysis 
the difference between a financial institution s interest rate sensitive assets ie assets that will mature or reprice within a specific time period and interest rate sensitive liabilities ie liabilities that will mature or reprice within the same time period is commonly referred to as its interest rate sensitivity gap or gap 
an institution having more interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities within a given time 
table of contents period is said to have a positive gap  which generally means that if interest rates increase  a company s net interest income will increase and if interest rates decrease  its net interest income will decrease 
an institution having more interest rate sensitive liabilities than interest rate assets within a given time period is said to have a negative gap  which generally means that if interest rates increase  a company s net interest income will decrease and if interest rates decrease  its net interest income will increase 
the current policy imposes limits at the six month and month time periods that is measured in terms of the ratio of cumulative rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities 
table presents the gap position of sky financial at december  and table gap position year end year end alco guidelines max min six month one year the interest rate shock simulation analysis measures the potential effect on earnings that an instantaneous parallel change in general interest rates could have on net interest income and economic value of equity 
sky financial applies hypothetical interest rate shocks up  and basis points and down basis points to its financial instruments based on the assumed cash flows 
under the current interest rate environment  a declining basis point or greater scenario is improbable and therefore provide no meaningful results 
the economic value of equity measures the price risk of the entire balance sheet by discounting expected cash flows of all assets and liabilities and netting the result 
this provides a longer term view of the interest rate risk profile of the company that is focused on the current economic value of assets and liabilities that make up the balance sheet at a static point in time 
the shock then examines how the economic value of the company would change if market rates were different 
as demonstrated in table  as of december   the projected volatility of net interest income and economic value of equity due to the hypothetical changes in market rates are within alco guidelines 
as a result of being in a historically low rate environment  sky financial is monitoring the effect of a basis point up scenario 
a policy limit for a basis point up scenario has not been proposed by management as of december  table rate shock analysis year end year end alco guidelines one year net interest income change basis points n a basis points basis points basis points net present value of equity change basis points n a basis points basis points basis points the preceding analysis is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve  loan prepayments and reactions of depositors to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual or future results 
further  the analysis does not necessarily contemplate all actions sky financial may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of sky financial are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not necessarily move with the same velocity or within the same period  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require that sky financial measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars 
pending acquisition on december   sky financial announced an agreement to acquire belmont bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary  belmont national bank  a million commercial bank 
under the terms of the agreement  shareholders of belmont will receive cash  shares of sky financial  or a combination thereof  based upon an election process to occur prior to closing 
cash consideration is valued at per belmont share and stock consideration is fixed at an exchange ratio of shares of sky financial for each share of belmont 
the agreement further provides that  in the aggregate  of the belmont shares will be exchanged for sky financial common stock  with the remainder of belmont shares exchanged for cash 
the transaction is valued at million  based upon sky financial s closing stock price as of december  and is expected to close in the second quarter of the exchange is expected to qualify as a tax free transaction to the belmont bancorp shareholders 
following the merger  and upon the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals  belmont national bank will be merged with and into sky bank 
not considering the merger related charges discussed below  the merger is expected to be accretive to diluted earnings per share for the year due to the expected cost savings benefits achieved through the integration of systems and support functions  improved financial center efficiencies and increased alternative delivery channels for financial products and services 
however  due to the second quarter completion date for the merger and the relative size to sky financial  the accretive impact to diluted earnings per share is expected to be less than 
per share in as a result of cost savings efforts  sky financial expects to reduce approximately of belmont bancorp s non interest expense or million on an annual basis and  during after the completion of the merger 
after tax merger related charges of approximately  or approximately 
per diluted share are expected to be recognized in the second quarter of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation dollars and shares in thousands  except per share data critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of sky financial are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
accounting and reporting policies for the allowance for credit losses and mortgage servicing rights are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments 
application of assumptions different from those used by management could result in material changes in sky financial s financial position or results of operations 
account allowance for credit losses balance sheet reference allowance for credit losses income statement reference provision for credit losses description the allowance for credit losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in existing loans taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and current economic conditions that affect the borrower s ability to pay 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective due to the aforementioned reasons 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectibility of the loan is unlikely 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
allowances established to provide for losses under commitments to extend credit  or recourse provisions under loan sales agreements or servicing agreements are classified with other liabilities 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the loan contract 
residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are recorded at the loan s fair value by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of collateral dependent loans is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the fair value of noncollateral dependent loans is determined by discounting expected future interest and principal payments at the loan s effective interest rate 
sky financial maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance  which represent estimations done pursuant to either standard of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
many factors are considered when these grades are assigned to individual loans such as current and past delinquency  financial statements of the borrower  current net realizable value of collateral and the general economic environment and specific economic trends affecting the portfolio 
for residential real estate  installment  credit card and other loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on sky financial s historical loss experience and are reviewed for modification on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all criticized and classified loans  where management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that a loss has been incurred that exceeds the general allowance loss factor for those loans 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings 
management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
account mortgage servicing rights balance sheet reference other assets income statement reference mortgage banking income description the cost of mortgage loans sold or securitized is allocated between the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans based on the relative fair values of each 
the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is determined by using a discounted cash flow model  which estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio based on various factors  such as servicing costs  expected prepayment speeds and discount rates  about which management must make assumptions based on future expectations 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
management periodically evaluates mortgage servicing rights for impairment by stratifying the loans in the servicing portfolio primarily based on loan type  interest rate and region of origination 
impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of each stratum  taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based upon current industry expectations 
an impairment allowance for a stratum is recorded when  and in an amount which  its fair value is less than its carrying value 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is subject to prepayment risk 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in our servicing portfolio will not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
moreover  because most loans within our servicing portfolio do not contain penalty provisions for early payoff  we will not receive a corresponding economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than expected 
mortgage servicing rights represent the discounted present value of the future net cash flows we expect to receive from our servicing portfolio
