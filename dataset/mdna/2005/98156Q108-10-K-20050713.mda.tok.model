in addition  revenues from our licensing and direct sale of consumer products  including through our catalogs  magazines and internet sites  may vary from period to period depending on the volume and extent of licensing agreements and marketing and promotion programs entered into during any particular period of time  as well as the commercial success of the media exposure of our characters and brand 
the timing of these events as well as the continued introduction of new product offerings and revenue generating outlets can and will cause fluctuation in quarterly revenues and earnings 
inflation during the past three fiscal years  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
application of critical accounting policies accounting policies we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements  as well as the significant judgments and estimates affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition pay per view programming revenues from our pay per view programming are recorded when the event is aired and are based upon our initial estimate of the number of buys achieved 
this initial estimate is based on preliminary buy information received from our pay per view distributors 
final reconciliation of the pay per view buys occurs within one year and any subsequent adjustments to the buys are recognized on a cash basis 
as of april   our pay per view accounts receivable was million 
if our initial estimate is incorrect  it can result in significant adjustments to revenues in subsequent years 
television advertising revenues from the sale of television advertising are recorded when the commercial airs within our programming and are based upon contractual amounts previously established with our advertisers 
these contractual amounts are typically based on the advertisement reaching a desired number of viewers 
if an ad does not reach the desired number of viewers  we record an estimated reserve to reflect rebates or additional ad placements due to advertisers  based on the difference between the intended delivery as contracted and actual delivery of audiences 
as of april   our estimated reserve was million 
if our estimated reserves are incorrect  revenues in subsequent periods would be impacted 
sponsorships through our sponsorship packages  we offer advertisers a full range of our promotional vehicles  including television  internet and print advertising  arena signage  on air announcements and special appearances by our superstars 
we follow the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and assign the total sponsorship revenues to the various elements contained within a sponsorship package based on their relative fair value 
our relative fair values for the sponsorship elements are based upon a combination of historical prices and current advertising market conditions 
revenue from these packages is recognized as each element is delivered 
if we do not accurately estimate the fair values of the various components of sponsorship packages  the timing of our income recognition would be impacted 
sponsorship revenues totaled million in fiscal home video revenues from the sales of home video titles are recorded when shipped by our distributor to wholesalers retailers  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
the allowance for estimated returns is based on historical information and current industry trends 
as of april   our home video returns allowance was million 
if we do not accurately predict returns  we may have to adjust revenues in future periods 
magazine publishing publishing newsstand revenues are recorded when shipped by our distributor to wholesalers retailers  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
we estimate the allowance for newsstand returns based upon our review of historical return rates and the expected performance of our current titles in relation to prior issue return rates 
as of april   our newsstand returns allowance was million 
if we do not accurately predict returns  we may have to adjust revenues in future periods 
feature films we capitalize costs of production and acquisition  including production overhead  as feature film production assets 
these costs will be amortized to direct operating expenses in accordance with statement of position accounting by producers or distributors of films 
these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized film costs or estimated fair value 
these costs for an individual film will be amortized and participation and residual costs will be accrued in the proportion that current year s revenues bear to management s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the year expected to be recognized from exploitation  exhibition or sale of such film over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of initial release 
management regularly reviews and revises  when necessary  its ultimate revenue and cost estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value 
no assurance can be given that unfavorable changes to revenue and cost estimates will not occur  which may result in significant write downs affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
we have performed an initial estimate of our ultimate revenue for our two projects in post production  the marine and see no evil  and believe no write down is required at this time 
allowance for doubtful accounts our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that we estimate to be uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding and the financial condition of individual customers 
changes in the financial condition of significant customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional allowances that may be required 
as of april  our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as such  we recognize the future impact of the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities

we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when management does not believe the future tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
we also provide reserves when we believe that it is not probable that a tax position taken by the company will be sustained if challenged

that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amended the compliance dates of sfas no 
r to require the implementation no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company plans to adopt this statement in fiscal the impact of this statement will depend on the number of stock options we issue during fiscal  if any  but we do not currently expect the impact to be material

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate  interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our results of operations 
our foreign currency exchange rate risk is minimized by maintaining minimal net assets and liabilities in currencies other than our functional currency 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolio 
our debt primarily consists of the mortgage related to our corporate headquarters  which has an annual interest rate of 
due to the recent decreases in mortgage rates  this debt is now at a rate in excess of market  however due to the terms of our agreement we are prohibited from refinancing for several years 
the impact of the decrease in mortgage rates is considered immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income mutual funds and united states treasury notes  with a strong emphasis placed on preservation of capital 
in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  our investment portfolio s dollar weighted duration is approximately one year 
due to the nature of our investments and our strategy to minimize market and interest rate risk  we believe that our portfolio would not be materially impacted by adverse fluctuations in interest rates
