nearly three quarters of the decline in cobra s two way radio sales was due to a decline in units sold  mirroring the overall market trends in the category 
the remainder of the decline was due to continued declines in average selling prices  again reflecting market trends 
management believes that the industry decline in average selling price was offset somewhat by cobra s product mix and merchandising initiatives  including the introduction of longer range gmrs units and the use of value packs 
certain customers also contributed to the decline in two way radio sales

the above inflows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in intangible assets of million 
the increase in accounts payable reflected longer payment terms during for selected vendors 
accrued income taxes increased due to significantly increased income tax liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the increase in sales  offset in part by an overall reduction in the number of days sales outstanding 
the increase in intangible assets was due principally to new product software development expenditures for both mobile navigation and hand held gps devices  which are also expected to continue in and beyond 
the amortization of these assets is also expected to grow in future years 
working capital requirements are seasonal  with demand for working capital being higher later in the year as customers begin purchasing for the holiday selling season

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumption conditions 
the accounting policies and estimates that can have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment  except for revenue from sales of products to certain of those customers whose contractual terms specify fob destination 
revenue from sales of products to these customers is recognized at the estimated time of receipt by the customer estimated based on the average shipping time for all such customers  when title and risk of loss would pass to the customer 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described below 
sales returns reserve the company has a policy that allows its customers to return product that was returned to them by their customers 
the reserve reflects the sales  cost of sales and gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reducing accounts receivable and increasing inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any known changes in key variables affecting these return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding whether current return rates will approximate anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 
warranty reserve the company generally provides a one year consumer warranty for its products and also allows its customers to return product that has been returned by their customers 
consequently  the company maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical return rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales of that model and the unit standard cost of the model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in the estimate  as historical experience tells the company that most returns will occur within six months of the company s original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical returns rates and how the returned product will be disposed  either by liquidation or return to vendors for credit on new purchases 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal  either liquidation prices or the credit given by vendors 
liquidation reserve the company maintains a reserve representing the write down of returned product to net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for credit against similar  new models and depends upon the estimated future demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to vendor and  for the former  the liquidation prices expected to be received 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price or vendor credit per unit 

table of contents advertising and sales promotion accrual the reserve reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer by multiplying the customer s estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers from quarter to quarter 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of their planned program sales  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in the customer s programs 
adjustments may also be necessary periodically for unused customer funds 
deferred compensation obligations under the deferred compensation plans most of which are non qualified defined benefit plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in the determination of obligations under the plans and annual deferred compensation expenses include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company 
the rate is also dependent on rates used for qualified defined benefit plans 
the discount rate used approximates the fixed rate of return the company earns on the cash surrender value of an insurance policy purchased to fund payments to the retired president and ceo  which represented approximately half of the total obligation of the plans at december  this discount rate was in both and and in the compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future performance 
net realizable value reserve the company maintains a reserve to write down certain inventory  except for that covered by the liquidation reserve discussed above  below cost  as necessary 
the reserve includes models where it is determined that net realizable value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which slow moving  excess or non current models are to be included and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined will be sold below cost from quarter to quarter 
software related to products to be sold the company purchases and or incurs costs in connection with the development of software to be used in products that the company intends to sell 
such costs are capitalized and deferred as intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
such costs consist of expenditures incurred after technological feasibility of the software has been established and a working model of the product developed and consist principally of coding and related costs 
such costs are charged to earnings based on the ratio of actual product sales during the reporting period to expected product sales over the life of the product life cycle 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
see note to cobra s consolidated financial statements included under item  which is incorporated herein by reference  for a complete description of the company s significant accounting policies 
new accounting pronouncements on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out except for certain pre existing binding contracts of the existing extraterritorial income eti exclusion tax benefit for foreign sales which the world trade organization wto ruled was an illegal export subsidy 
the european union eu believes that the act fails to adequately repeal the illegal export subsidies because of the transitional provisions 
table of contents and has asked the wto to review whether these transitional provisions are in compliance with their prior ruling 
this will have no material impact on the company 
additionally  the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the impact on the company in the future will not be material 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  was issued 
fsp fas clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with statement as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment 
rather  the impact of this deduction would be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return beginning in as regulations are still pending  the company has not been able to quantify the impact  however  but believes that the impact will not be material 
on december   fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  was issued 
fsp provides companies additional time  beyond the financial reporting period during which the act took effect  to evaluate the act s impact on a company s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying statement fsp was effective upon issuance 
as of december   based on management s analysis of the act  although not yet finalized  it is unlikely that under the repatriation provision of the act the company had any foreign earnings to repatriate and accordingly  the financial statements do not reflect any provisions for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 
in november  the fasb issued statement  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses 
also  statement requires fixed overhead costs to be allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity 
normal production capacity includes a range of production levels 
it is the production an enterprise expects to achieve over a number of periods under normal circumstances  considering reductions in capacity from planned maintenance 
the company believes that its current accounting policies adhere to the specifications of statement in december  the fasb issued statement r share based payment 
this statement will require the company to recognize the fair value of granted options and shares as compensation cost over the service vesting period in its financial statements  beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period after june  accordingly  the company will reflect the adjustment to its earnings for the impact of this accounting pronouncement in the interim reporting period ending september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated principally with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company does not have any interest rate exposure at december   as there is no outstanding debt 
debt incurred is priced at interest rates that float with the market and therefore the fair value of the company s debt is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company s suppliers are located in foreign countries  principally in asia 
in  approximately of the company s sales were outside the united states  principally in europe and canada  compared to in the company minimizes its foreign currency exchange rate risk by conducting all of its transactions in us dollars  except for some of the billings of its european business  which are conducted in euros 
the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however forward contracts are occasionally used for hedging some euro denominated transactions for the company s european business 
please refer to note in the financial statements  which are incorporated herein 
table of contents by reference 
a movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate on the forward contracts outstanding at december  would result in approximately a  annual increase or decrease in cost of sales and cash flows
