overview we are one of the leading suppliers of secure personal identification systems 
we supply the issuance systems for the majority of driver licenses produced in the united states us and provide all or part of the issuance systems for national identifications  voter identifications  and driver licenses in more than international programs 
we estimate that our next closest competitor with regard to driver license issuance systems holds contracts with approximately driver license issuing authorities in the united states as of december  we are developing and marketing enhanced security for personal identification documents enabled by our proprietary digital watermarking technology 
we also are one of the leading providers of patented digital watermarking technologies that allow imperceptible digital codes to be embedded in all forms of media content  including personal identification documents  financial instruments  photographs  movies  music  and product packages 
the embedded codes within various types of media content can be detected and read by software or hardware detectors in personal computers and other digital processing devices 
we provide solutions based on this technology directly and through our licensees 
we believe we have the broadest intellectual property patent portfolio and commercial deployment of watermarking based applications amongst entities of which we are aware  including use of such intellectual property by more than four thousand enterprises and individuals 
our principal administrative  sales  marketing  support  research  development and engineering facility is currently located in beaverton  oregon 
our personal identification systems business is headquartered in burlington  massachusetts  with additional space in fort wayne  indiana for certain administrative and customer support functions 
the majority of our revenue comes from multi year contracts with government agencies  including us state departments of motor vehicles and central banks 
we intend to increase our revenue through increasing adoption of our products and services  marketing new digital watermarking applications  and licensing our intellectual property 
we expect to target  among other sources of revenue  government agencies  commercial printers  packaging companies  publishers  advertisers  proprietors of large image collections  and other producers of printed materials 
our aim is to license our technologies to those content producers so that they may embed our digital watermarks in their printed media  such as identification documents  magazine advertisements and articles  direct mail coupons  catalogs  stationery and envelopes  product packaging  labels and tags  trading cards  credit cards  and business cards 
our current and anticipated products are intended to enable content producers to control reproduction and alteration of their content  as well as to enable their printed materials to provide a link to relevant network services 
revenue from our new applications may include one time license fees  time based or volume based fees  subscription fees  royalties and revenue sharing arrangements 
we anticipate that the calculation of revenue and royalties for these new applications will be based at least in part on the size of the installed base of personal computers  cameras  scanners  digital image capture and output devices  and software carrying our patented reader technology  as well as the nature of the use of  and the nature and amount of licensed content carrying  our digital watermarks 
since inception  we have invested a significant portion of our resources and capital in attracting top senior management  in developing our products and technology  and in building our sales and marketing organizations 
we incurred significant losses from inception through the fiscal year ended december  and during  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we intend to continue to expend significant financial and management resources on developing additional products and services  improving sales and marketing activities  advancing our technologies and expanding our operations 
our revenue may not increase or even continue at its current levels and we may not maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
restatement of financial statements summary 
we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended december   and the quarterly periods ended march  and june  primarily as a result of certain errors in the capitalization of costs related to internal use software and project accounting cost tracking and cost deferrals at dids 
concurrently with this form k  we are filing our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended september   which we delayed filing as a result of the restatement 
we have not amended our annual report on form k or quarterly reports on form q for periods affected by the restatement  and the financial statements and any independent registered public accounting firm s report and related financial information for the affected periods contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
any disclosures that would be provided in any such amendments to our form k or form q for periods affected by the restatement would in large part repeat the disclosures contained in this report 
background 
on september  we announced that we were reviewing certain accounting practices and previously reported financial statements as a result of possible errors discovered by our management in the accounting for software development costs and project capitalization and other project cost capitalization accounting practices at our dids business unit 
on november   we announced that we were delaying the filing of our form q for the third quarter ended september  due to our ongoing evaluation of certain accounting issues relating to transactions entered into in prior periods 
during the course of our review  we determined that errors in the accounting for software development costs  project accounting  revenue recognition  and tax accruals among other areas with respect to certain prior periods had been made and required adjustment 
we have restated our consolidated financial statements to correct these errors 
we identified these errors as a result of our review of our accounting and our review of our internal control over financial reporting in preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and its implementing regulations 
in connection with our restatement  we identified and reported to our audit committee material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
please see item a below for a description of these matters and certain measures that we have implemented during and to date  as well as additional steps we plan to take to strengthen our controls 
effect of adjustments 
the key impacts of the restatement adjustments for each period affected by the restatement are to decrease net income from per share to a net loss of per share for the quarter ended march   decrease net income from per share to net income of per share for the quarter ended june   decrease net income from per share to net income of per share for the quarter ended september   increase net loss from per share to net loss of per share and decrease revenues by  for the quarter ended december  decrease net income from per share to net income of per share and decrease revenues by  for the year ended december   decrease net income from per share to a net loss of per share and increase revenues by  for the quarter ended march   and decrease net loss from per share to a net loss of per share and decrease revenues by  for the quarter ended june  description of adjustments 
capitalized software development costs 
we produce software that is used internally  and as such have costs that qualify under the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company s policy requires expensing of activities related to the preliminary stage of a software project such as the conceptual formulation of alternatives  allows capitalization of activities related to the application development stage of a software project such as coding  installation  and testing  and requires expensing of activities related to the post implementation stage such as training  maintenance  and support 
under these rules we capitalize costs in the application development stage of a software project 
in connection with the restatement  we determined that certain costs had been erroneously capitalized because either a portion of such costs did not qualify for capitalization eg  costs related to the preliminary or post implementation stages or the project itself did not qualify as internal use software eg  costs related to a non software project 
project accounting cost tracking and cost deferrals 
we erroneously tracked costs for various projects as a result of certain difficulties we had implementing a new accounting system in late and early as a result  certain costs that should have been recognized as expenses in the period incurred were erroneously recorded as inventory or as fixed assets 
tax accrual timing 
we identified certain international tax expenses that had not been properly accrued in the period incurred 
revenue accrual based on estimated production 
we recognize revenue on long term identification and driver license production contracts using a price per card method 
we use actual monthly volume amounts  if available 
otherwise  we estimate the card production volume on a monthly basis for certain of these contracts in order to recognize revenue earned during the period 
in the case of estimates  prior to publicly reporting results  our practice is to compare the actual production volumes to estimated production volumes and adjust revenue amounts as necessary 
however  for the first and second quarters of  this practice was not followed and  as a result  we understated revenues during the first quarter of and overstated revenues for the second quarter of other adjustments 
a number of other adjustments were made in the restatement  including adjustments to i correctly record inventory receipts in the proper period  ii correct the timing of revenue recognized for a maintenance contract  iii correct commission liability relating to a long term card product contract  iv correct vat payables and expenses  v correct revenue recognized on a milestone based contract to match revenue recognized when the milestones were completed  and vi correct intercompany allocations which were not properly recorded 
while the amounts associated with these other adjustments are relatively small  we believe that it is appropriate to record them as part of this restatement 
the decrease in net income relates primarily to the errors in software capitalization and project accounting 
these errors were partially offset by the net impact of income taxes and other adjustments 
the following tables set forth the restatement adjustments to our financial statements for december  the amounts in the tables are expressed in thousands 
the restated quarterly periods are contained in note of our consolidated financial statements included herewith

although revenue increased as a result of international revenues reaching the revenue recognition phase for a number of large domestic contracts  gross margins decreased because of voter identification projects delivered during  which typically have lower margins  as well as the initial deployment of several large domestic contracts that came on line in  which typically have smaller margins in the earlier years of the contract as compared to the later  extension years of the contract 
in the domestic market  we competed effectively  gaining extensions and upgrades from a number of customers and increasing our overall market share on a card production basis  including long term contracts with substantial upgrades in iowa and wyoming  and contract term extensions in indiana  virginia  georgia  and minnesota 
we also received new contract awards in minnesota and ohio in connection with competitive bidding processes 
the contract in ohio had previously been the contract of one of our competitors 
in florida  we started live central issue production in july  generating new revenue for dids  and were poised at year end to pilot the florida over the counter system for hundreds of sites 
we also recieved short term extensions in west virginia and hawaii  but those contracts have or will be transitioned to other providers 
in foreign markets  we continued to deliver consumable supplies on ongoing projects such as the uk and russian driver license programs  as well as a number of other  smaller projects 
we grew our revenue by closing a million order to build a system to produce a driver license system for latvia  started production of such system  and initiated production of the mexican voter identification card 
digital watermarking strategy on track  new and enhanced products developed our digital watermarking business consists of two prongs digital watermarking solutions that we provide directly to customers  and intellectual property licensing that enables other companies to provide watermarking solutions to their customers while paying patent and technology license fees to digimarc 
revenue for the watermarking business was up million or compared to the prior year driven by increased acceptance of our watermarking technologies 
the current digimarc solutions business consists of an anti counterfeiting system  imagebridge  mypicturemarc and idmarc product lines 
we have developed the anti counterfeiting system for a consortium of central banks  which has  and continues to  account for a substantial majority of our digital watermarking revenue 
imagebridge provides image asset tracking and identification to enterprise and stock photo agencies 
mypicturemarc provides copyright protection services to creative professionals 
idmarc  a security enhancement for driver licenses  is the latest addition to our digital watermarking mix providing cross jurisdictional authentication of identity documents such as driver licenses 
idmarc is offered to systems integrators and document issuers on a per document fee basis 
in some cases during early market development these fees may be discounted in exchange for accelerated market adoption 
our intent is to minimize barriers to adoption and encourage broad based deployment of the technology  and then monetize the embedded feature in a variety of aftermarket applications  including dmv and border crossing identity verification  law enforcement  airport security  and point of sale document authentication applications 
after successfully proving the model in driver licenses  we intend to license similar embedding and reading applications in the broader secure personal identification document market 
encouraging signs of industry wide adoption of digital watermarking in entertainment licensing of our digital watermarking patents is a critical element of our long term shareholder value proposition 
the greatest near term interest in digital watermarking is in the entertainment field 
digital watermarking is increasingly being employed for tracking and monitoring of music  movies  and television programs 
the majority of the major music labels are using digital watermarking solutions for forensic tracking of pre release music 
they are obtaining the tracking solutions directly from digimarc and from our licensees 
motion picture studios have begun following suit  using forensic tracking based on digital watermarking as part of increased piracy deterrence measures in the academy award screener program 
in the television business  three companies have licensed our patents either directly or through sublicenses and deployed monitoring systems to track radio and television programs and advertisements in major media markets around the world 
renewed interest in print to internet applications  fueled by innovation in mobile imaging certain other market developments are encouraging for our strategy as well 
the influx of imaging in mobile devices mainly cell phones and pdas is inspiring a renewed interest in digital watermarking as the means of linking printed materials to internet services that we launched in we believe that a highly supportive change in market dynamics is underway 
a number of companies  ranging from start ups to industry leaders like intel  microsoft  and ntt have announced initiatives aimed at using various signaling means  including bar codes  rfid  and digital watermarking to simplify the user interface for mobile device access to internet services 
looking ahead with the restatement behind us  the company anticipates strong revenue growth and improvement in supporting business and financial processes 
digital watermarking momentum is building in both commercial solutions and licensing businesses 
the broadening adoption of digital watermarking for pre release movies and music and by major us broadcasters for syndicated programming and promotions is very encouraging 
our newest digital watermarking product initiative is idmarc  a security enhancement for driver licenses that has been adopted by us states and one foreign country to date 
the us department of transportation has provided funding for pilot programs to demonstrate the utility of the embedded data in a number of transportation safety scenarios 
elsewhere in our secure personal identification business  the new system installations in florida  alabama  and ohio should fuel growth in us driver license issuance revenues 
while we may face competitive bids for a number of our major accounts in including california  texas  indiana  and georgia  there are also a number of opportunities for competitive wins in jurisdictions  such as arkansas  south carolina and ontario  canada 
the us legislative environment also is favorable to our growth as a result of increasing recognition of the broad security value of the driver license for america 
the global market for secure personal identification continues to take shape  providing numerous opportunities for continuing growth in international and channel sales for digimarc 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  warranties  investments  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition on long term service contracts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets  inventory valuation  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable  and contingencies and litigation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term service contracts we recognize revenue on long term identification and driver license production contracts using primarily a price per card method 
we use actual monthly volume amounts  if available  or we estimate the card production volume on a monthly basis for certain of these contracts in order to recognize revenue earned during the period 
in the case of estimates  when the actual production information becomes available  which is typically within four weeks  we bill the customer accordingly and any differences from the estimates are recognized in the month the billing occurs 
these amounts represent our best estimates of cards produced and are based on historical trends  known events during the period  and discussions with contract representatives 
prior to publicly reporting results  our practice is to compare the actual production volumes to estimated production volumes and adjust revenue amounts as necessary 
revisions to our estimates have been less than of total revenue in every period reported in  and since the lgp transaction 
any estimated amounts are included in unbilled receivables on the balance sheet until the actual production information is available and the billing occurs 
any estimation process involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to production estimation through our approval and monitoring processes related to accounting estimates 
revenue from professional services arrangements is generally determined based on time and material or a cost plus a profit margin measure 
revenue for professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided for in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
billing for services rendered generally occurs within one month following when the services are provided 
revenue earned which has not been invoiced is classified as unbilled trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets we periodically assess long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
if our estimates of projected future cash flows were too high by  we believe there would be no material impact on the reported value of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  we periodically review the useful lives of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life may have changed 
if the estimated useful lives of such assets do change  we adjust the depreciation or amortization period to a shorter or longer period  based on the circumstances identified 
inventory valuation inventory consists primarily of consumable supplies that are used in the production of driver licenses and products held for resale to customers 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value which lower amount is the net realizable value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and current information 
we review  and adjust when appropriate  our allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if our estimate of uncollectible accounts were too low by  there would be no material impact on the reported value of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies and litigation we periodically evaluate all pending or threatened contingencies or commitments  if any  that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position 
we assess the probability of an adverse outcome and determine if it is remote  reasonably possible or probable as defined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements  and the amount of the loss  or the range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated  then such loss is accrued and charged to operations 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of the conditions pursuant to sfas no 
are not met  but the probability of an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible  we will disclose the nature of the contingency and provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss  or state that such an estimate cannot be made 
results of operations during the year ended december   we invested in capital equipment and software development for several new programs  including programs based in florida  mexico  and alabama which caused our working capital to decrease for the period 
two of these three programs began to contribute revenue in the second half of and all of these programs are expected to be fully deployed in operating results were negatively impacted by lower margins resulting from sales mix  depreciation expense as a higher percentage of revenue  competitive bidding  inventory reserves  and lower yields on new products as well as charges for sarbanes oxley compliance  increased spending on our restatement activities  litigation settlement charges  and impairment charges 
the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended december  restated revenue service product and subscription total revenue cost of revenue service product and subscription total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research  development and engineering general and administrative restructuring charges  net total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense other total other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and revenue for was up from the prior year 
this resulted from an increase of million in id systems revenue  going from million in to million in  and an increase of million in watermarking revenue  going from million in to million in revenue related to services  which include the issuance of driver licenses  increased by approximately while revenue related to product and subscription sales increased approximately because of delivery of a large  international film based system to a customer  the sale of equipment to a domestic customer  and the license and related revenues for intellectual property rights to international customers 
operating expenses in total increased by million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the majority of the increase came from the general and administrative function as a result of several factors 
one such factor is the cost related to the restatement activities we are undertaking  which include legal  accounting  and consulting fees 
a second factor is the increased cost of our efforts to document  evaluate  and test our internal controls in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act of we also had increased costs related to impairment charges  litigation settlement charges  increased bad debt expense  charges for vacating our old building  and increased costs related to higher financial staffing and consulting fees 
our sales and marketing and research  development  and engineering costs increased only slightly 
as of the end of  we increased the number of our full time employees by and increased the number of our contractors by since the end of the increased workforce resulted from the high demand of delivery programs during the year and increased resources for our finance group 
we had a net loss of million compared to our net income of  in the decrease in net income came as a result of a decrease in margins of million and an increase in operating expenses of million  as described above 
based on projected driver license production volumes and other commitments we have for the periods under contract with our respective customers  including driver license issuing authority customers  we anticipate our current contracts as of december  to generate more than million in revenue during the life of such contracts  currently expected to be up to eight years 
we consider as backlog production volumes reasonably expected to be achieved under currently existing contractual terms  government orders that are firm but not yet funded  and government contracts awarded but not yet signed 
however  there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period  because our backlog includes contracts that extend for several years  during which time they could be cancelled or suspended 
anticipated revenues from long term contracts may cover periods as long as eight years  and in many instances such contracts may be terminated by the customer throughout the period 
we may never realize revenue on contracts included in our backlog or the timing of such recognition may change because the contract could be reduced  modified  or terminated early or the project schedule could be changed 
revenue total revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase in total revenue resulted primarily from an increase in our product and subscription revenues 
in international markets  where we provide driver licenses  national identification  and voter identification systems  services  and components in partnership with local card producers  security printers  system integrators  and others  we may serve as prime contractor or sub contractor  depending on the circumstances 
as a sub contractor  we are responsible for delivering hardware  software  or consumables to the prime contractor and  as a prime contractor  we are responsible for integrating the components of the system to the customer s specifications 
in international markets  revenue from international customers was million and million for and  respectively 
international sales for us have typically taken the form of an outright sale of equipment and or consumables to international government agencies or their prime contractors 
these sales often can be large  one time events 
due to the nature of the international customers  the timing of these sales is somewhat less predictable than in the context of service revenues provided to us by domestic customers and  consequently  international sales can occur unevenly during the course of a year 
we believe that international growth opportunities exist for us and we expect to continue to invest in personnel and resources to support our potential revenue growth outside of the united states 
we had no customer that accounted for more than of our revenue in  or service 
service revenue consists primarily of card production on a price per card basis  software development services and hardware and software maintenance 
the majority of service revenue arrangements are typically structured as price per card product agreements  time and materials consulting agreements  or fixed price consulting agreements 
service revenue is an umbrella category consisting of both service revenue and contract based service revenue 
the distinction between these two subcategories is that service revenue is generated from long term identification and driver license production contracts  while contract based service revenue is generated from other long term  time and materials service contracts 
service revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was the result of increased issuance revenue from program transitions the addition of programs based in mexico  florida  and latvia offset by the loss of programs based in oklahoma  alaska and maryland  in addition to increased services provided under our long term contract with the international consortium of central banks 
product and subscription 
product and subscription revenue consists primarily of the sale of equipment and consumables related to identification card production systems  software license sales  and subscriptions related to the imagebridge product 
product and subscription revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was primarily related to the delivery of a large  international film based system to a customer  the sale of equipment to a domestic customer  and the license and related revenues for intellectual property rights to international customers 
prices for product and subscription offerings by the company are generally consistent with prior periods 
cost of revenue service 
cost of service revenue primarily includes compensation for software developers  quality assurance personnel  product managers  field operations personnel  and business development personnel  outside contractors  costs of consumables used in delivering a service  depreciation charges for machinery used specifically for service delivery  amortization of capitalized internal use software costs  and travel costs directly attributable to service and development contracts 
cost of service revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was primarily the result of increased international operations costs of million  an increase of program related depreciation costs of million  and an increase of million in domestic field operations costs  and inventory and program asset charges of million related to excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory  partially offset by a decrease of million related to costs of consumables related to issuances 
we have begun to outsource much of our field operations and maintenance activities on new contracts to third parties  and therefore the increase in spending is not the result of the increase in the total number of our full time employees during we have been active in negotiating volume discounts  decreasing storage costs  and consolidating operations when necessary among other actions 
field operations employees totaled and at december  and  respectively 
product and subscription 
cost of product and subscription revenue primarily includes compensation for operations personnel  costs of consumables sold to third parties  costs of machinery sold to third parties  internet service provider connectivity charges and image search data fees to support the services offered to our subscription customers 
cost of product and subscription revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was primarily the result of increased material costs in connection with the delivery of the large international film based system to one customer during the year ended december  this large delivery had particularly low margins 
we also sold quantities of older or expiring film and equipment to a domestic customer at low margins or no margin during the year which drove up costs and reduced margins for the period 
gross profit overall gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the million or decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily related to the following factors inventory and program asset charges of million related to excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory  increased international operations costs of million related to the ramp up of two large new programs  increased domestic field operations costs of million  an unfavorable revenue mix during the first half of the year  including low margin revenues from follow on film sales into an international voter identification project and some domestic equipment sales  cost overruns related to the sale of a driver license issuance system in the first half of the year  and higher depreciation charges of million originating from the capitalized costs related to hardware  software  and delivery activities in the deployment of new contracts and upgrades to existing contracts 
these items were partially offset by a decrease of million related to costs on consumables related to issuances 
in particular  the high level of new programs  while indicative of our continuing marketing successes and anticipated to be a precursor to significant growth in revenues  exerted operational pressures on our identification systems business during the year as the organization incurred higher expenses as part of the upfront implementation costs associated with making these new programs operational 
we believe that these operational pressures on our identification systems business will likely continue for the next few quarters  resulting in continued margin pressures as we continue to incur significant expenses without corresponding revenue increases  until the new programs are fully implemented and producing revenues in timing and amount that offset such increased expenses in connection with their implementation 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of sales and marketing personnel  product managers and sales engineers  as well as recruiting  travel  market research  and costs associated with marketing programs  such as trade shows  public relations and new product launches 
sales and marketing expenses were million for each of the years ended december  and the spending remained relatively flat for the year due primarily to lower headcount for sales and marketing employees and spending controls offset by increased impairment charges of approximately million related to investments in private  technology related companies 
starting in  we reduced many of the overhead and variable costs within sales and marketing by consciously making strategic spending decisions 
these efforts have resulted in targeted spending for critical areas  yielding lower overall spending within the function 
sales and marketing employees totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest at or slightly above the current run rate in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of software developers and quality assurance personnel and payments to outside contractors 
research  development and engineering expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall increase in research  development and engineering expenses of million or resulted from higher headcounts  partially offset by cost control measures taken by us during the previous and current year  such as restructuring the business  consolidating operations  centralizing certain services  and standardizing products 
research  development and engineering personnel totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest at the current run rate in product research  development and engineering for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of executive  finance and administrative personnel  facilities costs  legal  human resources and other professional fees  and depreciation and amortization expense  including intangibles 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses of million or primarily resulted from incremental third party legal and accounting costs related to our restatement activities of million  incremental costs related to third party services in support of our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of of million  incremental charges related to the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and uncollectible notes receivable of million  incremental charges related to the settlement of litigation of million  incremental facility costs of million due to dual rent costs for four months in addition to increased amortization and depreciation on the facility build out  offset by a decrease by million in amortization charges related to intangible assets compared to the prior year 
the remaining million of the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of increases in headcount  consulting fees and other general costs related to compliance and administrative activities 
in addition  we added headcount and consulting resources to our infrastructure  including our finance and information technology groups  in order to meet the normal responsibilities of these functions in addition to the increased demands of our restatement and ongoing compliance activities 
general and administrative employees totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
we expect general and administrative expenses will remain at increased levels in future periods primarily due to the legal and other professional fees related to the foregoing matters  as well as the recently filed shareholder derivative lawsuits  and the anticipated higher insurance costs and increased accounting  audit and legal fees related to our compliance with section we also expect such expenses to increase in future quarters because we anticipate that we will continue to invest in our finance and information technologies organizations and the operational infrastructure at our identification systems business 
amortization of intangible assets 
we account for intangible assets resulting from acquisitions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement nos 
 business combinations and  goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements require the recording of intangible assets under purchase accounting rules  and require the amortization of such intangible assets over their expected useful life 
as a result  in december we recorded million of intangible assets related to the acquisition of certain assets and certain liabilities from polaroid and affiliates 
these intangible assets were set up to amortize over a year period  representing the expected useful life 
changes in contract status and customer relationships may lengthen or shorten the expected useful life of such intangible assets  or cause an impairment charge related to the intangible asset  so some variability is expected to exist related to intangibles depending on internal and external factors 
amortization of intangible assets is included in general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations 
the estimated amortization of intangibles over the next five years is as follows amortization of intangibles stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements 
stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock on the date of grant  and is being recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  usually four years 
no stock based compensation expense was recorded in while million was recorded for the year ended december   and is included in the respective statements of operations expense categories for the employees to which it applies  as set forth in the table below

digimarc is currently assessing the impact of adopting statement no 
r to its consolidated results of operations 
on december   the audit  compensation and corporate governance committees of the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of vesting of the company s outstanding stock options with option exercise prices greater than 
the acceleration applies to all options outstanding under the company s restated stock incentive plan and non officer employee stock incentive plan that would not have otherwise vested in full by june  in accordance with their terms 
the effective date of the vesting acceleration is december  the company has disclosed the value associated with these options in the pro forma net income calculation for the year ended december  included in note to the company s financial statements 
the exercise price was selected because it was higher than i the price at which the company s stock had traded during the period prior to the announcement of the restatement of prior financial results  ii the average trading price of the company s common stock for the last two years  and iii the purchase price per share of the company s common stock in the company s private placement in august options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  or of the total number of options of the company outstanding as of december  with remaining vesting schedules  were accelerated 
accelerating the vesting of the company s options prior to the time at which these new accounting changes become effective accelerates the recognition of any remaining expense associated with these options 
no additional compensation expense was recorded in the statement of operations as the options that were accelerated had an exercise price greater than the fair market value of the shares underlying the options on the date of the modification

under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including a change of more than in ownership 
such a change in ownership occurred with the sales of preferred stock in june  july  and july and in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in december accordingly  we estimate that approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards are subject to the utilization limitation

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments of million  representing a decrease of million from million at december  as of december   million of cash and cash equivalents is restricted as a result of the requirements of performance bonds that we are obligated to maintain in connection with some of our long term contracts in our personal identification systems business 
we support the performance bonds with letters of credit  which may or may not require restricted cash 
due to the losses incurred through the second quarter and the losses that were expected for the year at that time  we were required to increase our restricted cash during the fourth quarter 
the letters of credit must be renewed yearly if they are expected to continue  and therefore the need for restricted cash is renewed yearly 
however  our banks have required us to restrict this cash until we return to profitability for one year 
accordingly  restricted cash is classified as a non current asset 
working capital at december  was million  compared to working capital of million at december  the majority of the decrease in cash and working capital primarily relates to investments made in the new florida  mexico  and alabama programs that we anticipate will contribute to revenue growth in and beyond

in august we sold  units  each of which consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  to sixteen institutional and accredited investors  in a private placement transaction that resulted in million of net proceeds to the company and million related to the issuance of common stock through the employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
commitments and contingencies 
our significant commitments consist of obligations under non cancelable operating leases  which totaled million as of december   and are payable in monthly installments through october our obligations under non cancelable capital leases  which totaled million as of december   are payable in monthly installments through we are contractually obligated to make the following payments as of december  known contractual obligations payment due by period in s less than more than total year years years years capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations we have driver license contracts with various states that are not yet fully deployed for which we have estimated the amounts to complete 
in order to complete these contracts  we estimate we will incur approximately million of expenditures 
the estimates are derived from information known to the company at the time the estimates were prepared 
actual expenditures may vary from our estimates 
the majority of the expenditures will occur in the first half of  and none are expected to be incurred in these expenditures are recouped through receipts from the long term price per card agreements 
our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures may constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we expect that we will continue to utilize cash in the upcoming few quarters as we complete our program implementations in florida  alabama and ohio and build inventory levels for these programs and the mexico program as such programs reach full production 
we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
customers have asserted  and may in the future assert  compensatory or liquidated damages  breach of contract  or other claims alleging that we have failed to meet timing or other delivery requirements and milestones pursuant to the terms of such contracts 
from time to time  customers have given notice of their intention to assert claims for liquidated damages 
for example  in the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of  customers provided notice that they may elect to assert liquidated damages under the terms of their respective contracts 
management believes that these assertions are part of the resolution process involving commercial disagreements over the delivery terms of these contracts 
such disputes are not uncommon and tend to be resolved over time 
to date  we have not paid liquidated damages in connection with a dispute with a domestic customer 
we recently elected to pay a minor amount in settlement of a liquidated damages claim in connection with our mexican contract 
while there is always risk that liquidated damages could be assessed in the future  management does not believe that it is probable that material amounts will be paid  nor can we predict what the amount of any such damages would be if they were to be imposed 
however  our failure to meet contractual milestones or other performance requirements as promised could result in our having to incur increased costs  lower margins  or compensatory obligations in addition to other losses  such as harm to our reputation 
such unexpected increases in costs to meet our contractual obligations or any other requirements necessary to address claims and damages with regard to our customer contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results  although prior assertions of such claims have not had such an effect 
we anticipate that future contracts will continue to have such provisions unless and until industry practices change 
future cash expectations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we anticipate continuing to use cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances to satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we have taken and continue to take steps to limit our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenues 
these steps include  among other things  considering and or taking steps  as needed  to restructure our business  consolidating our operations  negotiating volume pricing with vendors  centralizing certain services  and standardizing products 
we recognize that our operating expense levels  including research  development  engineering  selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  depend on anticipated business activity levels 
while research  development  engineering and marketing expenses are based on anticipated investment levels in technology development  product development and market development activities  the appropriate expense levels in selling  general and administrative expenses are dependent on the level of infrastructure required to support our anticipated business volume 
we review our business plans periodically to determine the appropriate level of such expenses based on various business factors 
in the past we have taken appropriate measures to control our expenses based on business circumstances 
in the future we will continue to review our business plans from time to time and make appropriate changes to our expense levels  as we have in the past  to reduce operating expenses where it is advantageous to do so to improve operational efficiencies 
in order to take advantage of opportunities  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity financing  debt financing  or credit facilities although we do not believe at this time that our long term working capital and capital expenditures will be of such a nature that we would be required to take steps presently to remedy any such potential deficiency 
as an example  in the event that we were to win contracts requiring significant capital investment  we may need to seek additional financing 
if it were necessary to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  we may not be able to do so  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of any interest expense we must pay with respect to outstanding debt instruments
