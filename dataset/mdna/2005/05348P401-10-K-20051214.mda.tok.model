when used in this report  the words intend  estimate  anticipate  believe  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to avanir are included to identify forward looking statements 
you should not rely on these forward looking statements  because they are only predictions based on our current expectations and assumptions 
many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements 
you should review carefully the factors identified in this report as set forth below and under the caption risk factors 
we disclaim any obligation to update or announce revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect actual events or developments 
except as otherwise indicted herein  all dates referred to in this report represent periods or dates fixed with reference to the calendar year  rather than our fiscal year ending september overview avanir pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutic products for the treatment of chronic diseases 
our product candidates address therapeutic markets that include the central nervous system  atherosclerosis  inflammatory diseases and infectious diseases 
we are currently developing neurodex for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect pba  also known as emotional lability  and for the treatment of chronic diabetic neuropathic pain 
we are in the process of finalizing the submission to the fda of our nda for neurodex tm for the treatment of pba 
additionally  in june we initiated a phase iii clinical trial of neurodex in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain 
our research and drug discovery programs are focused primarily on small molecules that can be taken orally as therapeutic treatments 
in fiscal  we formed new collaborative partnerships with two of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies to continue development of two of our pre clinical programs 
one development program for the treatment of atherosclerosis through the use of reverse cholesterol transport is partnered with astrazeneca uk limited 
another research program targeting macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif in the treatment of inflammatory diseases is partnered with novartis international 
table of contents pharmaceutical ltd 
using our proprietary xenerex technology  we are also conducting research to develop injectable human monoclonal antibody products for anthrax and other infectious diseases 
our first commercialized product  docosanol cream  sold as abreva by our marketing partner glaxosmithkline consumer healthcare in north america is the only over the counter treatment for cold sores that has been approved by the fda 
the following chart illustrates the approximate status of research activities for our products  product candidates and licensed technologies that are under development as of december  clinical preclinical activities graph we strive to maintain a lean organizational structure while working on a diverse product development pipeline 
we also strive to maintain flexibility in our cost structure by actively managing outsourced functions such as clinical trials  legal counsel  documentation and testing of internal controls  pre clinical development work  manufacturing  warehousing and distribution  rather than maintaining all of these functions in house 
we believe the benefits of outsourcing  being flexible and being able to rapidly respond to program delays or successes far outweigh the higher costs often associated with outsourcing 
if the neurodex nda is approved by the fda in  we intend to begin marketing and selling the product within several months of the fda s decision 
we are in the process of transforming from a research and development organization into a commercially viable pharmaceutical company 
in order to facilitate that transformation  we are starting to build the necessary infrastructure to support the planned commercial launch of neurodex if it is approved by the fda 
in preparation for the commercial launch of neurodex  we are in the process of developing our sales and marketing strategy and are recruiting sales and marketing personnel for key positions within the organization 
in march  we entered into an asset purchase agreement  pursuant to which our wholly owned subsidiary  avanir holding company  acquired from irisys  inc certain additional contractual rights to neurodex 
as a result  through our subsidiary we hold the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to neurodex 
table of contents for five indications under a royalty bearing license with the owner of the underlying technology  the center for neurologic study cns 
going forward  we will be obligated  if we achieve certain contingent events  to pay cns milestone payments  a patent royalty on product sales  and a share of revenues received if we sublicense neurodex to a third party 
we have no future financial obligations to irisys 
in the transaction  irisys was paid  in cash and received  shares of our class a common stock 
see note  related party transactions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we entered into collaborative license agreements with novartis and astrazeneca which  in the aggregate  represent the rights to receive up front payments totaling million and approximately million in potential milestone payments contingent upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
these milestones are expected to take several years of further development  including achievement of certain sales targets  when and if a licensed compound is approved for marketing by the fda 
in addition  we will be eligible to receive royalty payments  assuming the licensed compounds are successfully developed and approved for marketing by the fda  and we expect to receive research funding for providing research and development services under these collaborations 
novartis collaboration 
in april  we entered into the research  development and commercialization agreement with novartis for orally active small molecule therapeutics utilizing our novel mif technology as a potential treatment for inflammatory diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be eligible to receive an ongoing royalty and up to million in milestone payments  contingent on program progress 
additionally  we received an up front payment of million in may and we expect to receive research funding of between million and million per year for providing research and development services to novartis for two years from the date of the agreement  or longer upon mutual agreement of the parties 
astrazeneca collaboration 
in july  we entered into the licensing and research collaboration agreement with astrazeneca to discover  develop and commercialize reverse cholesterol transport enhancing compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be eligible to receive an ongoing royalty and up to million in milestone payments  contingent on program progress 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an up front payment of million in july and we expect to receive research funding of between million and million per year for providing research and development services to astrazeneca for up to three years 
we intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to help fund other research and development programs in exchange for sharing in the rights to commercialize new drugs 
in addition to the development of the mif and reverse cholesterol transport programs  we have licensed certain rights to docosanol cream 
we may also seek to develop other drug candidates through research collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies  allowing us to share the risks and the opportunities that come from such development efforts 
we expect that our selling  marketing  development and other operational costs will continue to exceed revenues from existing sources through at least fiscal trends in revenues and various types of expenses are discussed further in the results of operations 
we expect that we will have to raise additional capital to prepare for and execute a product launch of neurodex for pba  if approved by the fda for marketing  and to fund our ongoing clinical trials for neurodex for neuropathic pain  as well as selected research and other operating activities 
our future capital needs will depend substantially on our ability to reach predetermined milestones under our existing collaboration agreements  as well as the economic terms and the timing of any new partnerships or collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies under which they will share the costs of such activities 
if we are unable to raise capital as needed to fund our operations  or if we are unable to reach these milestones or enter into any such collaborative arrangements  then we may need to slow the rate of development of some of our programs or sell the rights to one or more of our drug candidates  and our commercialization plans for neurodex may be adversely affected

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical information and assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and circumstances that may impact us in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
our critical accounting policies regarding revenue recognition are in the following areas license and research contracts  royalty revenues  sale of rights to future royalties  grant revenues and product sales 
our critical accounting policies also include recognition of expenses in research contracts and research and development expenses and the valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin topic sab topic  revenue recognition and emerging issues task force no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
license and research and development service revenues 
our license and research and development service revenues are generated through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners and license agreements 
collaborative arrangements typically consist of non refundable and or exclusive technology access or data transfer fees  reimbursements for costs of specific research and development  and various milestone and future product royalty payments 
in accordance with eitf  we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting 
the evaluation is performed before entering into the agreement and at the inception of the arrangement 
the delivered item s is considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met a the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if the delivered item does not have standalone value or if we do not have objective or reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered component  the amount of revenue allocable to the delivered item is deferred 
nonrefundable  up front license or technology access fees with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under the arrangements are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations 
if we have continuing involvement through research and development collaborations or other contractual obligations  such up front fees are deferred and recognized over the collaboration period or the period for which we continue to have a performance obligation  unless all of the following criteria exist the delivered item s have standalone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and there is no general right to return the delivered item s 
payments related to substantive  performance based milestones are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreements  which represent the culmination of the earnings process 
revenue from research services is recognized during the period in which the services are performed and is based upon the number of fte personnel working on the specific project at the agreed upon rate 
payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until the research is performed  costs are incurred  or milestone is reached 

table of contents royalty revenues 
we recognize royalty revenues from licensed products when earned in accordance with the terms of the license agreements 
net sales figures used for calculating royalties include deductions for costs of unsaleable returns  managed care chargebacks  cash discounts  freight and warehousing  and miscellaneous write offs  which may vary over the course of the license agreement 
revenues from sale of royalty rights 
in agreements where we have sold our rights to future royalties under license agreements and we maintain continuing involvement in earning such royalties  we defer revenues and recognize them over the life of the license agreement 
for example  in the sale of an undivided interest of our abreva license agreement to drug royalty usa  revenue recognition is being determined under the units of revenue method 
under this method  the amount of deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue in each period is calculated by multiplying i the ratio of the royalty payments due to drug royalty usa for the period to the total remaining royalties that we expect glaxosmithkline will pay drug royalty usa over the term of the agreement  by ii the unamortized deferred revenue amount 
government research grant revenue 
we recognize revenues from federal research grants during the period in which the related expenditures are incurred 
product sales active pharmaceutical ingredient docosanol 
revenue from product sales  which consist of sales of our active pharmaceutical ingredient docosanol  is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria as described under sab topic are met  generally when title and risk of loss have passed to the buyer upon delivery 
we sell the active pharmaceutical ingredient docosanol to various licensees and ship only on written order for the materials 
total shipments generally occur fewer than five times a year 
our contracts for sales of the active pharmaceutical ingredient docosanol include buyer acceptance provisions that give our buyers the right of replacement if the delivered materials do not meet specified criteria  by giving notice within days after receipt of such defective materials  and we have the option to refund or replace such defective materials 
however  we have historically demonstrated that the materials shipped from the same pre inspected lot have consistently met the specified criteria and no buyer has rejected any of our shipments from the same pre inspected lot 
therefore  we recognize revenue from sales of the active pharmaceutical ingredient docosanol without providing for such contingency upon shipment 
recognition of expenses in outsourced contracts pursuant to management s assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize expenses as the services are provided 
such management assessments include  but are not limited to  an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally and or provided by the third party service provider  analysis of data that justifies the progress  and finally  management s judgment 
several of our contracts extend across multiple reporting periods  including our largest contract  representing an million phase iii clinical trial contract as of september  a variance in our estimate of the work completed in our largest contract could increase or decrease our operating expenses by research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
up front payments to collaborators made in exchange for the avoidance of potential future milestone and royalty payments on licensed technology are also charged to research and development expense when the drug is still in the development stage  has not been approved by the fda for commercialization and concurrently has no alternative uses 

table of contents we assess our obligations to make milestone payments that may become due under licensed or acquired technology to determine whether the payments should be expensed or capitalized 
we charge milestone payments to research and development expense when the technology is in the early stage of development and has no alternative uses  there is substantial uncertainty of the technology or product being successful  there will be difficulty in completing the remaining development  and there is substantial cost to complete the work 
acquired contractual rights 
payments to acquire contractual rights to a licensed technology or drug candidate are expensed as incurred when there is uncertainty in receiving future economic benefits from the acquired contractual rights 
we consider the future economic benefits from the acquired contractual rights to a drug candidate to be uncertain until such drug candidate is approved by the fda or when other significant risk factors are abated 
capitalization and valuation of long lived and intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives consist of capitalized legal costs incurred in connection with patents  patent applications pending and license agreements 
we amortize costs of approved patents  patent applications pending and license agreements over their estimated useful lives  or terms of the agreements  whichever are shorter 
for patents pending  we amortize the costs over the shorter of a period of twenty years from the date of filing the application or  if licensed  the term of the license agreement 
we re assess the useful lives of patents when they are issued  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the useful lives may have changed 
for patents  patent applications pending and trademarks that we abandon  we charge the remaining unamortized accumulated costs to expense 
intangible assets and long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the review indicates that intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable ie the carrying amount is less than the future projected undiscounted cash flows  their carrying amount would be reduced to fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of september   our largest group of intangible assets with finite lives was patents and patents pending for our selective cytokine inhibitor  consisting of intangible assets with a net carrying value of approximately million 
nature of operating expenses our operating expenses are influenced substantially by the amount of spending devoted to research and development 
during the past three years  we have substantially expanded our drug development pipeline  which requires that we allocate significant amounts of our resources to such programs  including increased spending on clinical trials as those programs advance in their development 
we expect research and development expenses will represent approximately to of our operating expenses for fiscal  compared to an average of for fiscal we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal will represent to of our operating expenses  compared to an average of for fiscal 
table of contents we attribute the expected increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a share of overall operating expenses in fiscal to be attributable to higher spending for medical education and marketing programs for neurodex and increased staffing  as we build our infrastructure for pharmaceutical operations  assuming the fda approves the new drug application for neurodex 
occupancy costs  including building rent  utilities  maintenance  operation of our laboratory and office facilities  insurance and depreciation  are allocated to the various departments based on headcount 
building rent amounted to approximately million in fiscal and has scheduled rent increases averaging approximately a year for at least the next three years 
our business is exposed to significant risks  as discussed in the section entitled risk factors  which may result in additional expenses  delays and lost opportunities that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales revenues and on operations has been minimal during the past three years 
results of operations we operate our business on the basis of a single reportable segment discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for chronic diseases 
our chief operating decision maker reviews our operating results on an aggregate basis and manages our operations as a single operating segment 
we have developed one commercial product  docosanol cream  also known as abreva in north america  and we have several other product candidates in various stages of development 
we have licensed docosanol cream to other companies in the world that market the product and provide us royalties on product sales 
we also have exclusively licensed our reverse cholesterol transport and mif programs to astrazeneca and novartis  respectively  which provide us with license fee and research funding revenues 
these license agreements accounted for substantially all of our revenues during the past three years 
the license agreements also provide future milestone payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones  which could take several years of further development  including achievement of certain sales targets as well as royalties on sales  when and if the products are approved for marketing by the fda 
we categorize revenues by geographic area based on selling location 
all our operations are currently located in the united states  therefore  total revenues for fiscal years ended september   and are attributed to the united states 
all long lived assets for fiscal years ended september  and are located in the united states 
comparison of fiscal and revenues vs 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to increases in license and research and development service revenues  partially offset by a decrease in product sales 
license revenues increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to license fees from the astrazeneca and novartis license agreements 
research and development service revenues in fiscal were also generated from the astrazeneca and novartis license agreements 
sales of docosanol decreased by  which is mainly due to an unusually large sale of docosanol to glaxosmithkline in fiscal revenue generating contracts 
revenue generating contracts that remained active as of september  include license agreements with novartis and astrazeneca  seven docosanol cream license agreements and one neurodex sublicense 
partnering  licensing and research collaborations have been  and will continue to be  an important part of our business development strategy 
we intend to partner with pharmaceutical companies that can help fund our research in exchange for sharing in the rights to commercialize new drugs resulting from this research 
we have licensed and continue to seek licensees in 
table of contents other countries for docosanol cream and other potential products in our development pipeline 
research collaborations also represent an important way to achieve our development goals  while sharing in the risks and the opportunities that come from such development efforts 
operating expenses vs 
total operating expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was due to a million or increase in research and development expenses and a million or increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
explanations of operating expenses in both fiscal and fiscal are described more fully in the paragraphs that follow 
operating expenses fiscal years ended september  operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative costs of product sales total operating expenses research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal r d spending in fiscal was related to the open label safety study of neurodex for the treatment of pba  preparation for and initiation of a phase iii clinical trial of neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain  and phase i clinical trials of our leading compound for the selective cytokine inhibitor program 
r d expenses also included pre clinical research related to the mif inhibitor  reverse cholesterol transport and antibobody development programs 
the increase in r d expenses is primarily due to million in expenses related to the acquisition of additional contractual rights to neurodex see note  related party transactions  in notes to consolidated financial statements  a million increase in spending for pre clinical development of our reverse cholesterol transport program and a million increase in spending related to initiation of a phase iii trial of neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
the increase is partially offset by decreases in pre clinical development  including a million decrease in our mif program and a  decrease in spending on our selective cytokine inhibitor program 
r d expenses in fiscal included the issuance of million in common stock in connection with the mif technology see note  summary of significant accounting policies research and development expenses  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following table sets forth the status of  and costs attributable to  our proprietary research and clinical development programs 
research and development projects and expenses inception estimated fiscal years ended september  through costs to september  complete projects company funded projects development programs for neurodex  selective cytokine inhibitor and other programs projected through fiscal     m to m partner funded projects preclinical atherosclerosis and mif inhibitor research programs funded by partners government funded projects preclinical research on various projects 
estimated timing to complete the current anthrax research project is less than months     m total each project includes an allocation of laboratory occupancy costs 
m refers to millions 
estimated costs and timing to complete the projects are subject to the availability of funds 
for each of the projects set forth in the table  other than neurodex for pba which we intend to market ourselves and the reverse cholesterol transport and the mif inhibitor programs which we have partnered  we may seek development partners or licensees to help defray part or all of the ongoing development costs 
inception dates are on or after october   at which time we began identifying and tracking program costs 
assumes completion of development of neurodex in the treatment of pba and for one phase iii clinical trial in the treatment of neuropathic pain  and continuation of studies of our selective cytokine inhibitor program 
projected spending thereafter will be subject to progress made in research that is currently underway 
we expect that increases in r d spending for neuropathic pain will offset the expected decline in spending related to pba in the coming years as we continue phase iii clinical trials of neurodex in the treatment of neuropathic pain 
r d spending on mif and reverse cholesterol transport programs are expected to be fully reimbursed by our collaborative partners 
we expect that spending on our selective cytokine inhibitor program and on development of monoclonal antibodies will depend in part on our strategy for partnering these programs  or in obtaining additional government grants  so that we are able to defray part or all of these ongoing development costs 
status of r d programs and plans company funded projects neurodex for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect emotional lability 
we plan to complete the submission of the neurodex nda to the fda in january assuming the drug is accepted by the fda for review  we expect the fda will take either six months or ten months from the submission date to complete its review of the nda  depending on whether it is a priority review or standard review  respectively 
we have 
table of contents been engaged in an open label safety study for the treatment of pba in a broad pool of patients who have pba associated with their underlying neurodegenerative disease or condition 
we expect to continue this open label study until we have a decision from the fda on approval of the drug for marketing  plus any additional time until launch  if approved 
in june  we successfully completed the treatment phase of a phase iii clinical trial of neurodex for the treatment of pba in patients with ms 
prior to engaging in these recent and current ongoing studies  we successfully completed the initial phase iii clinical trial of pba in patients with als in may neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
in june  we initiated our first phase iii clinical trial of neurodex in patients who have diabetic neuropathic pain and we are currently evaluating the balance of our development plan 
simultaneously  we are evaluating commercial development alternatives for this indication  including continuing development on our own including conducting a second phase iii clinical trial or co promotion licensing opportunities in which a partner would fund the second trial 
estimated timing to complete the first phase iii clinical trial and potentially partner this indication is up to two years 
there can be no assurances that we will choose or be able to negotiate a licensing and or co promotion arrangement for neurodex in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain on attractive terms  if at all 
development program for selective cytokine inhibitor 
in november  we completed a multi rising dose phase ib safety trial of avp and are currently in the process of evaluating the results of the study 
assuming the results of the multi rising dose study are favorable  we intend to proceed with proof of concept studies for the clinical indications to be explored 
in we completed the first phase i clinical trial of avp in healthy volunteers 
the placebo controlled study was intended to assess safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics following single rising oral doses 
results of the phase i study suggest avp was well tolerated at all single rising doses up through milligrams 
the study also demonstrated avp was detectable in the bloodstream at all doses administered and remains in circulation long enough to allow potentially once or twice daily dosing 
status of r d programs and plans partner funded projects anti inflammatory research program mif inhibitor 
in april  we entered into a research  development and commercialization agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
for orally active small molecule therapeutics utilizing our novel mif technology as a potential treatment for inflammatory diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be eligible to receive royalty payments  assuming the product is successfully developed and approved for marketing by the fda 
we are also eligible to receive up to million in milestone payments contingent upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones  which could take several years of further development  including achievement of certain sales targets  when and if a mif compound is approved for marketing by the fda 
additionally  we received an up front payment of million in may and will also receive research funding of between million and million per year for providing research and development services to novartis for two years from the date of the agreement  or longer upon mutual agreement of the parties 
while both parties to the agreement will contribute expertise and intellectual property to the research and development collaboration  novartis assumes responsibility for all development expenses 
in august  we entered into an amendment to the ciblex technology acquisition agreement initially signed in august for the mif inhibitor technology the ciblex amendment 
in connection with entering into the ciblex amendment  we issued ciblex  shares of class a common stock in lieu of potential future milestones that would have likely been due in the future under the technology acquisition agreement  assuming continued successful development 
the shares were valued at  and charged to r d expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note  shareholders equity common stock  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the ciblex amendment  we will no longer be obligated to make up to million in milestone payments to ciblex upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the clinical development and or commercialization of the mif inhibitor technology in the united states  nor will we be obligated to share milestone payments we receive from outside the united states 
we will be required to pay a royalty to ciblex if and when there are commercial sales of products utilizing the mif inhibitor technology 

table of contents development program for atherosclerosis 
consistent with our strategy of licensing our large research and development programs  in july we entered into an exclusive licensing and research collaboration agreement with astrazeneca to discover  develop and commercialize reverse cholesterol transport enhancing compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
under the terms of the agreement  we are eligible to receive royalty payments  assuming the product is successfully developed and approved for marketing by the fda 
we are also eligible to receive up to million in milestone payments contingent upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones  which could take several years of further development  including achievement of certain sales targets  when and if a licensed compound is approved for marketing by the fda 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an up front payment of million in july and will also receive research funding of between million and million per year for providing research and development services to astrazeneca for up to three years 
astrazeneca has the responsibility for overall development and for the development costs  with both parties contributing scientific expertise to the research collaboration 
status of r d programs and plans government funded projects government research grants have helped us fund research programs  including the development of antibodies to anthrax toxins and docosanol based formulations for the treatment of genital herpes 
subject to certain conditions  we  as the awardee organization  retain the principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed with the united states government support 
approximately  in aggregate funds remains to be spent in the remainder of and in under the government research grant related to development of antibodies to anthrax toxins 
our genital herpes project came to a formal end during the third quarter ended fiscal and we do not anticipate that we will perform any further work on that project 
we have no grant requests pending nor do we anticipate submitting in the future any grant requests for further research related to genital herpes 
monoclonal antibodies anthrax toxin 
two of our most potent anthrax antibodies  avp d and avp g  appear unique both in mechanism of action and in terms of the binding site on an anthrax toxin 
avp d is currently in preclinical development for use as a prophylactic and therapeutic drug to treat anthrax infections and is being funded by a two year  federal sbir research grant 
much of the work related to anthrax has been funded by government research grants  and our progress in this area will substantially depend on future grants 
because all of our monoclonal antibody research is at a very early preclinical stage of development and is unpredictable in terms of the outcome  we are unable to predict the cost and timing for development of any antibody or drug 
other government funded research 
during fiscal  we completed the development of a blood donor program intended to find high affinity antibodies to infectious diseases 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these increased expenses primarily relate to a million increase in expenses related to the continued expansion of our medical education and awareness programs for pba  market research  and pre launch planning activities for neurodex and hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  including a new senior vice president  sales and marketing  and a new senior director  marketing 
a million increase in professional services mainly associated with corporate governance and sec reporting  internal controls documentation and testing under the sarbanes oxley act of  a  increase in expenses related to increases in headcount and salaries in general and administrative areas  a  aggregate amount of severance expenses  including a  severance expense related to the resignation of our former ceo  and a  increase in recruiting and temporary labor expenses 
we expect that costs related to professional services mainly associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of will continue at the present level in the next fiscal year 
based on our current 
table of contents commercial development plans for neurodex for the treatment of pba  we expect sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will continue to increase 
interest income vs 
interest income increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a increase in average balance of investments in fiscal  compared to fiscal net loss vs 
net loss was million  or per share  in fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal a higher weighted average number of shares was outstanding in fiscal  which accounts for the lower loss per share 
we expect to continue to pursue our drug development strategy focused on the development of neurodex  followed by other programs in earlier stages of development that are in large therapeutic areas and that have significant partnering and licensing potential 
effective april  novartis assumed all responsibility for product development expenses for our mif technology 
effective july  astrazeneca assumed all responsibility for product development expenses for our reverse cholesterol transport program 
to help fund and develop our products  we may elect to license our other technologies and drug candidates to help offset the costs of development 
these potential license arrangements could materially change our outlook for future revenues and costs 
however  the timing of such potential arrangements is unpredictable 
comparison of fiscal and revenues vs 
revenues in fiscal amounted to million  including million from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to the sale of an undivided interest in our abreva license agreement to drug royalty usa see note  deferred revenue  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements   in sales of the active ingredient docosanol to licensees   from government research grants  and  from milestones and fees earned in license agreements 
revenues from government research grants included preclinical development of docosanol as a potential treatment for genital herpes  and preclinical research on a potential antibody to anthrax 
revenues for fiscal amounted to million  including million from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to the sale of an undivided interest in our abreva license agreement   from government research grants and  in docosanol product sales 
operating expenses vs 
total operating expenses amounted to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the million  or  increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by a million  or  increase in spending on research and development programs including a million charge in fiscal related to the issuance of common stock to the ciblex corporation  in lieu of potential future milestone payments related to our mif technology 
clinical development of neurodex for the treatment of pba remained the leading research and development program for fiscal  accounting for million or approximately of all research program spending 
we also incurred a million  or increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
research and development programs accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  which accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively  was primarily attributable to increases in legal  consulting  other costs associated with corporate governance and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and medical education and marketing activities related to neurodex 

table of contents research and development expenses 
r d expenses totaled million in fiscal  including the issuance of million in common stock in connection with the mif technology  compared to million in fiscal see note  summary of significant accounting policies research and development expenses  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
higher r d spending for fiscal  other than for the mif technology  was primarily related to clinical development of neurodex for the treatment of pba 
the neurodex program had a higher number of patients enrolled in both the phase iii clinical trial and the open label safety study in the treatment of pba in fiscal  which resulted in a million or increase over fiscal program spending 
costs associated primarily with phase i clinical trials of our selective cytokine inhibitor program accounted for of total r d spending in fiscal the balance of r d spending was for other programs  including pre clinical research related to the development of compounds for the treatment of inflammation and atherosclerosis and antibody research programs

selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal these increased expenses primarily related to a  increase in expenses related to the continued expansion of our medical education and awareness programs for pba  market research  and pre launch planning activities for neurodex 
a  increase related to human resources  employee training  and other company wide employee programs  a  increase related to legal and other professional services associated with corporate governance and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and a  increase in building occupancy costs  primarily resulting from the utilization of additional office space in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in outside services for investor relations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities  payments received under our collaboration agreements  government grants and interest income 
as of september   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in securities totaling million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  short and long term investments of million and restricted investments in securities of approximately  our net working capital balance as of september  was million

net cash used for operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash used for operating activities is mainly due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by an increase in net loss and an increase in receivables 
increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities reflect the expansion of our medical education and awareness programs for pba  market research  and pre launch activities for neurodex  assuming the drug is approved by the fda for marketing  and formulation and pre formulation work and clinical advisory services related to our potential products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  of which million represented an increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a corresponding increase in accounts payables and accrued expenses 
the increase in receivables is mainly due to a million increase in receivables from research and development services performed under the collaborative research agreements 
based on our current commercial development plans for neurodex for the treatment of pba  we expect sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will continue to increase 
we also expect to continue clinical development of neurodex in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain 
additionally  we expect to increase spending on preclinical research related to the development of compounds for the mif and reverse cholesterol transport programs in fiscal however  expenses for the mif and reverse cholesterol transport programs will be reimbursed by our collaborative partners 
net cash used for operating activities in fiscal was million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the net loss of million in fiscal  which reflects high levels of spending on our r d programs  combined with low revenues from existing sources  primarily accounted for the cash used for operating activities in that year 
depreciation and amortization of million in fiscal was  higher than in fiscal the additional depreciation in fiscal represents the full year effect of depreciation on million in tenant improvements on approximately  square feet of additional office and laboratory space that was completed in may in addition  the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal included million in cash  net of transaction costs  received from drug royalty usa from the sale of an undivided interest in our abreva license agreement with glaxosmithkline 
the sale of rights to future abreva royalties was initially recorded as deferred revenue on the date of sale see note  deferred revenue 
investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal our investments in securities were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments in securities 
capital expenditures related to patent costs were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal we invested  in leasehold improvements and equipment during fiscal  compared to  during fiscal we expect that capital expenditures for property and equipment will likely increase as we make modifications to improve office space utilization and to make accommodations in our existing facilities for additional sales and marketing personnel that will be necessary to support commercialization of neurodex  assuming the drug is approved by the fda

net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in the fiscal  consisting primarily of 
table of contents million received from the sale of our class a common stock and from issuance of notes payable totaling million 
in april  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec to sell an aggregate of up to million in class a common stock 
in june  we sold  shares of class a common stock at a price of per share for aggregate offering proceeds of million million net of underwriting discount and costs of the financing transaction

in june  we filed shelf registration statement on form s with the sec to sell an aggregate of up to million in class a common stock and preferred stock  depositary shares  debt securities and warrants 
this shelf registration statement was declared effective on august  subsequent to the year ended september   we sold  shares of class a common stock to certain institutional investors at per share for aggregate net offering proceeds of million 
see note  subsequent event  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   we have contractual obligations for long term debt  capital finance lease obligations and operating lease obligations  as summarized in the table that follows 
we anticipate being able to satisfy the obligations described below out of cash  cash equivalents and investments in securities held by the company as of september  and proceeds from additional sales of class a common stock under our june shelf registration statement see financing activities above and note  subsequent event  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations capital finance lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total in september  we entered into an equipment line of credit with ge healthcare financial services for financing of up to million 
as of september   the outstanding balance due under the line of credit was approximately  long term debt obligations represent monthly principal and interest payment obligations on the line of credit 
purchase obligations presented above represent contractual commitments entered into for goods and services in the normal of course of our business 
the amount includes all known contracts and open purchase orders that exceed  in the aggregate from any single vendor 
the purchase obligations do not include potential severance payment obligations to our executive officers in the event of a not for cause termination or change of control under their existing employment contracts 
for information regarding these severance and change in control benefits  refer to executive compensation 
in march  we entered into an asset purchase agreement  pursuant to which our wholly owned subsidiary  avanir holding company  acquired from irisys certain additional contractual rights to neurodex for  and  shares of class a common stock 
the fair value of the acquired assets was determined based on various financial models for the commercialization of neurodex for different indications  as well as the projected discounted cash flow and net present value under each such model 
the fair value of 
table of contents the common stock issued in the transaction was calculated at per share  or  in aggregate  using the day average closing price of our common stock  beginning two days before and ending two days after the close and announcement of the agreement on march  see note  related party transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
following this transaction  we hold  through our wholly owned subsidiary  the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to neurodex for certain indications as set forth under a license agreement with the center for neurologic study cns 
we will be obligated to pay cns milestone payments upon achievement of certain future events relating to the fda s regulatory approval process for neurodex and a royalty on commercial sales of neurodex  if and when the drug is approved by the fda for commercialization 
under certain circumstances  we may have the obligation to pay cns a share of net revenues received if we sublicense neurodex to a third party 
we expect to pay cns a  milestone in if the fda approves our nda 
management outlook we believe that cash  cash equivalents  and investments in securities of approximately million at december   plus anticipated future cash from licensed technologies  should be sufficient to sustain our planned level of operations for at least the next months 
during fiscal  we expect to earn million to million a quarter in revenues from r d services that we are obligated to provide under collaborative agreements that will fully offset the expenses in connection with those services 
potential milestone payments to be received under existing license agreements are outside of our control and far less predictable 
fiscal revenues from new sources  such as license fees and milestone payments  will depend substantially on whether or not we elect to enter into additional license arrangements and whether or not we achieve milestones under those arrangements 
such arrangements could be in the form of licensing or partnering agreements for docosanol cream  neurodex  or for our other product development programs including development of a selective cytokine inhibitor 
many of our product development programs could take years of additional development before they reach the stage of being licensable to other pharmaceutical companies 
in anticipation of a product launch of neurodex within several months of approval of the drug  if approved by fda for marketing  we expect to raise additional capital to support the potential launch and marketing of the drug 
potential alternatives that we could pursue for raising capital include  but are not limited to  partnering arrangements where partners share development costs  issuance of debt or equity securities under our june shelf registration statement  and licensing or sales of one or more of our platform technologies or new drug candidates 
the balance of securities available for sale under the existing shelf registration is approximately million 
if we are unable to raise capital as needed to fund our operations  or if we are unable to reach milestones in our license agreements or enter into any new collaborative arrangements  then we may need to slow the rate of development of some of our programs or sell the rights to one or more of our drug candidates 
for information regarding the risks associated with our need to raise capital to fund our ongoing and planned operations  please see risk factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described below  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
because substantially all our revenues  expenses  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is immaterial 
however  in the future we could face increasing exposure to foreign currency exchange rates as we expand international distribution of docosanol cream and purchase additional services from outside the us until such time as we are faced with material amounts of foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments  which can be used to hedge such risks 
we will evaluate the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposures as the needs and risks should arise 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income instruments with an average duration of years as of september  years as of september  
the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while achieving attractive yields  without significantly increasing risk 
we classify our investments in securities as of september  as available for sale and our restricted investments in securities as held to maturity 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk 
in general  we would expect that the volatility of this portfolio would decrease as its duration decreases 
based on the average duration of our investments as of september  and  an increase of one percentage point in the interest rates would have resulted in increases in comprehensive losses of approximately  and  respectively
