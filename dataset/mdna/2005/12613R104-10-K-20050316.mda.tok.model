item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview cnet networks  inc is a worldwide media company and creator of content environments for the interactive age 
we operate industry leading websites  each with its own distinct brand  in three content categories personal technology  games and entertainment  and business technology 
we have determined that our business segments are us media and international media 
us media consists of an online network focused on three content categories personal technology  games and entertainment  and business technology  as well as a print publication 
beginning in  us media also includes channel services  a product database licensing business and an online technology marketplace for resellers  distributors and manufacturers 
previously  channel services was presented as a separate segment  however  as we continued to see a convergence of customer relationships between us media and the channel services product offerings  we determined that combining the reporting of the results of channel services within us media more accurately reflected the decision making processes  internal reporting and resource allocation within these businesses 
international media includes the delivery of online technology information and several technology and gaming print publications in non us markets 
within these business segments  we earn revenues from marketing services sales of advertisements on our internet network through impression based advertising fees earned from the number of times an advertisement is viewed by users of our websites and activity based advertising fees earned when our users click on an advertisement or text link to visit the websites of our merchant partners  or download a software application or a whitepaper  licensing  fees and users licensing our product database and online content  subscriptions to our online services  and other paid services  and publishing sales of advertisements in our print publications  subscriptions and newsstand sales of publications  and custom publishing services 

table of contents we evaluate our revenues according to the classifications listed above 
we classify our marketing services revenues and licensing  fees and user revenues as interactive revenues and our publishing revenues as publishing revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
revenues for the past three years for these categories are as follows in thousands year ended december  revenues marketing services licensing  fees and user interactive publishing as a percentage of revenues marketing services licensing  fees and user interactive publishing we had an average of million unique users per month in the fourth quarter of  compared to million unique users in the fourth quarter of  an increase of 
these users generated over million web page views per day during the fourth quarter compared to million in  a increase 
while increases or decreases in unique users and daily average page views are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in financial results  we believe that these statistics are helpful because they provide insight into the growth of the internet as an advertising medium resulting from increased user adoption and into user demand for cnet networks properties in particular 
operating expenses included in our operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment consist of cost of revenues  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs  which are primarily cash related expense activities 
the majority of our cash related expenses are costs associated with employee compensation  benefits and facilities  which represented over of our total operating expenses in noncash related expenses consist of depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment and are included in our operating income loss 
cost of revenues includes costs associated with the production and delivery of our internet sites  print publications and creation of our product database and related technology 
the principal elements of cost of revenues for our internet operations are compensation and related expenses for the editorial  production and technology staff and related costs for facilities and equipment 
cost of revenues for our publishing operations includes compensation and related expenses for editorial personnel and costs to print and distribute our magazines and related costs for facilities and equipment 
the majority of our cost of revenues does not necessarily fluctuate proportionately with fluctuations in revenues 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses  consulting fees and advertising expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses and related costs for facilities and equipment 
we evaluate our financial performance primarily on the following key measurements revenues operating income loss operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment net income loss earnings loss per share 
table of contents results in  we experienced growth and expansion in our overall product offerings  customer base and audience  resulting in revenue growth and profit improvement 
we have continued to drive user and traffic growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
we added several new properties  products and services to our portfolio during  adding more features and services to our existing sites 
we have increased our site content partnerships with other media organizations enabling us to increase the exposure of our brands to more people 
through acquisitions we added reach and revenue capacity as well as expanded our content categories and customer base 
webshots has provided us additional users and usage  and the opportunity to expand the number of out of category advertisers 
the zol and fengniao acquisitions in china will allow us to expand our online presence in china and position ourselves to be able to capitalize on the potential of the chinese market 
cnet networks revenue growth in was primarily driven by our ability to sell more advertising inventory rather than through price increases 
we were able to achieve revenue growth in with moderate operating expense growth 
the fact that revenue growth exceeded the growth in operating expenses during  allowed us to meet our goal of percent year over year incremental margin 
we define incremental margin as the percentage of new revenue dollars that flow to operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment as compared to the previous year 
the calculation of incremental margin for excludes million of realignment expenses recorded in as shown in the table below  we had operating income of million for the year ended december  and we incurred an operating loss of million and million for the years ended december  and we had an operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment of million and million in and  respectively  and an operating loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment of million for our net income and net income per diluted share for the year ended december  was million  or per share 
our net loss and net loss per share for the years ended december  and was million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively 
in thousands  except per share data year ended december  operating income loss depreciation amortization asset impairment operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment net income loss net income loss per diluted share we believe that operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment is useful to management and investors as a supplement to our gaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states financial measures in evaluating our current operating performance  since depreciation  amortization and asset impairment include the impact of past transactions and costs that are not necessarily directly related to the current underlying capital requirements or performance of the business operations 
management refers to operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment to compare historical operating results  in making operating decisions and for planning and compensation purposes 
a limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue 
management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial measures  such as capital expenditures  and using operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment only supplementally 
although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the capitalized assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and operating income loss before 
table of contents depreciation  amortization and asset impairment does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
this measure also does not take into account interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt 
nor does the measure reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs 
operating income before depreciation  amortization and asset impairment should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  identified the following material weakness we did not maintain sufficient levels of appropriately qualified personnel in our financial reporting processes 
as a result  we did not consistently follow established internal control over financial reporting procedures related to a the timely preparation of comprehensive documentation supporting management s analysis of the appropriate accounting treatment for non routine and complex transactions and b the review of such documentation by internal staff or outside advisors to determine its completeness and propriety of the conclusions 
as a result of these internal control deficiencies  we initially overstated goodwill and understated our asset impairment expenses as of and for the year ended december  this error was corrected prior to the publication of our financial statements

the operations in switzerland  which were the headquarters of our channel services operations  were transitioned to the united states in the second quarter of as part of that transition  we no longer require the land and buildings we own in switzerland  and we are attempting to sell them 
we have reclassified the land and building to assets held for sale 
intangible assets amortization expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that our amortization expense will increase due to intangible assets acquired during asset impairment we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment as of august  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets for all of our reporting units did not exceed their implied fair values 
during the fourth quarter of  a reassessment of the carrying value of the computer shopper reporting unit was performed based on a revised forecast of revenues for this business resulting from a projected decline of advertising spending on technology publications

as a result  we may determine to raise proceeds for potential acquisitions through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
additionally  we can not predict what our aggregate cash balances will be in the future when our existing debt obligations become due  which could also require the issuance of debt or equity securities 
our ability to raise additional capital will depend on our financial performance and market conditions at the time 
on october   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission covering the issuance of up to million in securities 
this shelf registration enables us to take advantage of favorable market conditions and opportunistically access the capital markets 
our ability to raise additional capital will depend on our financial performance and market conditions at the time

a credit facility 
the borrowings may be drawn down as revolving loans or as term loans when the purpose is to fund a permitted acquisition 
interest rates applicable to amounts outstanding under term loans or revolvers are  at cnet networks option  either the base rate or the eurodollar rate  where the base rate is the higher of the federal funds rate plus and the lender s prime rate  and the eurodollar rate is libor plus

off balance sheet arrangements the following item is a contingency  which may affect our liquidity in future periods 
in conjunction with the zdnet acquisition in  cnet networks assumed a guarantee of the obligations of ziff davis media inc  an unaffiliated company and primary lessor  under a new york city office lease for a total of  square feet 
this lease expires in the annual average cost per square foot is approximately thirty dollars over the remaining term of the lease 
ziff davis media inc currently occupies  square feet of this space 
ziff davis media inc subleases  square feet to the bank of new york  fojp risk management and softbank  collectively

if the financial condition of any of the sublessees or the primary lessee were to deteriorate and thereby result in an inability to make their lease payments  cnet networks would be required to make their lease payments under the guarantee 
in connection with that guarantee  we also have a letter of credit for million outstanding as a security deposit 
this letter of credit is collateralized by a deposit in escrow  which is included in restricted cash 
as there is no present obligation to make any payments in connection with this guarantee  cnet networks has not recorded any liability for this guarantee in its financial statements 
outlook for we are focused on expanding our content coverage and services to help us continue to grow the number of users visiting our properties and advertiser base 
in particular  we are focused on expanding the content coverage and services in our faster growing areas  such as personal technology and games and entertainment 
we believe that expansion may occur through a combination of organic growth  acquisitions  or partnerships with third parties 
we expect that expanding our content coverage and user base should make our offerings even more relevant to our in category  as well as our newer out of category  customers  such as financial services  automotive manufacturing  retail and consumer packaged goods 
we expect our growth in revenues to exceed any incremental increase in operating costs  before depreciation and amortization  resulting in an increase in operating margin 
we expect there will be continued growth in revenues from marketing services in the personal technology and games and entertainment sectors and stable revenues within our business technology category 
we anticipate revenues from our publishing operations in the us to decline due to a continuing shift in media consumption towards online content 
we expect that online revenues will represent an increasing proportion of international revenues reflecting faster online revenue growth than publishing 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to collectibility of receivables  investments  goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues once the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of our obligation to our customer has occurred  the price to be charged to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the fees to be charged is reasonably assured 

table of contents we have several revenue streams 
for each revenue stream  evidence of the arrangement  delivery and pricing may be different 
for all revenue streams  we determine that collectibility is reasonably assured through a standardized credit review to determine each customer s credit worthiness 
marketing services we recognize revenues from the sale of impression based advertisements on our online network in the period in which the advertisements are delivered 
the arrangements are evidenced either by insertion orders or contracts that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered and pricing 
our customers are billed based on pricing as determined on the insertion order or contract  which may include certain discounts from list price
