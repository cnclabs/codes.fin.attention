item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
highlights ntn s financial and operating results for the year ended december  included the following highlights o on january   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million  pursuant to an existing shelf registration filed under the securities act 
after commissions and expenses  the net proceeds of this offering were approximately million 
the offering was purchased primarily by a number of institutional investors and by media general  inc  a related party  which invested approximately million 
o in april  time warner cable launched the buzztime channel as part of its interactive television games channel in la place  louisiana 
o in july  we launched our new ntn blast channel on the ntn itv network 
ntn blast was developed to help land as customers new hospitality sites that might not be attracted to our core trivia and sports products and to retain existing hospitality sites with the expanded content offering 
ntn blast is played on our new underlying itv technology  which enables us to display two video channels on the ntn itv network 
o in november  comcast cable launched the buzztime channel in its alexandria arlington system and prince william system 
both cable television systems service portions of the northern virginia area 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred costs and revenues  depreciation of broadcast equipment  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  financing operations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we record deferred costs and revenues related to the costs and related installation revenue associated with installing new customer sites 
based on staff accounting bulletin sab  we amortize these amounts over an estimated three year average life of a customer relationship 
o we incur a relatively significant level of depreciation expense in relationship to our operating income 
the amount of depreciation expense in any fiscal year is largely related to the estimated life of handheld  wireless playmaker devices  vsat satellite dishes and associated electronics and the computers located at our customer sites 
the playmakers are depreciated over a four year life  vsat dishes and associated electronics over a four year life and the computers over a three year life 
the depreciable life of these assets was determined based upon their estimated useful life which considers anticipated technology changes 
if our playmakers  vsat dishes and associated electronics and the computers turn out to have longer lives  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly reduced in those future periods 
conversely  if the playmakers  vsat dishes and associated electronics and the computers turn out to have shorter lives  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly increased in those future periods 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined based on reserving for all domestic customers that have terminated our itv network service plus five percent of outstanding balances for all unreserved customer balances across all of our domestic businesses and  for canadian customers  all accounts over days past due 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o revenues from software solutions are recognized in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred at our customer s location  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable  provided that vendor specific evidence exists for any undelivered elements  namely annual support and maintenance 
along with the basic software license  our customers are provided post contract support pcs for an additional fee  which is based on a stipulated percentage of the license fee 
pcs consists of technical support as well as unspecified software upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes due 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if an arrangement allows for customer acceptance  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
additionally  we provide consulting and training services under both hourly based time and materials and fixed priced contracts 
revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
o we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions 
at december  the net amount of  of goodwill and intangible assets represented of total assets 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase combination determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we annually perform tests for goodwill impairment as required by sfas we continually monitor for any potential indicators of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and we have determined that no such indicators have arisen to date 
any impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
o in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and superseding apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the company to expense grants made under the stock option and employee stock purchase plan programs 
that cost will be recognized over the vesting period of the plans 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  amounts previously disclosed under sfas no 
will be recorded in the consolidated income statement 
we are evaluating the alternatives allowed under the standard  which we are required to adopt beginning in the third quarter of we believe that this new standard will increase our operating losses in the future but that increase will be of a non cash nature 
we do not have any of the following o off balance sheet arrangements except for purchase orders and commitments and operating leases  o certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value or speculative or hedging instruments  or o relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from any non independent relationship other than the related party transactions discussed in item certain relationships and related transactions which item is incorporated by reference to our definitive proxy statement or which are so non material to fall below the materiality threshold of such item 
assessments of functional currencies 
the us dollar is the functional currency of all of the company s operations except for its newly acquired canadian operations 
background our business is developing and distributing interactive entertainment and wireless information and communications products 
we operate our business principally through two operating units the ntn hospitality technologies division and buzztime 
the ntn hospitality technologies division includes the ntn itv network  ntn wireless and software solutions 
revenues generated and operating income loss by our two business units are illustrated below 
the data presented below includes allocations of corporate expenses and elimination of intercompany charges 
years ended december revenues ntn hospitality technologies division 
   buzztime    other    total    operating income loss ntn hospitality technologies division 
   buzztime    total    ntn hospitality technologies revenue is generated primarily from providing an interactive entertainment service which serves as a marketing and promotional vehicle for the hospitality industry  from its wireless business with restaurant on site paging systems and electronic data managed comment cards and from its hardware and software enterprise solutions 
buzztime s revenue is primarily generated from the distribution of its digital trivia game show content as well as revenue related to production services for third parties and from performance under a trial agreement with a major cable operator 
results of operations following is a comparative discussion by fiscal year of the results of operations for the three years ended december  we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of operations for the periods presented 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  operations for resulted in a net loss of  compared to net loss of  for revenues the revenues of the ntn hospitality technologies division increased by  or  to  in from  in included twelve months of operations of the software solutions segment and the ntn canada unit while included only five months and two weeks of operations from those entities  respectively 
for the purpose of this analysis  the ntn itv network s revenues include  and  of other revenues for and  respectively shown on our consolidated statements of operations 
the revenue contribution from the three operating segments of the division for and are shown in the following table components of hospitality technologies division revenue change ntn itv network    ntn wireless    software solutions    total revenue of division    within the ntn itv network there are several revenue contributors  including our core subscription revenue  canadian licensing revenue in  installation revenue  advertising revenue and since december   revenue from our canadian operations 
the primary revenue components are broken out in the following table components of ntn itv network revenue change subscription revenues    canadian license revenue   subscription and installation revenue from canadian operations    advertising revenue united states    advertising revenue canada    installation revenue    ntn itv network    as noted in the above table  our subscription revenue from core hospitality operations increased by  or  due to an increase in net site count and average per site revenue 
licensing revenues from our canadian licensee ceased in the fourth quarter of as we finalized the acquisition of the operations of the licensee 
on december   we acquired the operations of our canadian licensee  so we now show the overall revenues of the canadian operation rather than the previous license revenue 
in  the ntn itv network generated domestic advertising revenue of approximately  compared to approximately  in this  decrease was due to several advertising campaigns in the period that ended without comparable campaigns in the period 
installation revenue associated with installing new customer locations decreased  or 
this was primarily due to deferred revenue associated with prior year installations becoming fully amortized 
to a lesser extent  over the past two years  we have adopted a strategy of charging new sites a lower installation fee and higher recurring monthly fees than our previous pricing in order to grow our customer base 
this strategy has had the beneficial impact of increasing our subscription revenues as noted in the above chart but it has also reduced the amount of deferred revenue from those new sites that is recognized as installation revenue over an average customer life of three years 
this trend coupled with the falloff of amortization of deferred revenue from prior years led to this lower level of installation revenue 
however  we believe this move to a lower installation fee coupled with higher recurring fees has a greater long term financial benefit to ntn 
we added net new domestic sites in compared to a decrease of net new domestic sites in this domestic site count increase was the largest annual net addition of sites in years 
the ntn itv network customer site count in the united states at december  was  this was an increase of sites over the december  united states site count of  our canadian site count at december  was this was a decrease of sites from the december  canadian site count of approximately buzztime service revenues increased  or  to  in from  in the primary factor in the increase was  from united states and canadian satellite operators for distribution of buzztime trivia to their users on a subscription basis 
there was no comparable satellite related revenue in included  in revenues recognized under a development agreement with a major cable operator compared to  in the remainder of the revenue growth came from a variety of sources including increases in license revenue from suscom  digeo and ictv 
as a result of the above factors  ntn s consolidated revenues increased  or  to  in from  in operating expenses direct operating costs direct operating costs of services increased  or  to  in from  in a significant amount of this increase was because had a full year of operations of software solutions compared to approximately five months in and because we operated ntn canada for a full year in compared to two weeks in the following table compares the direct costs for each of our operating segments between and direct operating costs change ntn itv network    ntn wireless    software solutions    hospitality technologies division    buzztime    consolidated company    our direct operating costs in the ntn itv network increased by  in this increase was due to a  increase in our direct operating costs with ntn canada 
that  increase in canadian direct costs was partially offset by a  decrease in domestic direct operating costs 
this  decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in direct depreciation  which  in turn  was caused by an increasing level of fully depreciated broadcast equipment at our customer sites and to a  reduction of communication expenses 
the  increase in software solutions direct operating costs largely related to the cost of goods sold associated with twelve months of operations in that segment in compared to five months in the gross margin of software solutions in was  a decrease from the gross margin of 
the gross margin decline was due to a larger hardware component as a percentage of revenue in than in and greater license expense relating to certain microsoft products imbedded in our software 
our hardware revenues typically carry lower margins than our software revenues 
the  increase in the ntn wireless direct operating costs largely related to the cost of goods sold associated with the ntn wireless revenue increase of  in noted above 
the gross margin of ntn wireless was comparable in both years with a gross margin of in and a gross margin of in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in from  in a great deal of this increase was because had a full year of operations of software solutions compared to approximately five months in and a full year of operations of ntn canada in compared to two weeks in the following table compares the selling  general and administrative expenses for each of our operating segments between and selling  general and administrative expenses change ntn itv network    ntn wireless    software solutions    hospitality technologies division    buzztime    consolidated company    the  sg a increase in the ntn itv network segment was largely due to  of sg a expenses in our new ntn canada subsidiary compared to  in  or a  increase 
the remainder of the sg a increase of  in the ntn itv network s domestic operations came from a variety of items including increased salaries and benefits of approximately  increased office rental expense of  increased telephone expense of  increased marketing expenses of  and increased repairs and maintenance expense of approximately  the increases in salaries and related expenses were related to the hiring of additional personnel 
sg a expenses decreased  in the ntn wireless segment largely due to a combination of factors including reduced bad debt expense 
the  sg a increase in the buzztime segment was largely due to increased payroll of  partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses of  sg a expenses include an allocation of our corporate sg a to the segments based on a variety of factors  including headcount  square footage of facilities and other factors 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense increased by  or  to  in compared to  in this increase largely arises from recognition of non cash expense associated with the grants of certain deferred stock units to our executives in under the performance incentive plan 
litigation  legal and professional fees litigation  legal and professional fees increased  or  to  in compared to  in this increase relates to  of sarbanes oxley related expenses  an increase of  in legal fees related to the long range systems litigation in our wireless segment  an increase of  in audit fees  additional legal fees for trademark registrations and generally to an increase in the scope of our business 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization not related to direct operating costs increased  or  to  in from  in due to increases in amortization expense in software solutions and ntn canada of  and  respectively 
those increases reflected a full year of amortization related to identified intangible assets compared to five months of amortization with software solutions and two weeks of amortization with ntn canada 
the combined amortization increase of  in software solutions and ntn canada was partially offset by lower levels of depreciation and amortization throughout the remainder of ntn largely due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated research and development expenses research and development expenses were  in both and research and development expenses  which are salary expense  primarily related to projects to develop new technologies for the itv network 
other income expense interest income and expense interest income increased  to  in  compared to  in this increase was due to a larger amount of cash invested in short term marketable securities in than in interest expense decreased  or  to  in  compared to  in  due to the expiration of various capitalized leases and a paid down line of credit for the majority of the year  partially offset by the imputed interest associated with the equipment notes payable 
other income other income was  in this other income arose from the settlement of a derivative securities lawsuit 
in  we recorded  of other income that arose from a gain on early extinguishment of debt 
minority interest minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary decreased  to zero in compared to  in the figure represented an allocation of six percent of buzztime s losses for only the first half of the month of january since scientific atlanta converted their minority interest in the buzztime subsidiary into ntn common stock on january  income taxes for the year ended december   the ntn hospitality technologies division had taxable income in canada and a loss in the united states

the interest rate to be applied to the unpaid principal balance is over the index 
the line originally was set to mature on july  and contained one financial covenant based on our cash flow coverage of the balance on the line of credit

the consideration allocated to the acquired boxerjam game license was valued at million and is being amortized over the estimated contractual life of years  which assumes  based on management s intention that we will exercise our five year renewal option 
we determined that  based on the lack of marketability of buzztime common stock and limited convertibility into ntn common stock  the fair value of the buzztime warrants was not material and no allocation of fair value was made 
on january   media general invested approximately million as one of the purchasers in the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share

those firms paid us approximately million on november  in order to exercise those warrants 
these warrants were existing instruments that were issued as part of a previous financing by those firms

after commissions and expenses  the net proceeds of this offering were approximately million 
the offering was purchased primarily by a number of institutional investors and by media general  inc  a related party  which invested approximately million 
future financing needs our liquidity and capital resources  while stronger than in recent years  remain limited and this may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
in we experienced the most significant increase in itv site sales in seven years  with  site sales compared with an average of less than per year over the previous six years 
we believe this sales increase can be attributed in large part to our announcement in february of the planned deployment of a wireless electronic multi player version of the popular poker game  texas hold em  on our itv network in early additionally  we are half way through the conversion of approximately canadian itv network sites to our newest itv technology  which allows the play of texas hold em  as well as other new game content 
on february   we announced the deployment of texas hold em to all of our itv sites  which numbered about in north america 
over the first two months of  we have witnessed continued strong growth of sales for the ntn itv network 
at the nightclub and bar trade show in early march  which is one of our strongest trade shows  we had continued strong sales success 
we see no signs of this sales growth abating 
each new site requires a capital investment of approximately  when connected to the itv network via vsat satellite technology 
thus  even though we believe there is a high likelihood that we have sufficient cash to operate our businesses through  we may decide to bolster cash reserves during the year due to the capital requirements associated with the equipment installations arising out of these high sales levels being achieved 
capital requirements in will additionally depend upon two other growth initiatives 
the first is the launch of our itv network in the uk  beginning with an initial trial of eleven itv network sites that began on march  we believe that a significant growth opportunity exists in the uk for our itv product  and success in sales would require substantial capital for any level of significant deployments 
the second is the intended broad distribution of the buzztime channel in digital cable television systems as sales efforts continue to focus on cable msos the largest multiple system operators in the united states 
with eight current sites in operation  if this initiative succeeds as planned and we enter into national agreements with those cable operators  we intend to aggressively increase buzztime sales and marketing efforts to more quickly advance our distribution within the us market 
a primary driver of capital use over the past two years has been the cost of deploying the vsat technology in our ntn itv network 
for more than ten years  we transmitted our data through the fm satellite one way platform 
in  we were informed that this platform would no longer be available to us after february after considering several alternative delivery channels  we entered into equipment purchase and satellite service agreements in to convert the network to a much higher speed  two way vsat very small aperture technology satellite technology over the two year period ending february these agreements were with the same reseller of satellite services that provided the fm satellite platform to us 
the vsat technology is more expensive than fm  and  with our strong sales in  our cash usage increased to fund the new installations 
on january   after learning that the fm platform life was being extended  we amended our agreements with our satellite services provider to push out the expiration date on the fm satellite platform to february and to modify our vsat equipment purchase and satellite service agreements 
the amendments will help us in three ways first  the modification to the equipment purchase agreement eliminates the requirement to purchase and install a specific amount of vsat equipment 
second  the flexibility will enable us to utilize non satellite based data transmission platforms  such as digital subscriber lines dsl  wireless connectivity or cable modems  for customer sites where such platforms may be appropriate 
the company has begun installing some sites with dsl connectivity in areas that cannot be reached by vsat  which lowers the cost of the installations by a significant amount of approximately  per site 
third  the amendment allows us to slow our rate of converting sites from the fm system to the new vsat platform over the remainder of the amended fm satellite services agreement  which is now scheduled to end in february as of december   approximately of our domestic sites had been converted to vsat equipment 
we anticipate that with the extension of fm sites  an increasing number of dsl installations and the revised vsat agreement  north america installation costs overall and installation costs per site over the coming years will trend down from what was seen in and we also believe that  as in  ntn canada will continue to require a significant amount of capital investment 
we acquired the ntn canada network assets of our canadian licensee in december the previous owner had not converted the canadian customer base to ditv during the to period when our domestic sites were converted  and the canadian network had become antiquated and was rapidly losing customers 
following the purchase  we have been in the process of upgrading the technology for all active sites there 
through december   approximately of the canadian sites had been converted to itv  our newest technology platform  and connected via either vsat or dsl communication platforms 
over the next months we plan to convert the remaining of our current customer base at a cost on the order of  however  we believe that these canadian capital expenditures will be financed through the operating cash flow we generate in canada 
beyond the capital requirements generated by growth issues discussed above  if we generate operating losses in excluding non cash charges that are similar in size to the operating losses we produced in excluding non cash charges and if our capital expenditure levels are comparable in to the capital expenditure levels in  then we will deplete much of our cash reserve and would likely either raise additional capital or constrain our growth to generate sufficient cash to operate the business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all 
we also have taken actions to reduce our operating losses in two of the segments that produced losses in as follows software solutions segment we reduced the workforce by employees in december and  in february  we sold off the vision point of sale product line  which had produced losses  to a new venture formed by the former president of breakaway international 
we retained a ownership in that new venture 
wireless segment this segment would have been profitable in if it had not borne the costs of the long range systems lrs litigation 
we recently settled that litigation and we believe that segment should produce operating profits going forward although that segment is very competitive and the gross margins of that segment remain under pressure 
risk factors risk factors that may affect future results our business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following we have experienced significant losses and we expect to incur significant net losses in the future 
we have a history of significant losses  including net losses of  in   in and  in  and an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating and net losses for the next four quarters due primarily to our continued development of buzztime 
furthermore  we may never achieve profitability  and even if we do  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our limited liquidity and capital resources may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
at december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately  our liquidity and capital resources remain limited and this may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
we have a revolving line of credit agreement with pacific mercantile bank  which provides for borrowings of up to  and which was originally to expire in july by its terms 
effective january   we entered into an agreement with pacific mercantile to extend the maturity date of the line of credit to february  we subsequently extended the expiration date of the line to february  as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
any reduction in availability under our line of credit may further constrain our liquidity 
capital requirements in will depend primarily upon the growth of our two business units 
we have three growth initiatives underway  any one of which could drive the need for additional capital 
these initiatives are the potential sales growth of north american itv network sites beyond our historical annual average sales level of approximately sites due to the launch of our texas hold em game  uk itv network growth as a result of the launch of eleven itv network trials that began there on march   and potential installations of the buzztime network if a broad deployment agreement is reached with a cable operator 
if the company follows a low growth scenario  utilization of our cash and existing million line of credit is expected to be sufficient to cover our financing requirements for however  our itv network sales were strong through and through the first two months of  therefore we may decide to bolster cash reserves during the year through an equity offering 
beyond the capital requirements generated by growth issues discussed above  if we generate operating losses in excluding non cash charges that are similar in size to the operating losses we produced in excluding non cash charges and if our capital expenditure levels are comparable in to the capital expenditure levels in  then we will require additional capital or will be forced to constrain our growth to generate sufficient cash to operate the business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all 
new products and rapid technological change may render our operations obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we do not compete successfully in the development of new products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to achieve profitability or sustain a meaningful market position 
the interactive entertainment and game industry  as well as the wireless paging and software applications industries  are becoming highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes when compared to other industries 
we are aware of other companies that are introducing interactive game products on various platforms that allow players to compete across the nation 
we are also aware of other companies that are developing and introducing wireless technology and software applications that may be suitable for use in the hospitality industry 
the wireless paging industry is highly competitive  we may experience pricing pressure in the wireless markets that could impact our margins with respect to our wireless product line 
some of these companies have substantially greater financial resources and organizational capital than we do  which could allow them to identify emerging trends 
in addition  changes in customer tastes may render our network and its content  our technology and our wireless and software products obsolete or noncompetitive 
the emergence of new entertainment products and technologies  changes in consumer preferences and other factors may limit the life cycle of our technologies and any future products and services we develop 
accordingly  our future performance will depend on our ability to o identify emerging technological trends in our market  o identify changing consumer needs  desires or tastes  o develop and maintain competitive technology  including new product and service offerings  o improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to technological changes and competitive offerings  and o bring technology to the market quickly at cost effective prices 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing customer needs 
such products and services may not gain market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure in developing new or enhanced technology  including new product and service offerings  could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues 
we must effectively compete within the highly competitive software industry 
the software industry is intensely competitive 
several large vendors develop and market database management programs  business and management applications  collaboration products and business intelligence products that compete with our ntn software solutions offerings 
some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources than we do 
we expect to continue to face intense competition in the software market in which we compete 
we could lose market share if our competitors introduce new competitive products into one or more of our markets  add new functionality into an existing competitive product  acquire a competitive product  reduce prices  or form strategic alliances with other companies 
in addition  because new distribution methods and opportunities offered by the internet and electronic commerce have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by small and start up companies in the software industry  we expect to face additional future competition from these companies 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  we may lose business and experience reduced profitability 
continued implementation of our business plan requires an effective planning and management process 
our anticipated future growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
if we are to grow successfully  we must o improve our operational  administrative and financial systems  o expand  train and manage our workforce  and o attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel 
the interactive gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive 
the entertainment business is highly competitive 
we compete with other companies for total entertainment related revenues in the marketplace 
our network programming competes generally with broadcast television  direct satellite programming  pay per view  other content offered on cable television  and other forms of entertainment 
furthermore  certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources available to them 
the entrance of motion picture  cable and television companies in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries will likely intensify competition in the future 
we also compete with other content and services available to consumers through online services 
the expanded use of online networks and the internet provide computer users with an increasing number of alternatives to video games and entertainment software 
with this increasing competition and rapidly changing factors  we must be able to compete in terms of technology  content and management strategy 
if we fail to provide quality services and products  we will lose revenues to other competitors in the entertainment industry 
increased competition may also result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles  reduced revenues and loss of market share 
if intellectual property law and practice do not adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  our business could be seriously damaged 
we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in some of our products 
furthermore  it is our policy that all employees and consultants involved in research and development activities sign nondisclosure agreements 
our competitors may  however  misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours 
our competitors may also challenge or circumvent our proprietary rights 
if we have to initiate or defend against an infringement claim in the future to protect our proprietary rights  the litigation over such claims could be time consuming and costly to us  adversely affecting our financial condition 
from time to time  we hire or retain employees or external consultants who may work for other companies developing products similar to those offered by us 
these former employers may claim that our products are based on their products and that we have misappropriated their intellectual property 
any such litigation could prevent us from exploiting our proprietary portfolio and cause us to incur substantial costs  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business 
we believe that the success of our business depends upon such factors as the technical expertise  innovative skills and marketing and customer relations abilities of our employees  as well as upon patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 
as of december   we owned one united states patent covering certain aspects of technology related to an interactive learning system 
this patent will expire in as of december   we had applied for two additional patents in the united states 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with competitive advantages 
third parties might challenge our patents 
in addition  patents held by third parties might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
furthermore  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or  to the extent patents are issued to us  design around those patents 
others may have filed and in the future may file patent applications that are similar or identical to those of ours 
to determine the priority of inventions  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office 
such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
such third party patent applications might have priority over patent applications filed by us 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the ntn itv network  the buzztime trivia channel and the internet 
we make content available on the ntn itv network  the buzztime trivia channel and the internet 
the availability of this content could result in claims against us based on a variety of theories  including defamation  obscenity  negligence or copyright or trademark infringement 
we could also be exposed to liability for third party content accessed through the links from our web sites to other web sites 
we may incur costs to defend ourselves against even baseless claims  and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are found liable for information that we make available 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure may require us to spend substantial resources and may limit the attractiveness of our services to users 
we may face exposure on sales and or use taxes in various states 
from time to time  state tax authorities will make inquiries as to whether or not a portion of our services might require the collection of sales and use taxes from customers in those states 
in the current difficult economic climate  many states are expanding their interpretation of their sales and use tax statutes to derive additional revenue 
while in the past our sales and use tax assessments have not been significant to our operations  it is likely that such expenses will grow in the future 
our games and game shows are subject to gaming regulations 
we operate games of skill and chance that  in some instances  reward prizes 
these games are regulated in many jurisdictions 
the selection of prizewinners is sometimes based on chance  although none of our games require any form of monetary payment 
we also operate interactive skill card games  such as texas hold em poker and blackjack 
these skill card games are restricted in several jurisdictions 
the laws and regulations that govern these games  however  are subject to differing interpretations in each jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change in any of the jurisdictions in which we offer our games 
if such changes were to happen  we may find it necessary to eliminate  modify or cancel certain components of our products that could result in additional development costs and or the possible loss of revenue 
if our chief executive officer were to leave us  our business may be adversely affected 
our success greatly depends on the efforts of our chief executive officer 
our ability to operate successfully will depend significantly on his services and contributions 
therefore  we entered into an employment agreement with mr 
stanley b 
kinsey on september  to provide for an extended term of his services as ntn ceo through february  this employment agreement included an increase in annual salary  a grant of  deferred stock units under the ntn communications  inc performance incentive plan  and a grant of options to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
mr 
kinsey continues to discharge his obligations under the september  agreement while the extension of this agreement is being negotiated between mr 
kinsey and the compensation committee of our board of directors 
the negotiation is expected to conclude by the end of april however  our business and operations may be adversely affected if he were to leave before his employment agreement is renewed 
we may have difficulty recruiting professionals for our business 
our business requires experienced programmers  creative designers and application developers 
our success will depend on identifying  hiring  training and retaining such experienced  knowledgeable professionals 
we must recruit talented professionals in order for our business to grow 
there is significant competition for employees with the skills required to develop the products and perform the services we offer 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future to sustain and grow our business  or that we will be successful in motivating and retaining the employees we are able to attract 
if we cannot attract  motivate and retain qualified professionals  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could harm our business 
on december  we acquired  through ntn canada  most of the operating assets  certain liabilities and the operations of ntnin from chell group corporation 
this acquisition added an additional customer sites that pay us in canadian dollars to use our interactive technology  and to receive our game service 
since both the service fees and our canadian subsidiary s operating expenses are recognized in canadian dollars  our financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as we are currently beginning a trial of the itv network in the united kingdom  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates may continue to increase in the future 
communication failures with our subscriber locations could result in the cancellation of subscribers and a decrease in our revenues 
we rely on both satellite and telephone systems to communicate with our subscriber locations 
we currently transmit the majority of our data to our hospitality customer sites via panamsat s galaxy iiir satellite and will rely upon galaxy iiic for data transmission in connection with our new vsat two way communication technology 
we have currently converted approximately of our domestic sites to the vsat technology 
interruption in communications with our subscriber locations under either system could decrease customer loyalty and satisfaction and result in a cancellation of our services 
we are continually reviewing alternative telephone service providers and establishing contingency plans  however  such alternative providers and contingency plans have not been finalized 
in the event that we were forced to switch to another satellite  we would incur significant costs associated with re pointing our satellite receivers 
in addition  we could experience higher operating costs to transmit data to our customers via telephone lines and the internet during the transition period 
another potential risk is the possibility that our government could pre empt our satellite for national security reasons  as the united states satellite operators are federally licensed 
this would appear to be unlikely as our government has a strong communications infrastructure in place domestically 
risk factors associated with buzztime we may sell equity interests in buzztime to third parties  which could result in the loss of control of buzztime or devaluation of our equity interest in buzztime 
in june  we sold a interest in buzztime to an affiliate of scientific atlanta  a leading cable television set top box manufacturer 
while scientific atlanta s investment position was converted to our common stock in january  we believe there may be divergent investment preferences between the strategies pursued by the ntn itv network and buzztime and may decide in the future to continue to raise additional financing by issuing and selling equity interests in buzztime to third parties 
to enhance the ability of buzztime to raise such financing  we have previously contributed and may contribute in the future some of our assets to buzztime in order to allow the development of a distinct identity that we believe is necessary for it to effectively grow as a separate concern 
these assets include our extensive trivia game show library and our interactive play along sports games and related intangible assets 
from an operational standpoint  we could lose control of buzztime 
if we lose control  buzztime may no longer provide adequate support and resources for content and programming for the ntn itv network  affecting the ability of the ntn itv network to continue its operations 
from a financial viewpoint  we could undervalue the stock of buzztime when selling it to third parties or undervalue assets transferred to buzztime and this could devalue your holdings in ntn because we would not receive the fair value for our interest in buzztime 
if our new buzztime programming is not accepted by consumers  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
the new buzztime channel faces risks as to whether consumers will accept interactive television products and the trivia programming produced by buzztime 
if interactive television does not become a successful  scaleable medium or if consumers do not accept trivia and play along sports games  then we will be unable to draw revenues from advertising  direct marketing of third party products  subscription fees and pay per play fees 
until a sufficient market develops for the digital set top boxes enabled to run our interactive television game applications  our profit potential is uncertain 
we may also be unable to attract local cable operators to add buzztime programming as a channel to their service 
the market for interactive television games and services is new and may not develop as anticipated 
the interactive television market currently is small and emerging 
the success of buzztime will depend on the growth and development of this market in the united states and it will depend upon the commercialization and broad acceptance by consumers and businesses of a wide variety of interactive television products 
demand and market acceptance of recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and  as a result  our profit potential is unproven 
in addition  the potential size of this new market opportunity and the timing of its development and deployment are currently uncertain 
development schedules of interactive television offered by our competitors have been delayed or refocused as the industry evolves 
if the market for interactive television does not develop or develops more slowly than anticipated  our revenues will not grow as fast as anticipated  if at all 
competition may increase in the interactive television industry the number of competitors in the game portion of the interactive television industry may increase as the industry matures 
some of those competitors may be larger and better capitalized than we are 
the adoption of incompatible standards could render our products obsolete or non competitive 
if a new digital set top box standard or middleware platform is defined  we do not know whether buzztime s products will be compatible with such standards once defined 
the establishment of multiple standards could hurt our business and significantly increase our expenses  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
any delay or failure on our part to respond quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our existing products and services obsolete and cause us not to be competitive  resulting in a decrease in our revenues without a corresponding decrease in our expenses 
we may have to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our products or services to respond to these developments 
we must be able to incorporate new technologies into the products we design and develop in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base 
increasing government regulation could cause demand for our products and services to decline significantly 
we are subject not only to regulations applicable to businesses generally  but also laws and regulations that apply directly to the industry of interactive television products 
although there are currently few such laws and regulations  state and federal governments may adopt a number of these laws and regulations governing any of the following issues o user privacy  o copyrights  o consumer protection  o the media distribution of specific material or content  and o the characteristics and quality of interactive television products and services 
one or more states or the federal government could enact regulations aimed at companies  like us  which provide interactive television products 
the likelihood of such regulation being enacted will increase as interactive television becomes more pervasive and affects the daily lives of more people 
any such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth of the industry of interactive television 
if such a reduction in growth occurs  demand for our products and services may decline significantly 
on january   the federal communications commission issued a notice of inquiry concerning interactive television 
the notice raised a series of questions that suggest that cable systems might be regarded as essential  open platforms of spectrum for non discriminatory third party access  rather than facilities based providers competing in a wider market 
the notice sought comments on the nature of interactive television and whether cable systems will be a superior platform for providing interactive television 
the outcome of the inquiry will determine whether or not a subsequent rulemaking will be held in order to create regulations for the interactive television industry 
any regulation of this industry could impact on buzztime and its operations 
risk factors associated with our common stock our common stock could be delisted or suspended from trading on the american stock exchange 
on may   we received a letter from the american stock exchange amex stating that we are now in compliance with amex listing standards 
prior to that date we had been out of compliance since our shareholders equity was below million  which was the minimum threshold established by amex for companies with multiple years of losses 
new amex rules effective january permit a company  such as ntn  to remain listed on amex if it has a total market capitalization of at least million  has at least million shares publicly held  has a market value of publicly held shares of at least million and has a minimum of round lot shareholders 
should  at some future date  we fall out of compliance with the new rules from subsequent changes in market capitalization or otherwise  we could remain compliant by maintaining a level of shareholders equity of million 
if we otherwise fail to maintain compliance with the amex listing standards  our common stock may not remain listed on amex or any other exchange or quotation system in the future 
if our common stock is delisted from amex  spreads can often be higher for securities traded on the over the counter market and the execution time for orders may be longer 
thus  removing our stock from amex may result in decreased liquidity by making the trading of our stock less efficient 
our stock price has been highly volatile and your investment could suffer a decrease in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for technology related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
our charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company  which could result in our inability to approve a change in control and potentially receive a premium over the current market value of your stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if such a change in control would benefit our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation requires a supermajority vote of at least of the total voting power  voting together as a single class  to amend certain provisions of such document  including those provisions relating to o the number  election and term of directors  o the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies  and o the supermajority voting requirements of our restated certificate of incorporation 
these provisions could discourage third parties from taking over control of our company 
such provisions may also impede a transaction in which you could receive a premium over then current market prices and your ability to approve a transaction that you consider in your best interests 
if the shares of our common stock eligible for future sale are sold  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the anticipation of such sales could have a material adverse effect on then prevailing market prices 
as of december   there were approximately  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
as of december   there were also outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the foregoing options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions  since the holders of these options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by such options and warrants 
for the life of such options and warrants  the holders are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership 
to the extent the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such options or warrants exceeds the exercise price  such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates  stock market fluctuations  and interest rates 
as of december   we owned common stock of an australian company that is subject to market risk 
at december   the carrying value of this investment was  which is net of a  unrealized loss 
this investment is exposed to further market risk in the future based on the operating results of the australian company and stock market fluctuations 
additionally  the value of the investment is further subject to changes in australian currency exchange rates 
at december   a hypothetical decline in the value of the australian dollar would result in a reduction of  in the carrying value of the investment 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
nor do we have any speculative or hedging instruments
