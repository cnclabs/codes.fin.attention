table of contents a holding company business prior to the covanta acquisition  danielson s strategy had been to grow by developing business partnerships and making strategic acquisitions 
following the covanta acquisition  danielson s strategy has been to concentrate on increasing value in covanta s core waste to energy business  while ensuring the nols at the danielson level are available to covanta as contemplated by the reorganization plan 
as of december   danielson had consolidated nols of approximately million 
this estimate was based upon federal consolidated income tax losses for the periods through december  and an estimate of the taxable results 
some or all of the carryforward may be available to offset  for federal income tax purposes  the future taxable income  if any  of danielson  its wholly owned subsidiaries and the mission trusts described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of danielson s tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nol carryforward were reported 
danielson s nols will expire  if not used  in the following approximate amounts in the following years in thousands of dollars amount of carryforward year expiring danielson s ability to utilize its nols would be substantially reduced if danielson were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
danielson will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a increase in stock ownership during a three year testing period by stockholders 
in an effort to reduce the risk of an ownership change  danielson has imposed restrictions on the ability of holders of five percent or more of the common stock  as well as the ability of others to become five percent stockholders as a result of transfers of common stock 
the transfer restrictions were implemented in  and danielson expects that they will remain in force as long as the nols are available to danielson 
notwithstanding such transfer restrictions  there could be circumstances under which an issuance by danielson of a significant number of new shares of common stock or other new class of equity security having certain characteristics for example  the right to vote or convert into common stock might result in an ownership change under the internal revenue code 
b energy services business see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

table of contents i domestic energy business covanta s domestic business is the design  construction and long term operation of key infrastructure for municipalities and others in waste to energy and independent power production 
covanta s largest operations are in waste to energy projects  and it currently operates waste to energy projects  the majority of which were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurements conducted by municipal entities 
the waste to energy plants combust municipal solid waste as a means of environmentally sound disposal and produce energy that is typically sold as electricity to utilities and other electricity purchasers 
covanta processes approximately four percent of the municipal solid waste produced in the united states and therefore represents a vital part of the nation s solid waste disposal industry 
waste to energy projects the essential purpose of covanta s waste to energy projects is to provide waste disposal services  typically to municipal clients who sponsor the projects client communities 
generally  covanta provides these services pursuant to long term service contracts service agreements 
the electricity or steam is sold pursuant to long term power purchase agreements energy contracts with local utilities or industrial customers  with one exception  and most of the resulting revenues reduce the overall cost of waste disposal services to the client communities 
each service agreement is different to reflect the specific needs and concerns of the client community  applicable regulatory requirements and other factors 
the original terms of the service agreements are each or more years  with the majority now in the second half of the applicable term 
most of covanta s service agreements may be renewed for varying periods of time  at the option of the client community 
covanta currently operates the waste to energy projects identified below under domestic project summaries 
most of covanta s operating waste to energy projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement conducted by municipal entities 
as a result  these projects have many common features  which are described in structurally similar waste to energy projects below 
certain projects which do not follow this model  or have been or may be restructured  are described in other waste to energy project structures and project restructurings during below 
covanta receives its revenue in the form of fees pursuant to service agreements  and in some cases energy contracts  at facilities it owns 
covanta s service agreements begin to expire in  and energy contracts at company owned projects generally expire at or after the date on which that project s service agreement expires 
as covanta s contracts expire it will become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its service agreements at municipally owned facilities expire  covanta intends to seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to operate several such facilities 
covanta also will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
as covanta s service agreements at facilities it owns begin to expire  it intends to seek replacement or additional contracts  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time covanta expects to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenues to covanta 
at company owned facilities  the expiration of existing energy contracts will require covanta to sell its output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that covanta will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to covanta 
covanta s opportunities for growth by investing in new projects will be limited by existing non project debt covenants  as well as by competition from other companies in the waste disposal business 
for a discussion of such debt covenants see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents structurally similar waste to energy projects each service agreement is different to reflect the specific needs and concerns of the client community  applicable regulatory requirements and other factors 
however  the following description sets forth terms that are generally common to these agreements covanta designs the facility  helps to arrange for financing and then constructs and equips the facility on a fixed price and schedule basis 
covanta operates the facility and generally guarantees it will meet minimum waste processing capacity and efficiency standards  energy production levels and environmental standards 
covanta s failure to meet these guarantees or to otherwise observe the material terms of the service agreement unless caused by the client community or by events beyond its control unforeseen circumstances may result in liquidated damages charged to covanta or  if the breach is substantial  continuing and unremedied  the termination of the service agreement 
in the case of such service agreement termination  covanta may be obligated to pay material damages  including payments to discharge project indebtedness 
covanta or an intermediate holding company typically guarantees performance of the service agreement 
the client community is generally required to deliver minimum quantities of municipal solid waste to the facility on a put or pay basis and is obligated to pay a service fee for its disposal the service fee 
a put or pay commitment means that the client community promises to deliver a stated quantity of waste and pay an agreed amount for its disposal 
this payment is due even if the counterparty delivers less than the full amount of waste promised 
portions of the service fee escalate to reflect indices of inflation 
in many cases the client community must also pay for other costs  such as insurance  taxes and transportation and disposal of the residue to the disposal site 
if the facility is owned by covanta  the client community also pays as part of the service fee an amount equal to the debt service due to be paid on the bonds issued to finance the facility 
generally  expenses resulting from the delivery of unacceptable and hazardous waste on the site are also borne by the client community 
in addition  the contracts generally require that the client community pay increased expenses and capital costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances  subject to limits which may be specified in the service agreement 
the client community usually retains a portion of the energy revenues generally generated by the facility  and pays the balance to covanta 
financing for covanta s domestic waste to energy projects is generally accomplished through tax exempt and taxable revenue bonds issued by or on behalf of the client community 
if the facility is owned by a covanta subsidiary  the client community loans the bond proceeds to the subsidiary to pay for facility construction and pays to the subsidiary amounts necessary to pay debt service 
for such facilities  project related debt is included as project debt short and long term in covanta s consolidated financial statements 
generally  such debt is secured by the revenues pledged under the respective indentures and is collateralized by the assets of covanta s subsidiary with the only recourse to covanta being related to construction and operating performance defaults 
covanta has issued instruments to its client communities and other parties which guarantee that covanta s operating subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms including  where required  the payment of damages 
such contractual damages could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
for facilities owned by client communities and operated by covanta subsidiaries  covanta s potential maximum liability as of december  associated with the repayment of project debt on such facilities was in excess of billion 
if covanta is asked to perform under one or more of such guarantees  its liability for damages upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt which is presently not estimable 
to date  covanta has not incurred material liabilities under such guarantees 

table of contents other waste to energy project structures haverhill  massachusetts covanta s haverhill  massachusetts waste to energy facility is not operated pursuant to a service agreement with a client community 
in this project  covanta assumed the project debt and risks relating to waste availability and pricing  risks relating to the continued performance of the electricity purchaser  as well as risks associated with unforeseen circumstances 
covanta retains all of the energy revenues from sales of power and disposal fees for waste accepted at this facility 
accordingly  covanta believes that this project carries both greater risks and greater potential rewards than projects in which there is a client community 
during  us gen new england  inc usgenne  the power purchaser for the haverhill project  filed a petition under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
during the pendency of its bankruptcy  on october   the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland entered an order approving the sale by usgenne of certain of its assets  including its contract to purchase power from the haverhill project  to dominion energy new england  inc dominion 
as a result of usgenne s sale to dominion  usgenne assigned and dominion assumed such contract and covanta was paid all outstanding prepetition cure amounts plus interest 
union  new jersey in union county  new jersey  a municipally owned facility has been leased to covanta  and the client community has agreed to deliver approximately of the facility s capacity on a put or pay basis 
the balance of facility capacity is marketed by covanta at its risk 
covanta guarantees its subsidiary s contractual obligations to operate and maintain the facility  and on one series of subordinated bonds  its obligations to make lease payments which are the sole source for payment of principal and interest on that series of bonds 
as of december   the current outstanding principal amount of the subordinated bonds  sold to refinance a portion of the original bonds used to finance the facility  was million 
as a part of restructuring of this project  the client community assigned to covanta the long term power contract with the local utility 
as part of this assignment  the power contract was amended to give covanta the right to sell all or a portion of the plant s output to other purchasers 
since april  covanta has sold the majority of its output directly into the regional electricity grid at market pricing with the remainder of the electricity sold under short term contract when covanta may enter into contracts with other purchasers if it believes doing so would enhance this project s revenues 
alexandria  virginia covanta s alexandria  virginia waste to energy facility is operated pursuant to a service agreement with the city of alexandria  virginia and arlington county  virginia and authorities established by those communities the virginia communities 
the virginia communities pay a fixed tip fee  subject to certain adjustments  for each ton of waste they are required to deliver on a put or pay basis about of the facility s capacity 
the balance of the waste is obtained by covanta from private haulers pursuant to short term contracts or on a spot basis 
covanta s operating subsidiary receives all of the electricity revenues received under the facility s power sales agreement and pays the debt service on the bonds issued to finance the facility 
the service agreement provides that if income available for debt service  as calculated in accordance with the service agreement  does not cover debt service  the virginia communities will loan covanta s operating subsidiary the amount of the shortfall 
any such loan is required to be repaid from the project s positive cash flow in succeeding years and would have an ultimate maturity in the interest rate on any such loan is six percent 
since the alexandria facility began operating in  the virginia communities have been required to extend such loans on four occasions  the last of which was with respect to the operating year ending june  all such loans have been fully repaid within six months  and as of december  there were currently no outstanding loans to covanta s operating subsidiary 

table of contents project restructurings during babylon  new york the town of babylon  new york babylon filed a proof of claim against covanta babylon  inc covanta babylon in its bankruptcy proceeding for approximately million in prepetition damages and million in postpetition damages  alleging that covanta babylon has accepting less waste than required under the service agreement between babylon and covanta babylon at the waste to energy facility in babylon and that covanta babylon s chapter cases imposed on babylon additional costs for which covanta babylon should be responsible 
covanta filed an objection to babylon s claim  asserting that it was in full compliance with the express requirements of the service agreement and was entitled to adjust the amount of waste it is required to accept to reflect the energy content of the waste delivered 
covanta babylon also asserted that the costs arising from its chapter proceedings are not recoverable by babylon 
after lengthy discussions  babylon and covanta babylon reached a settlement pursuant to which  in part  i the parties amended the service agreement to adjust covanta babylon s operational procedures for accepting waste  reduce covanta babylon s waste processing obligations  increase babylon s additional waste service fee to covanta babylon and reduce babylon s annual operating and maintenance fee to covanta babylon  ii covanta babylon paid a specified amount to babylon in consideration for a release of any and all claims other than its rights under the settlement documents that babylon may hold against the covanta and in satisfaction of babylon s administrative expense claims against covanta babylon  and iii the parties allocated additional costs relating to the project s swap financing as a result of covanta babylon s chapter proceedings until such costs are eliminated 
covanta babylon subsequently emerged from chapter pursuant to the reorganization plan as described below on march   and the restructuring became effective on march  lake county  florida in late  lake county  florida lake county commenced a lawsuit in florida state court against covanta lake  inc covanta lake  relating to the waste to energy facility operated by covanta in lake county  florida the lake facility 
in the lawsuit  lake county sought to have its service agreement with covanta lake declared void and in violation of the florida constitution 
that lawsuit was stayed by the commencement of the chapter cases 
lake county subsequently filed a proof of claim seeking in excess of million from covanta lake and covanta 
after months of negotiations that failed to produce a settlement between covanta lake and lake county  on june   covanta lake filed a motion with the bankruptcy court seeking entry of an order i authorizing covanta lake to assume  effective upon confirmation of a plan of reorganization for covanta lake  its service agreement with lake county  ii finding no cure amounts due under the service agreement  and iii seeking a declaration that the service agreement is valid  enforceable and constitutional and remains in full force and effect 
contemporaneously with the filing of the assumption motion  covanta lake filed an adversary complaint asserting that lake county is in arrears to covanta lake in the amount of more than million 
shortly before trial commenced in these matters  covanta and lake county reached a tentative settlement calling for a new agreement specifying the parties obligations and restructuring of the project 
that tentative settlement and the proposed restructuring involved  among other things  termination of the existing service agreement and the execution of a new waste disposal agreement which provides for a put or pay obligation on lake county s part to deliver  tons per year of acceptable waste to the lake facility and a different fee structure  a replacement guarantee from covanta in a reduced amount  the payment by lake county of all amounts due as pass through costs with respect to covanta lake s payment of property taxes  the payment by lake county of a specified amount in  and in reimbursement of certain capital costs  the settlement of all pending litigation  and a refinancing of the existing bonds 
the lake settlement was contingent upon  among other things  receipt of all necessary approvals  as well as a favorable outcome to the debtors separate objection to the proof of claims filed by f 
browne gregg  a third party claiming an interest in the existing service agreement that would be terminated under the 
table of contents proposed settlement 
in august  the bankruptcy court ruled on the debtors claims objections  finding in favor of the debtors 
based on the foregoing  the debtors determined to propose a plan of reorganization for covanta lake 
the debtors subsequently reached a final settlement with mr 
gregg  entered into a new long term waste disposal agreement with lake county on terms substantially similar to the tentative settlement  refinanced the project debt and confirmed the covanta lake plan of reorganization in december covanta lake emerged from bankruptcy on december  warren county  new jersey the covanta subsidiary covanta warren which operates covanta s waste to energy facility in warren county  new jersey the warren facility and the pollution control financing authority of warren county warren authority have been engaged in negotiations for an extended time concerning a potential restructuring of the parties rights and obligations under various agreements related to covanta warren s operation of the warren facility 
those negotiations were in part precipitated by a federal court of appeals decision invalidating certain of the state of new jersey s waste flow laws  which resulted in significantly reduced revenues for the warren facility 
since  the state of new jersey has been voluntarily making all debt service payments with respect to the project bonds issued to finance construction of the warren facility  and covanta warren has been operating the warren facility pursuant to an agreement with the warren authority which modifies the existing service agreement for the warren facility 
although discussions continue  to date covanta warren and the warren authority have been unable to reach an agreement to restructure the contractual arrangements governing covanta warren s operation of the warren facility 
based upon the foregoing  covanta has not yet determined to propose a plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation for covanta warren at this time  and instead has determined that covanta warren should remain a debtor in possession 
in order to emerge from bankruptcy without uncertainty concerning potential claims against covanta related to the warren facility  covanta rejected its guarantees of covanta warren s obligations relating to the operation and maintenance of the warren facility 
covanta anticipates that if a restructuring is consummated  covanta may at that time issue a new parent guarantee in connection with that restructuring and emergence from bankruptcy 
in the event the parties are unable to timely reach agreement upon and consummate a restructuring of the contractual arrangements governing covanta warren s operation of the warren facility  covanta may  among other things  elect to litigate with counterparties to certain agreements with covanta warren  assume or reject one or more executory contracts related to the warren facility  attempt to file a plan of reorganization on a non consensual basis  or liquidate covanta warren 
in such an event  creditors of covanta warren may not receive any recovery on account of their claims 
covanta expects that the outcome of this restructuring will not negatively affect its ability to implement its business plan or have a material impact on its operating results and financial position

covanta currently owns  has ownership in and operates such facilities 
the electrical output from each facility  with one exception  is sold to local utilities 
covanta s revenue from the independent power production facilities is derived primarily from the sale of energy and capacity under energy contracts 
during  covanta sold its interests in its geothermal energy project business 
the regulatory framework for selling power to utilities from independent power facilities including waste to energy facilities after current contracts expire is in flux  given the energy crisis in california in and  the over capacity of generation at the present time in many markets and the uncertainty as to the adoption of new federal energy legislation 
various states and congress are considering a wide variety of changes to regulatory frameworks  but none has been established definitively at present

covanta energy group  inc guaranteed ctc s performance under its construction contract with tbw 
a separate subsidiary  covanta tampa bay  inc ctb  entered into a contract with tbw to operate the tampa water facility after construction and testing is completed by ctc 
as construction of the tampa water facility neared completion  the parties had material disputes between them 
these disputes led to tbw issuing a default notice to ctc and shortly thereafter ctc filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
in february  covanta and tbw reached a tentative compromise of their disputes which was approved by the bankruptcy court 
on july   the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of reorganization for ctc and ctb  which incorporated the terms of the settlement between covanta and tbw 
that plan became effective on august  when ctc and ctb emerged from bankruptcy 
after payment of certain creditor claims under the ctc and ctb plan  covanta realized approximately million of the proceeds from the settlement with tbw

covanta owned this project from until its sale in the fourth quarter of covanta continues to operate the project under an contract expiring in ii international energy business covanta conducts its international energy businesses through covanta power international holdings  inc cpih and its subsidiaries 
internationally  the largest element of covanta s energy business is its ownership in and operation of the mw net pulverized coal fired electrical generating facility in quezon province  the philippines 
covanta has interests in other fossil fuel generating projects in asia  a waste to energy project in italy and two small hydroelectric projects in costa rica 
in general  these projects provide returns primarily from equity distributions and  to a lesser extent  operating fees 
the projects sell the electricity and steam they generate under long term contracts or market concessions to utilities  governmental agencies providing power distribution  creditworthy industrial users  or local governmental units 
in select cases  such sales of electricity and steam may be provided under short term arrangements as well 
similarly  covanta seeks to obtain long term contracts for fuel supply from reliable sources 
covanta presently has interests in international power projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately mw gross 
covanta s ownership in these facilities is approximately mw 
in addition to its headquarters in fairfield  new jersey  covanta s business is facilitated through field offices in shanghai  china  chennai  india  manila  the philippines  and bangkok  thailand 
in august  covanta sold its equity interest in a mw natural gas fired cogeneration project in the province of murcia  spain and terminated its operations and maintenance agreement for the facility 
in september  covanta solicited bids for the possible sale of its ownership and operating interests in its operating power projects in bangladesh  china and india 
indicative bids were received in october and following due diligence final bids were received in february in light of danielson s proposed acquisition of american ref fuel holdings corp  and the related repayment in full of the cpih corporate debt obligations  covanta has determined not to proceed with negotiating definitive agreements for the sale of these projects at this time 
see additional information below under recent developments regarding such refinancing 
general approach to international projects in developing its international businesses  covanta has employed the same general approach to projects as is described above with respect to domestic projects 
given its plan to refocus its business in domestic markets  no new international project development is anticipated at this time 
the ownership and operation of facilities in foreign countries in connection with covanta s international business entails significant political and financial uncertainties that typically are not encountered in such activities in the united states 
key international risk factors include governmentally sponsored efforts to renegotiate long term contracts  non payment of fees and other monies owed to covanta  unexpected changes in electricity tariffs  conditions in financial markets  changes in the markets for fuel  currency exchange rates  currency repatriation restrictions  currency convertibility  changes in laws and regulations and political  economic or military instability  civil unrest and expropriation 
such risks have the potential to cause material impairment to the value of covanta s international businesses 

table of contents many of the countries in which covanta operates are lesser developed countries or developing countries 
the political  social and economic conditions in some of these countries are typically less stable than those in the united states 
the financial condition and creditworthiness of the potential purchasers of power and services provided by covanta which may be a governmental or private utility or industrial consumer or of the suppliers of fuel for projects in these countries may not be as strong as those of similar entities in developed countries 
the obligations of the purchaser under the energy contract  the service recipient under the related service agreement and the supplier under the fuel supply agreement generally are not guaranteed by any host country or other creditworthy governmental agency 
at the time it develops a project  covanta undertakes a credit analysis of the proposed power purchaser or fuel supplier 
it also has sought  to the extent appropriate and achievable within the commercial parameters of a project  to require such entities to provide financial instruments such as letters of credit or arrangements regarding the escrowing of the receivables of such parties in the case of power purchasers 
covanta s power projects in particular depend on reliable and predictable delivery of fuel meeting the quantity and quality requirements of the project facilities 
covanta has typically sought to negotiate long term contracts for the supply of fuel with creditworthy and reliable suppliers 
however  the reliability of fuel deliveries may be compromised by one or more of several factors that may be more acute or may occur more frequently in developing countries than in developed countries  including a lack of sufficient infrastructure to support deliveries under all circumstances  bureaucratic delays in the import  transportation and storage of fuel in the host country  customs and tariff disputes  and local or regional unrest or political instability 
in most of the foreign projects in which covanta participates  it has sought  to the extent practicable  to shift the consequences of interruptions in the delivery of fuel whether due to the fault of the fuel supplier or due to reasons beyond the fuel supplier s control to the electricity purchaser or service recipient by securing a suspension of its operating responsibilities under the applicable agreements and an extension of its operating concession under such agreements 
in some instances  covanta requires the energy purchaser or service recipient to continue to make payments in respect of fixed costs if such interruptions occur 
in order to mitigate the effect of short term interruptions in the supply of fuel  covanta has also endeavored to provide on site storage of fuel in sufficient quantities to address such interruptions 
payment for services that covanta provides will often be made in whole or part in the domestic currencies of the host countries 
conversion of such currencies into us dollars generally is not assured by a governmental or other creditworthy country agency and may be subject to limitations in the currency markets  as well as restrictions of the host country 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of such currencies against the value of the us dollar may cause covanta s participation in such projects to yield less return than expected 
transfer of earnings and profits in any form beyond the borders of the host country may be subject to special taxes or limitations imposed by host country laws 
covanta has sought to participate in projects in jurisdictions where limitations on the convertibility and expatriation of currency have been lifted by the host country and where such local currency is freely exchangeable on the international markets 
in most cases  components of project costs incurred or funded in the currency of the united states are recovered without risk of currency fluctuation through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation  and consequently there is risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 
covanta has sought to manage and mitigate these risks through all means that it deems appropriate  including political and financial analysis of the host countries and the key participants in each project  guarantees of relevant agreements with creditworthy entities  political risk and other forms of insurance  participation by united states and or international development finance institutions in the financing of projects in which covanta participates  and joint ventures with other companies to pursue the development  financing and construction of these projects 
covanta determines which mitigation measurers to apply based on its balancing of the risk presented  the availability of such measures and their cost 
in addition  covanta has generally participated in projects which provide services that are treated as a matter of national or key economic importance by the laws and politics of the host country 
there is therefore 
table of contents a risk that the assets constituting the facilities of these projects could be temporarily or permanently expropriated or nationalized by a host country  made subject to local or national control or be subject to unfavorable legislative action  regulatory decisions or changes in taxation 
in certain cases  covanta has issued guarantees of its operating subsidiaries contractual obligations to operate certain international power projects 
the potential damages owed under such arrangements for international projects may be material if called 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such domestic and international damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than covanta s then available sources of funds 
to date  covanta has not incurred any material liabilities under its guarantees on international projects 
the following is a description of covanta s international power projects by fuel type waste to energy during  covanta acquired a equity interest in an mw mass burn waste to energy project at trezzo sull adda in the lombardy region of italy which burns up to metric tons per day of municipal solid waste

the project is now in its third year of operation 
there was a significant delay in starting up the plant after construction was complete due to a legal action by an environmental group that has subsequently been overturned 
operation and maintenance of the plant by a was scheduled to commence in the third quarter of but has been delayed due to a dispute between the owner and operator as to the validity of the operations and maintenance agreement 
arbitration proceedings have commenced to settle the dispute

the tneb s obligations are guaranteed by the government of the state of tamil nadu 
indian oil corporation  ltd 
supplies the oil requirements of the project through year fuel supply agreement based on market prices 
disputing several tariff provisions  the tneb has failed to pay the full amount due under the energy contracts for both the samalpatti and madurai projects 
similar to many indian state electricity boards  the tneb has also failed to fund the escrow account or post letter of credit required under the project energy contracts  which failure constitutes a default under the project finance documents 
the project lenders for both projects have not declared an event of default due to this matter and have permitted continued distributions of project dividends 
to date  the tneb has paid the undisputed portion of its payment obligations approximately representing each project s operating costs  fuel costs  debt service and some equity return 
project lenders for both projects have either granted periodic waivers of such default or potential default and or otherwise approved scheduled equity distributions 
neither such default nor potential default in the project financing arrangements constitutes a default under cpih s recourse debt 
further  during cpih was able to refinance a significant portion of the original project debt for both projects 
while the tenor and the covenants remain the same  each project has been able to lower its interest costs substantially  resulting in reduced tariffs to the tneb 
the tneb has indicated a desire to renegotiate tariffs for both project energy contracts  and it is possible that the issue of the escrow account or letter of credit requirement will be resolved as part of any such process 
covanta owns interests in three diesel fuel facilities in the philippines 
the bataan cogeneration project is an inactive moth balled mw facility that is owned by covanta 
due to the inability to obtain a profitable power off take agreement for this project following the june expiration of its principal off take agreement  the project company in august exercised its option to pre terminate its remaining loss producing off take agreement and ceased operations 
covanta has determined to auction off the physical assets 
such auction is anticipated to occur upon receipt of governmental approvals 
covanta previously wrote off its investment in this project in covanta owns a minority interest in the island power project  a mw facility that has a long term power contract with the national power corporation 
covanta does not believe its equity interest in this project has any value and in wrote off its investment 
this project is not operated by covanta 
covanta is exploring means of divesting its interest in this facility to the holders of the majority interest 
it is uncertain at this time whether covanta would realize any value from such a sale 
a subsidiary of covanta owns and operates the magellan cogeneration project  a mw diesel fired electric generating facility in the province of cavite  the philippines 
this project sells a portion of its energy and capacity to the national power corporation and a portion to the philippine economic zone authority the authority pursuant to long term energy contracts 
on january   the authority  the main power off taker for this project  served the project with notice of termination of the energy contract for alleged non performance by the project 
covanta disagrees with this assertion and has sought a court injunction against termination of the energy contract and to require arbitration of the dispute which involves alleged non reliable operations and alleged improper substitution of national power corporation power for magellan production 
on february   the regional trial court  national capital judicial region  branch  pasay city 
table of contents issued a temporary restraining order barring the authority from terminating the energy contract 
on april  after a series of hearings  such court replaced such temporary restraining order with a preliminary injunction 
such preliminary injunction restrains the authority from terminating the energy contract until such time as the merits of the case are resolved 
if such case were ultimately to be decided in favor of the authority  the project would lose not only the energy contract but also that portion of the plant site under lease from the authority as such lease is tied to the energy contract 
due to high fuel pricing and low tariff conditions  project revenues were insufficient to cover both operating costs and debt service beyond the second quarter of as a result  on may   the magellan project company filed a petition for corporate rehabilitation under philippine law 
on june   the regional trial court  fourth judicial region  branch  imus  cavite issued a stay order enjoining creditors from pursuing collection of pre petition debts and ordering suppliers to continue supplying goods and services in exchange for prompt payment 
in addition  a rehabilitation receiver was appointed 
on august   the same regional trial court issued a due course order finding the rehabilitation petition to have sufficient merit to proceed 
the rehabilitation receiver submitted his comments to the proposed rehabilitation plan and an alternative rehabilitation plan in january the final rehabilitation plan may provide for debt forgiveness  a debt equity swap  a reduction in interest rate and or an extension of the debt tenor 
covanta wrote off its investment in this project in international project dispositions on august   the company sold its ownership interest in an approximately mw industrial cogeneration facility located in murcia  spain

iii description of covanta reorganization and related dispositions of assets covanta s domestic and international businesses were reorganized when they emerged from bankruptcy on march  and covanta became a wholly owned subsidiary of danielson 
covanta s chapter proceedings commenced on april  the first petition date  when covanta and most of its domestic subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the bankruptcy court 
all of the bankruptcy cases the chapter cases were jointly administered under the caption in re ogden new york services  inc  et al  case nos 
cb  et al 
as debtors in possession  covanta and its subsidiaries that were part of the chapter cases the debtors were authorized to continue to operate as an ongoing business 
in order to obtain post petition financing  with the approval of the bankruptcy court  the debtors entered into a debtor in possession credit agreement dated as of april  with several financial institutions as amended  the dip financing facility with the debtors prepetition bank lenders the dip lenders 
over the course of the chapter cases  the debtors disposed of all remaining interests in their entertainment and aviation businesses 
the debtors also held discussions with the official committee of unsecured creditors the creditors committee  representatives of the debtors prepetition bank lenders and other lenders the dip lenders and together with the company s pre petition bank lenders  the 
table of contents secured bank lenders under the dip financing facility  as discussed below  and the holders of covanta s debentures with respect to possible capital and debt structures for the debtors and the formulation of a plan of reorganization 
in connection with such discussion  it was determined to be in the best interests of the debtors estates to dispose of covanta s geothermal project businesses  which was effected in december on december   covanta and danielson entered into an investment and purchase agreement dated december  as amended  the danielson agreement 
the danielson agreement provided for danielson to purchase of the shares of reorganized covanta new common for million as part of a plan of reorganization the danielson transaction  agreement as to new revolving credit and letter of credit facilities for covanta s domestic and international operations  provided by certain of the secured bank lenders and a group of additional lenders organized by danielson  and execution and consummation of a tax sharing agreement between danielson and reorganized covanta the tax sharing agreement  pursuant to which covanta s share of danielson s consolidated group tax liability for taxable years ending after consummation of the danielson transaction will be computed taking into account danielson s net operating losses nols generated before january  to the extent not utilized by any other existing member of the consolidated group  and danielson will have an obligation to indemnify and hold harmless covanta for certain excess tax liability 
the debtors determined that the danielson transaction was in the best interests of their estates and their creditors and was preferable to other alternatives under consideration because it provided a more favorable capital structure for the debtors upon emergence from chapter  the injection of million in equity from danielson  enhanced access to capital markets through danielson  diminished syndication risk in connection with the reorganized debtors financing under the exit financing agreements  and reduced exposure of the secured bank lenders as a result of financing arranged by new lenders 
on march   the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the debtors plans of reorganization premised on the danielson transaction and liquidation for certain of those debtors involved in non core businesses the liquidation plan collectively with the plan of reorganization  the reorganization plan  and on march  both plans were effected upon the consummation of the danielson transaction the plans of reorganization and liquidation collectively  the reorganization plan

during  covanta s subsidiaries involved with the tampa bay project and the lake county project emerged from bankruptcy under separate reorganization plans 
covanta s subsidiaries involved with the warren county project remain in bankruptcy 
the reorganization plan provided for  among other things  the following distributions i secured bank lender and debenture holder claims on account of their allowed secured claims  the secured bank lenders and the debenture holders received  in the aggregate  a distribution consisting of the cash available for distribution after payment by the debtors of exit costs necessary to confirm the reorganization plan and establishment of required reserves pursuant to the reorganization plan  new high yield secured notes issued by covanta and guaranteed by its subsidiaries other than cpih and its subsidiaries which are not contractually prohibited from incurring or guaranteeing additional 
table of contents debt covanta and such subsidiaries  the domestic borrowers with a stated maturity of seven years the high yield notes  and a term loan of cpih with a stated maturity of three years 
additionally  the reorganization plan incorporates the terms of a settlement of litigation that had commenced during the chapter cases by the creditors committee challenging the validity of the lien asserted on behalf of the holders of the debentures the debenture adversary proceeding 
pursuant to the settlement  holders of general unsecured claims against covanta are entitled to receive of the value that would otherwise be distributable to the holders of debenture claims that participate in the settlement 
ii unsecured claims against operating company subsidiaries the holders of allowed unsecured claims against any of covanta s operating subsidiaries will receive new unsecured notes in a principal amount equal to the amount of their allowed unsecured claims with a stated maturity of eight years the unsecured notes

as described above  pursuant to the reorganization plan  each holder of an allowed unsecured claim against covanta or certain of its holding company subsidiaries is entitled to receive its pro rata share of of the value that would otherwise be distributable to the holders of debenture claims that participate in the settlement of the debenture adversary proceeding pursuant to the reorganization plan 
iv subordinated claims of holders of convertible subordinated debentures the holders of covanta s convertible subordinated debentures and its subordinated debentures together  the convertible subordinated debentures neither received distributions nor retained any property pursuant to the reorganization plan 
the convertible subordinated debentures were cancelled as of march  v equity interests of old common and old preferred stockholders the holders of equity interests of covanta s old preferred and old common shares outstanding immediately before consummation of the danielson transaction received no distribution and retained no property pursuant to the reorganization plan 
the old preferred and old common shares were cancelled as of march  the liquidation plan provided for the complete liquidation of those of covanta s subsidiaries that have been designated as liquidating entities 
substantially all of the assets of these liquidating entities have already been sold 
under the liquidation plan the creditors of the liquidating entities will not receive any distribution other than those administrative creditors with respect to claims against the liquidating entities that have been incurred in the implementation of the liquidation plan and priority claims required to be paid under the bankruptcy code 
as further set forth in this part  item business and part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  there are risks that might affect covanta s ability to implement its business plan and pay the various debt instruments that were issued pursuant to the reorganization plan 

table of contents as a result of the consummation of the danielson transaction  covanta emerged from bankruptcy with a new debt structure 
domestic borrowers have two credit facilities a letter of credit facility the first lien facility  for the issuance of letters of credit required in connection with one waste to energy facility  the current aggregate amount of which was approximately million at december   and a letter of credit and liquidity facility the second lien facility  in the aggregate amount of million of which approximately million was outstanding at december   up to million of which shall also be available for cash borrowings on a revolving basis and the balance for letters of credit 
through december   cpih had not sought to make draws on this facility and the outstanding commitment amount has been reduced to million 
both facilities expire on march  and are secured by the assets of the domestic borrowers not otherwise pledged 
the lien of the second lien facility is junior to that of the first lien facility 
the domestic borrowers also issued the high yield notes and issued or will issue the unsecured notes 
the high yield notes are secured by a third priority lien in the same collateral securing the first lien facility and the second lien facility 
the high yield notes were issued in the initial principal amount of million  which will accrete to million at maturity in years 
the current accreted amount of the high yield notes was approximately million at december  unsecured notes in a principal amount of million were issued on the effective date of the reorganization plan 
covanta issued additional unsecured notes in a principal amount of million after emergence and recorded additional unsecured notes in a principal amount of million in which it expects to issue in the final principal amount of all unsecured notes will be equal to the amount of allowed unsecured claims against covanta s operating subsidiaries which were reorganizing debtors  and such amount will be determined at such time as the allowance of all such claims are resolved through settlement or further proceedings in the bankruptcy court 
notwithstanding the date on which unsecured notes are issued  interest on the unsecured notes accrues from march  also  cpih and each of its domestic subsidiaries  which hold all of the assets and operations of covanta s international businesses the cpih borrowers entered into two secured credit facilities a revolving credit facility  secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the cpih borrowers assets not otherwise pledged  consisting of commitments for cash borrowings in the initial amount of up to million  which remained undrawn at december   for purposes of supporting the international businesses  and a term loan facility of up to million  the outstanding amount of which approximately million was outstanding at december   secured by a second priority lien on the same collateral 
both facilities will mature in march the debt of the cpih borrowers is non recourse to covanta and its other domestic subsidiaries 
for further discussion  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
in addition  in the chapter cases  the debtors had the right  subject to bankruptcy court approval and certain other limitations  to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases 
as a condition to assuming a contract  each debtor was required to cure all existing defaults including payment defaults 
covanta paid approximately million in cure amounts in connection with assumed executory contracts and unexpired leases c insurance services business following the acquisition of covanta  the relative contribution of danielson s insurance services business to danielson s cash flow and its relative percentage of danielson s financial obligations were significantly reduced 
consequently  unlike prior years  danielson s insurance services business neither contributes materially to danielson s cash flow nor imposes material financial obligations on danielson 

table of contents the insurance services business  however  continues to represent an important element of danielson s structure in that danielson s nols were in part generated through the operations of former subsidiaries of danielson indemnity company dind 
danielson s ability to utilize that portion of the nols will depend upon the continued inclusion of its insurance services business in danielson s consolidated federal tax return 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on danielson s nols 
as discussed more fully below  danielson s insurance services businesses have succeeded in reducing losses by tightening underwriting criteria  exiting unprofitable lines of business and focusing on writing more profitable lines of business through its expanded arrangement with scj insurance services scj 
discussion of business danielson s insurance operations are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries 
national american insurance company of california naicc  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of danielson through dind  is danielson s principal operating insurance subsidiary 
naicc  in turn  is the sole stockholder of valor insurance company  incorporated  a montana domiciled specialty insurance company valor  danielson insurance company dico and danielson national insurance company dnic 
unless otherwise specified or the context requires otherwise  references to naicc include naicc and its subsidiaries 
naicc has historically managed its business across four principal lines of business non standard private passenger automobile  commercial automobile  workers compensation  and property and casualty 
however  as of december   naicc was engaged in writing exclusively non standard private passenger automobile primarily in california 
insurers admitted in california are required to obtain approval from the california department of insurance cdoi of rates and or forms prior to being used 
many of the other states  in which naicc does business  have similar requirements 
rates and policy forms are developed by naicc and filed with the regulators in each of the relevant states  depending upon each state s requirements 
naicc relies upon its own as well as industry experience in establishing rates 
naicc began writing non standard private passenger automobile insurance in california in july through scj and endeavored to write additional personal automobile programs beginning in in other territories  but due to underwriting losses  ceased writing such additional policies in march non standard risks are those segments of the driving public which generally are not considered preferred business  such as drivers with a record of prior accidents or driving violations  drivers involved in particular occupations or driving certain types of vehicles  or those who drivers whose policies have not been renewed or declined by another insurance company 
generally  in order to address the associated higher risk or non standard private automobile insurance  their premium rates are higher than standard premium rates while policy limits are lower than typical policy limits 
policyholder selection is governed by underwriting guidelines established by naicc 
management believes that it is able to achieve underwriting success through refinement of various risk profiles  thereby dividing the non standard market into more defined segments which can be adequately priced 
additionally  traditional lower policy limits lend themselves to quicker claims processing allowing management to respond more quickly to changing loss trends  by revising revised underlying underwriting guidelines and class and rate filings accordingly 
private passenger automobile policy limits vary by state 
in california non standard policies primarily provide maximum coverage up to the statutory minimum of  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage 
net written premiums were million  million and million in  and  respectively  for the non standard private passenger automobile program 
the primary reason for the continued decrease in private passenger automobile premiums in and were internally imposed underwriting restrictions placed on the california non standard automobile program in february 
table of contents however  in november  naicc lifted its moratorium on the non standard personal automobile program after receiving approval from cdoi for a new rate and class plan filing that is offered by dnic through scj 
as a result of the favorable underwriting results in the non standard personal automobile market  coupled with low premium leverage on its surplus  naicc has retained of the underlying risk of this program since commencing in january  naicc and dnic began to reinsure  on a quota share basis  and  respectively of its underlying risk with an am best a rated reinsurer 
the new reinsurance program was sought to address premium growth ratio guidelines established by the insurance regulation information system iris and the relative uncertainty of the underwriting results of the new program 
naicc does not write any business through managing general agents 
scj is responsible for all of the marketing  underwriting and policy administration for the non standard personal automobile policies in california 
scj does not have rate making authority nor can it bind reinsurance on behalf of naicc and dnic 
in return scj receives a flat commission on new and renewal policies written and participates in an incentive compensation arrangement dictated solely by underwriting results 
commercial automobile naicc began writing non standard commercial automobile insurance in through independent agents and ceased writing new policies in july in september  naicc began providing day statutory notification to non renew all in force policies 
as a result  as of september  there was no further loss exposure on this line 
the majority of automobiles owned or used by businesses are insured under policies that provide other coverage for the business  such as commercial multi peril insurance 
the policies issued by naicc were generally to businesses that were unable to insure a specific driver and businesses having vehicles not qualifying for commercial multi peril insurance 
the typical naicc commercial automobile policy covered fleets of four or fewer vehicles 
naicc did not insure interstate trucking  trucks hauling logs  gasoline or similar higher hazard operations 
the maximum non standard commercial automobile policy limit provided by naicc was million for bodily injury and property damage combined as a single limit of liability for each occurrence 
naicc retained the first million of bodily injury and property damage combined as a single limit of liability for each occurrence 
net written premiums for commercial automobile insurance were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in commercial automobile premiums in and was attributable to naicc s decision to exit this line of business 
the decision to exit the market was primarily driven by the unprofitable historical underwriting results  lack of surplus capacity and relatively high net retentions for this line of business 
workers compensation naicc began writing workers compensation insurance in and ceased writing policies in january in response to adverse market developments and loss experience 
through january  naicc and its subsidiary valor wrote workers compensation insurance primarily in california and montana 
naicc previously wrote workers compensation insurance in california and four other western states 
workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage for statutory benefits which employers are required to pay to employees who are injured in the course of employment including  among other things  temporary or permanent disability benefits  death benefits  medical and hospital expenses and expenses for vocational rehabilitation 
policies were issued having a term of no more than one year 
the last california workers compensation policy was issued in july and the last policy issued outside of california was issued in january valor began non renewing all policies in december and was placed into run off effective january prior to april  naicc retained the first million of each workers compensation loss and purchased reinsurance for up to million in excess of its retention  the first million of which has been placed with three major reinsurance companies with the remaining million provided by other 
table of contents companies

naicc has purchased reinsurance up to a million limit  net of its own retention 
the first million limit was placed with three major reinsurance companies with the remaining million limit provided by other companies 
net written premiums for workers compensation were nil  million and million in  and  respectively 
these decreases reflected naicc s and valor s exit from the market 
property and casualty as of december   naicc through a series of assumption agreements assumed the assets and liabilities of the stuyvesant insurance company stuyvesant for policies issued prior to  along with then other affiliated hf ahmanson insurance subsidiaries collectively referred as hf ahmanson 
naicc was subsequently acquired by kcp holding company kcp on september  on july   mission american insurance company maic pursuant to an assumption agreement transferred all of its assets and liabilities accident years through to naicc in exchange for of kcp s total common stock 
maic was part of the mission insurance group  inc  which subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on august  as a predecessor of danielson 
on december   danielson s predecessor acquired the remaining outstanding shares of kcp  not then indirectly owned by danielson  through its ownership of maic 
naicc for the years to wrote a commercial multi peril program for artisan contractors  and separately  a homeowners program from to naicc continues to discharge claims arising under its own insurance policies and contracts and those issued by maic  stuyvesant and other hf ahmanson former insurance affiliates 
the property and casualty claims are categorized as follows direct excess and primary policies  workers compensation  reinsurance assumed on an excess of loss basis  and reinsurance assumed on pool business primarily from the london marketplace 
substantially all remaining claims on policies  issued by companies other than by naicc  are of an asbestos and environmental a e nature 
as of december   there remained direct excess and primary claims  of which were related to policies issued by stuyvesant  by hf ahmanson entities  by maic and by naicc 
these claims generally had policy limits up to million with reinsurance generally above  naicc issued policies are approaching the year statute of limitations baring future claims acceptance 
as of december   there were open workers compensation claims  the majority of which were issued by maic with no reinsurance coverage 
the assumed reinsurance contracts had relatively low participation  generally less than  and estimates of unpaid losses have been based on information provided by the primary insurance companies 
at december   there were open claims related to excess of loss assumed reinsurance 
as of december  and  naicc s net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to a e claims were approximately million and million  respectively 
in the most current three years of development there has been an influx of newly reported a e cases on an excess of loss basis related to the stuyvesant issued policies that are beginning to pierce the limits in which naicc participates 
new cases reported in  and on the assumed excess of loss of business increased  and  respectively  however  the incurred losses  related to assumed excess of loss of business  were less than million for the last three years 
approximately of the aggregate assumed pool business has been reinsured  all with am best rated a or better carriers 
management has been successful in commuting with several cedants and pools with respect to the assumed liabilities and will continue to look for such opportunities in the future 

table of contents marketing naicc currently markets its non standard private passenger automobile insurance in california through scj who in turn uses over sub agents or retail brokers to obtain applications for policies

claims all automobile claims are handled by employees of naicc at its home office in long beach  california 
claims are reported by agents  insureds and claimants directly to naicc 
claims involving suspected fraud are referred to an in house special investigation unit siu which manages a detailed investigation of these claims using outside investigative firms 
when evidence of fraudulent activity is identified  the siu works with the various state departments of insurance  the national insurance crime bureau and local law enforcement agencies in handling the claims 
workers compensation claims have been consolidated and outsourced to a regional third party administrator  tristar risk management tristar effective july naicc transferred all of its files  to leverage tristar s medical fee discounts  including medical provider networks  operational size  supervision  and siu and quality assurance program on the remaining outstanding claims liability 
property and casualty claims are received  reviewed and processed by naicc employees located in long beach  california 
additionally  naicc uses external consultants and attorneys to aid in determining the extent  obligation and accuracy of claims originating from stuyvesant policies issued prior to losses and loss adjustment expenses naicc s net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae represent the estimated indemnity cost and expense necessary to cover the ultimate net cost of investigating and settling claims 
such estimates are based upon estimates for reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported by reinsured companies for insurance assumed and actuarial estimates based upon historical company and industry experience for development of reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported 
any changes in estimates of ultimate liability are reflected in current operating results 
inflation is assumed  along with other factors  in estimating future claim costs and related liabilities 
naicc does not discount any of its loss reserves 
the california legislature in response to rising workers compensation costs and a lack of available market  passed assembly bill no 
ab  senate bill no 
sb both signed on september   and senate bill no 
sb  effective april   all of which were signed by the governor 
these bills contain many reforms designed to reduce the cost of workers compensation claims 
several of the provisions apply to medical services provided after the effective dates  including services on injuries that occurred prior to the effective dates 
as a result  the reforms are expected to have a retroactive impact and therefore affect pre established reserve levels 
the six major provisions that could have a retroactive impact on naicc s reserves are changes to the official medical fee schedule values for physician services changes to the official medical fee schedule for inpatient services pharmaceutical fee schedule outpatient surgery center fee schedule repeal of the primary treating physician presumption for pre injuries other medical treatment utilization soon after the legislative changes became effective  naicc observed an increase in attempts to settle claims 
the ultimate loss and allocated lae alae estimates for naicc non valor workers 
table of contents compensation was reduced by million between and or approximately of the prior year reserves 
although the actuarial estimates did not explicitly factor the effect of the reforms  naicc believes that the favorable development were  in part  related to the new legislation 
the ultimate cost of claims is difficult to predict for several reasons 
claims may not be reported until many years after they are incurred 
changes in the rate of inflation and uncertainty in the legal environment may also create forecasting complications 
court decisions may dramatically increase liability in the time between the dates on which a claim is reported and its resolution 
for example  punitive damages awards have grown in frequency and magnitude 
courts have imposed increasing obligations on insurance companies to defend policyholders 
as a result  the frequency and severity of claims have grown rapidly and unpredictably 
the unpaid losses and lae  related to environmental cleanup  were established considering facts then currently known and the then current state of the law and coverage litigation 
liabilities are estimated for known claims including the cost of related litigation when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific contract of insurance or reinsurance and management can reasonably estimate its liability 
estimates for unknown claims and development on reported claims are included in naicc s unpaid losses and lae 
the liability for development of reported claims has been based on the estimates of the range of potential losses for reported claims in the aggregate 
estimates of liabilities are reviewed and updated continually and there is the potential that naicc s ultimate liabilities could be materially in excess of amounts that are currently recorded 
management believes  taking into account the opinions of independent actuarial professionals  that that the provisions for unpaid losses and lae are adequate to cover the net cost of losses and loss expenses incurred to date  however  such liability is necessarily based on estimates and there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed such estimates

the following table indicates the manner in which unpaid losses and lae at the end of a particular year change as time passes 
the first line reflects the liability as originally reported  net of reinsurance  at the end of the stated year 
each calendar year end liability includes the estimated liability for that accident year and all prior accident years comprising that liability 
the second section shows the original recorded net liability as of the end of successive years adjusted to reflect facts and circumstance that are later discovered 
the next line  cumulative deficiency or redundancy  compares the adjusted net liability amount to the net liability amount as originally established and reflects whether the net liability as originally recorded was adequate to cover the estimated cost of claims or redundant

the adverse development for the years ended through was related to both commercial auto and workers compensation 
the commercial auto was most significantly impacted by case strengthening related to a change in claims administration  coupled with the recognition that development factors of prior years were not as indicative of the business written for those respective years due to changes in risk profile and limits 
workers compensation was most affected by changes in legislation that occurred in that took several years to develop  with such development being different than the experience prior to the development for the years ended and was due in part to the strengthening of the unpaid losses and lae of property and casualty businesses assumed by naicc in and workers compensation written prior to naicc has continued to post additional incurred but not reported losses ibnr despite negotiations on several commutations of assumed excess of loss reinsurance contracts that indicated previous estimates of ibnr 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of these liabilities in the past may not necessarily recur in the future especially considering that those ongoing lines that have experienced the greatest adverse development have been placed in run off in and reliance on this cumulative history may not be indicative of future performance 
reinsurance in its normal course of business  naicc reinsures a portion of its exposure with other insurance companies so as to effectively limit its maximum loss arising out of any one occurrence 
contracts of reinsurance do not legally discharge the original insurer from its primary liability

markets  competition and business conditions general business conditions covanta s business can be adversely affected by general economic conditions  war  inflation  adverse competitive conditions  governmental restrictions and controls  change in law  natural disasters  energy shortages  fuel cost and availability  weather  the adverse financial condition of customers and suppliers  various technological changes and other factors over which covanta has no control 
covanta expects in the foreseeable future that competition for new contracts and projects will be intense in all domestic markets in which covanta conducts or intends to conduct its businesses  and its businesses will be subject to a variety of competitive and market influences 
with respect to its waste to energy business  covanta competes in two principal markets  both of which are highly competitive 
the first market in which it competes is the market for waste disposal 
while covanta currently processes for disposal approximately four percent of the municipal solid waste in the united states  the market for waste disposal is almost entirely price driven and is greatly influenced by economic factors within regional waste sheds 
these factors include regional population and overall waste production rates  the number of other waste disposal sites including principally landfills and transfer stations in existence or in the planning or permitting process  the available disposal capacity in terms of tons of waste per day that can be offered by other regional disposal sites  and the availability and cost of transportation options rail  intermodal  trucking to provide access to more distant disposal sites  thereby affecting the size of the waste shed itself 
in this market  covanta competes on disposal price usually on a per ton basis with other disposal service providers seeking to obtain waste supplies to their facilities 
at most of its facilities  covanta is unable to compete in this market because it does not have the contractual right to solicit waste  at these facilities it is the client community which is responsible for obtaining the waste  if necessary by competing on price to obtain the tons of waste it has contractually promised to deliver to covanta s facility 
at all but three of its facilities  covanta is unable to offer material levels of disposal capacity to the market because of existing long term contractual commitments 
at these projects plant capacity is contractually committed and therefore unable to be offered to the market 
at three of its facilities  in haverhill  massachusetts  union county  new jersey  and alexandria  virginia covanta is responsible for obtaining material amounts of waste supply and so is actively competing in these markets to enter into spot medium and long term contracts 
all of these projects are in densely populated areas  with high waste generation rates and numerous large and small participants in the regional market 
once a long term contract expires and is not renewed or extended by a client community  covanta s percentage of contracted disposal capacity will decrease  and it will need to compete in the regional market for waste disposal 
at that point  it will compete on price with landfills  transfer stations  other waste to energy facilities  and other waste disposal technologies that are then offering disposal service in the region 
see 
table of contents discussion below under part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
the second market in which covanta competes related to its waste to energy projects is the market for obtaining new contracts to operate waste to energy facilities  either through greenfield development or through competing to be selected by project owners soliciting bids for new operators 
in this market  there are fewer competitors than in the broader waste disposal market 
this market for new waste to energy facilities is anticipated to be very limited with few opportunities for the foreseeable future 
since before its bankruptcy filing in  covanta has not engaged in material development activity with respect to its independent power business 
covanta may consider developing additional renewable energy projects in the future  and if it were to do so would face competition from a large number of independent energy companies 
with respect to its sales of electricity from its waste to energy projects and independent power projects covanta primarily sells its output pursuant to long term contract 
accordingly  it generally does not sell its output into markets where it must compete on price 
as these contracts expire  covanta will participate in such markets if it is unable to enter into new or renewed long term contracts 
see discussion below under part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
once a contract is awarded or a project is financed and constructed  covanta s business can be impacted by a variety of risk factors which can affect profitability over the life of a project 
some of these risks are at least partially within covanta s control  such as successful operation in compliance with law and the presence or absence of labor difficulties or disturbances 
other risk factors  described above  are largely out of covanta s control and may have an adverse impact on a project over a long term operation 
technology covanta has the exclusive right to market in the united states the proprietary mass burn technology of martin gmbh f r umwelt und energietechnik martin 
all of the waste to energy projects that covanta has constructed use the martin technology  although covanta does own and or operate some projects using other technologies 
the principal feature of the martin technology is the reverse reciprocating stoker grate upon which the waste is burned 
the patent for the basic stoker grate technology used in the martin technology expired in  and there are various other expired and unexpired patents relating to the martin technology 
covanta believes that it is martin s know how and worldwide reputation in the waste to energy field  and covanta s know how in designing  constructing and operating waste to energy facilities  rather than the use of patented technology  that is important to covanta s competitive position in the waste to energy industry in the united states 
covanta does not believe that the expiration of the patent covering the basic stoker grate technology or patents on other portions of the martin technology will have a material adverse effect on covanta s financial condition or competitive position 
covanta believes that mass burn technology is now the predominant technology used for the combustion of solid waste 
covanta believes that the martin technology is a proven and reliable mass burn technology  and that its association with martin has created significant name recognition and value for covanta s domestic waste to energy business 
since  covanta s rights to the martin technology have been provided pursuant to a cooperation agreement with martin which gives covanta exclusive rights to market  and distribute parts and equipment for the martin technology in the united states  canada  mexico  bermuda and certain caribbean countries 
martin is obligated to assist covanta in installing  operating and maintaining facilities incorporating the martin technology 
the cooperation agreement renews automatically each year unless notice of termination is given  in which case the cooperation agreement would terminate years after such notice 
any termination would not affect the rights of covanta to design  construct  operate  maintain or repair waste to energy facilities for which contracts have been entered into or proposals made prior to the date of termination 

table of contents insurance services the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
the insurance industry consists of a large number of companies  many of which operate in more than one state  offering automobile  homeowners and commercial property insurance  as well as insurance coverage in other lines 
many of naicc s competitors have larger volumes of business  greater financial resources and higher financial strength ratings 
naicc s competitors having greater shares of the california market sell automobile insurance either directly to consumers  through independent agents and brokers or through exclusive agency arrangements similar to scj 
the principal means by which insurance service s competes with other automobile insurers is by its focus on meeting the needs of the non standard private passenger automobile market in california where it believes it has competitive pricing  underwriting and service capabilities 
insurance services also competes by using niche marketing efforts of its products through scj 
the operating results of a property and casualty insurer are influenced by a variety of factors including general economic conditions  competition  regulation of insurance rates  weather  frequency and severity of losses 
the california non standard personal auto market in which naicc operates has experienced a recovery of rate adequacy coupled with stable competition 
frequency of claims improved from to and remained stable in  while the average cost of settling claims has steadily improved from to regulation of danielson s businesses danielson s energy and insurance service businesses are highly regulated 
environmental regulatory laws affecting covanta s businesses domestic covanta s business activities in the united states are pervasively regulated pursuant to federal  state and local environmental laws 
federal laws  such as the clean air act and clean water act  and their state counterparts  govern discharges of pollutants to air and water 
other federal  state and local laws comprehensively govern the generation  transportation  storage  treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and also regulate the storage and handling of chemicals and petroleum products such laws and the regulations thereunder  environmental regulatory laws 
other federal  state and local laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla collectively  environmental remediation laws make covanta potentially liable on a joint and several basis for any onsite or offsite environmental contamination which may be associated with covanta s activities and the activities at sites  including but not limited to landfills that covanta s subsidiaries have owned  operated or leased or  at which there has been disposal of residue or other waste generated  handled or processed by such subsidiaries 
some state and local laws also impose liabilities for injury to persons or property caused by site contamination 
some service agreements provide for indemnification of operating subsidiaries from some such liabilities 
in addition  other subsidiaries involved in landfill gas projects have access rights to landfill sites pursuant to certain leases that permit the installation  operation and maintenance of landfill gas collection systems 
a portion of these landfill sites is and has been a federally designated superfund site 
each of these leases provide for indemnification of covanta subsidiary from some liabilities associated with these sites 
the environmental regulatory laws require that many permits be obtained before the commencement of construction and operation of any waste to energy  independent power project or water facility  and further requires that permits be maintained throughout the operating life of the facility 
there can be no assurance that all required permits will be issued or re issued  and the process of obtaining such permits can often cause lengthy delays  including delays caused by third party appeals challenging permit issuance 
failure to meet conditions of these permits or of the environmental regulatory laws can subject an operating subsidiary to regulatory enforcement actions by the appropriate governmental unit  which could include fines  penalties  
table of contents damages or other sanctions  such as orders requiring certain remedial actions or limiting or prohibiting operation 
to date  covanta has not incurred material penalties  been required to incur material capital costs or additional expenses  nor been subjected to material restrictions on its operations as a result of violations of environmental regulatory laws or permit requirements 
although covanta s operations are occasionally subject to proceedings and orders pertaining to emissions into the environment and other environmental violations  which may result in fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  covanta believes that it is in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations 
covanta may be identified  along with other entities  as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to cercla and or analogous state laws 
in certain instances covanta may be exposed to joint and several liabilities for remedial action or damages 
covanta s ultimate liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors  including its volumetric share of waste  the total cost of remediation  and the financial viability of other companies that also sent waste to a given site and  in the case of divested operations  its contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations 
the environmental regulatory laws are subject to revision 
new technology may be required or stricter standards may be established for the control of discharges of air or water pollutants for storage and handling of petroleum products or chemicals or for solid or hazardous waste or ash handling and disposal 
thus  as new technology is developed and proven  it may be required to be incorporated into new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities 
this new technology may often be more expensive than that used previously 
the environmental remediation laws prohibit disposal of regulated hazardous waste at covanta s municipal solid waste facilities 
the service agreements recognize the potential for improper deliveries of hazardous wastes and specify procedures for dealing with hazardous waste that is delivered to a facility 
although certain service agreements require covanta s subsidiary to be responsible for some costs related to hazardous waste deliveries  to date no operating subsidiary has incurred material hazardous waste disposal costs 
domestic drinking water facilities are subject to regulation of water quality by the state and federal agencies under the federal safe drinking water act and by similar state laws 
these laws provide for the establishment of uniform minimum national water quality standards  as well as governmental authority to specify the type of treatment processes to be used for public drinking water 
under the federal clean water act  covanta may be required to obtain and comply with national pollutant discharge elimination system permits for discharges from its treatment stations 
generally  under its current contracts  covanta is not responsible for fines and penalties resulting from the delivery to covanta s treatment facility of water not meeting standards set forth in those contracts 
international covanta aims to provide energy generating and other infrastructure through environmentally protective project designs  regardless of the location of a particular project 
this approach is consistent with the stringent environmental requirements of multilateral financing institutions  such as the world bank  and also with covanta s experience in domestic waste to energy projects  where environmentally protective facility design and performance is required 
compliance with environmental standards comparable to those of the united states may be conditions to the provision of credit by multilateral banking agencies as well as other lenders or credit providers 
the laws of other countries also may require regulation of emissions into the environment  and provide governmental entities with the authority to impose sanctions for violations  although these requirements are generally not as rigorous as those applicable in the united states 
as with domestic project development  there can be no assurance that all required permits will be issued  and the process can often cause lengthy delays 

table of contents energy and water regulations affecting covanta s businesses covanta s businesses are subject to the provisions of federal  state and local energy laws applicable to the development  ownership and operation of their domestic facilities and to similar laws applicable to their foreign operations 
federal laws and regulations applicable to many of covanta s domestic energy businesses impose limitations on the types of fuel used  prescribe the degree to which these businesses are subject to federal and state utility type regulation and restrict the extent to which these businesses may be owned by one or more electric utilities 
state regulatory regimes govern rate approval and the other terms and conditions pursuant to which utilities purchase electricity from independent power producers  except to the extent such regulation is governed by federal law 
pursuant to the federal public utility regulatory policies act purpa  the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc has promulgated regulations that exempt qualifying facilities qfs facilities meeting certain size  fuel and ownership requirements from compliance with certain provisions of the federal power act the fpa  the public utility holding company act of puhca  and certain state laws regulating the rates charged by  or the financial and organizational activities of  electric utilities 
purpa was enacted in to encourage the development of cogeneration facilities and other facilities making use of non fossil fuel power sources  including waste to energy facilities 
the exemptions afforded by purpa to qfs from regulation under the fpa and puhca and most aspects of state electric utility regulation are of great importance to covanta and its competitors in the waste to energy and independent power industries 
except with respect to waste to energy facilities with a net power production capacity in excess of mw where rates are set by the ferc  state public utility commissions must approve the rates  and in some instances other contract terms  by which public utilities purchase electric power from qfs 
purpa requires that electric utilities purchase electric energy produced by qfs at negotiated rates or at a price equal to the incremental or avoided cost that would have been incurred by the utility if it were to generate the power itself or purchase it from another source 
purpa does not expressly require public utilities to enter into long term contracts to purchase the output supplied by qfs 
many state public utility commissions have approved longer term energy contracts as part of their implementation of purpa 
under puhca  any entity owning or controlling or more of the voting securities of a public utility company or company which is a holding company of a public utility company is subject to registration with the sec and regulation by the sec unless exempt from registration 
under purpa  most projects that satisfy the definition of a qualifying facility are exempt from regulation under puhca 
under the energy policy act of  projects that are not qfs under purpa but satisfy the definition of an exempt wholesale generator are not deemed to be public utility companies under puhca 
finally  projects that satisfy the definition of foreign utility companies are exempt from regulation under puhca 
covanta believes that all of its operating projects involved in the generation  transmission and or distribution of electricity  both domestically and internationally  qualify for an exemption from puhca and that it is not and will not be required to register with the sec under puhca 
congress continues from time to time to consider energy legislation to repeal both purpa and puhca 
repeal of puhca would allow both independent power producers and vertically integrated utilities to acquire electric assets throughout the united states that are geographically widespread  eliminating the current requirement that the utility s electric assets be capable of physical integration 
also  registered holding companies would be free to acquire non utility businesses  which they may not do now  with certain limited exceptions 
with the repeal of purpa or puhca  competition for independent power generators from utilities would likely increase 
this is likely to have little or no impact on covanta s existing projects  but may mean additional competition from highly capitalized companies seeking to develop projects in the us covanta presently has ownership and operating interests in electric generating projects outside the united states 
most countries have expansive systems for the regulation of the power business 
these generally include provisions relating to ownership  licensing  rate setting and financing of generating and transmission facilities 

table of contents insurance services business insurance companies are subject to insurance laws and regulations established by the states in which they transact business 
the agencies established pursuant to these state laws have broad administrative and supervisory powers relating to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  regulation of trade practices  establishment of guaranty associations  licensing of agents  approval of policy forms  premium rate filing requirements  reserve requirements  the form and content of required regulatory financial statements  capital and surplus requirements and the maximum concentrations of certain classes of investments 
most states also have enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company systems  including acquisitions  extraordinary dividends  the terms of affiliate transactions and other related matters 
danielson and its insurance subsidiaries have registered as holding company systems pursuant to such legislation in california and montana  and routinely report to other jurisdictions 
the national association of insurance commissioners the association has formed committees and appointed advisory groups to study and formulate regulatory proposals on such diverse issues as the use of surplus debentures  accounting for reinsurance transactions and the adoption of risk based capital requirements 
it is not possible to predict the impact of future state and federal regulation on the operations of danielson or its insurance services business 
effective january   the association s codified statutory accounting principles sap had been adopted by all us insurance companies 
the purpose of such codification is to provide a comprehensive basis of accounting and reporting to insurance departments 
although codification is expected to be the foundation of a state s statutory accounting practice  it may be subject to modification by practices prescribed or permitted by a state s insurance commissioner 
therefore  statutory financial statements will continue to be prepared on the basis of accounting practice prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile 
dividends naicc is an insurance company domiciled in the state of california and is regulated by the california department of insurance for the benefit of policyholders 
the california insurance code does not permit the payment of an extraordinary shareholder dividend without prior approval from the california insurance commissioner 
dividends are considered extraordinary if they exceed the greater of net income or of statutory surplus as of the preceding december st 
at this time and into the foreseeable future naicc does not have sufficient accumulated earned surplus to pay further ordinary dividends 
capital adequacy and risk based capital a model for determining the risk based capital rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies was adopted in december the model generally assesses danielson s assets at risk and underwriting operations and determines policyholders surplus levels necessary to support such activity 
naicc has calculated its rbc requirement under the most recent rbc model and  as of december   it had capital in excess of any regulatory action level 
the rbc model sets forth four levels of increasing regulatory intervention company action level of an insurer s authorized control level at which the insurer must submit to the regulator a plan for increasing such insurer s capital  regulatory action level of an insurer s authorized control level  at which the insurer must submit a plan for increasing its capital to the regulator and the regulator may issue corrective orders  authorized control level  a multi step calculation based upon information derived from an insurer s most recent filed statutory annual statement  at which the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer  and mandatory control level of an insurer s authorized control level  at which the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
at december   the rbc of naicc improved to compared to in as discussed further in this report at part  item  business introduction  acl filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result  it was determined that naicc s investment in acl was fully impaired for statutory accounting purposes 
at december   naicc recognized a statutory charge to its surplus of million 
this charge  when combined with naicc s 
table of contents underwriting results and investment losses  reduced its statutory surplus level below the company action level of naicc s rbc calculation 
in response  danielson repaid a million note due may to naicc  and further contributed million to naicc to increase its statutory capital during february with permission from the california department of insurance  these amounts were recorded as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes at december  after consideration for the million noted above  naicc s reported capital and surplus as of december  was above the company action level of naicc s rbc calculation 
in december  danielson contributed million to naicc to increase its statutory capital 
no contributions were made by danielson to its insurance operations in recent developments acquisition of american ref fuel holdings corp 
on january   danielson entered into a stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with american ref fuel holdings corp 
ref fuel  an owner and operator of waste to energy facilities in the northeast united states  and ref fuel s stockholders to purchase of the issued and outstanding shares of american ref fuel capital stock 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  danielson will pay million in cash for the stock of ref fuel and will assume the consolidated net debt of ref fuel  which as of december   was approximately billion 
after the transaction is completed  ref fuel will be a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta 
the acquisition is expected to close when all of the closing conditions to the purchase agreement have been satisfied or waived 
these closing conditions include the receipt of approvals  clearances and the satisfaction of all waiting periods as required under the hart scott rodino antitrust act of and as required by certain governmental authorities such as the federal energy regulatory commission and other applicable regulatory authorities 
other closing conditions of the transaction include the following danielson s completion of debt financing and an equity ref fuel rights offering  as further described below  danielson arranging letters of credit or other financial accommodations in the aggregate amount of million to replace two currently outstanding letters of credit that have been entered into by two respective subsidiaries of ref fuel and issued in favor of a third subsidiary of ref fuel  and other customary closing conditions 
while it is anticipated that all of the applicable conditions will be satisfied  there can be no assurance as to whether or when all of those conditions will be satisfied or  where permissible  waived 
either danielson or the selling stockholders of ref fuel may terminate the purchase agreement if the acquisition does not occur on or before june  if a required governmental or regulatory approval has not been received by such date  however  then either party may extend the closing to a date that is no later than the later of august  or the date days after which ref fuel has provided to danielson certain financial statements described in the purchase agreement 
if the purchase agreement is terminated because of danielson s failure to complete the rights offering and financing as described below  and all other closing conditions are capable of being satisfied  danielson must pay to the selling stockholders of ref fuel a termination fee of million  of which no less than million shall be paid in cash and of which up to million may be paid in shares of danielson s common stock  at its election  calculated based on per share 
as of the date of the purchase agreement  danielson entered into a registration rights agreement granting registration rights to the selling stockholders of ref fuel with respect to such termination fee stock and danielson has deposited million in cash in an escrow account pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement 
financing the ref fuel acquisition danielson intends to finance this transaction through a combination of debt and equity financing 
the equity component of the financing is expected to consist of an approximately million offering of warrants or other rights to purchase danielson s common stock to all of danielson s existing stockholders at per share the ref fuel rights offering 
in the ref fuel rights offering danielson s existing stockholders 
table of contents will be issued rights to danielson s stock on a pro rata basis  with each holder entitled to purchase approximately shares of danielson s common stock at an exercise price of per full share for each share of danielson s common stock then held 
danielson will file a registration statement with the sec with respect to such rights offering and the statements contained herein shall not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy shares of danielson s common stock 
any such offer or solicitation will be made in compliance with all applicable securities laws 
three of danielson s largest stockholders  sz investments together with its affiliate  egi fund investors  llc to which it transferred a portion of it shares  tavf and laminar  representing ownership of approximately of danielson s outstanding common stock  have committed to participate in the ref fuel rights offering and acquire their pro rata portion of the shares 
as consideration for their commitments  danielson will pay each of these four stockholders an amount equal to to of their respective equity commitments  depending on the timing of the transaction 
danielson agreed to amend an existing registration rights agreement to provide these stockholders with the right to demand that danielson undertake an underwritten offering within twelve months of the closing of the acquisition of ref fuel in order to provide such stockholders with liquidity 
danielson also expects to complete its previously announced rights offering for up to million shares of its common stock to certain holders of debentures issued by covanta at a purchase price of per share the offering 
danielson has executed a letter agreement with laminar pursuant to which danielson agreed to restructure the offering if that offering has not closed prior to the record date for the ref fuel rights offering so that the holders that participate in the offering are offered additional shares of danielson common stock at the same purchase price as in the ref fuel rights offering and in an amount equal to the number of shares of common stock that such holders would have been entitled to purchase in the ref fuel rights offering if the offering was consummated on or prior to the record date for the ref fuel rights offering 
assuming exercise of all rights in the ref fuel rights offering and the purchase of three million shares in the offering  the company estimates that it will have approximately million shares outstanding following the consummation of both rights offerings 
danielson has received a commitment from goldman sachs credit partners  lp and credit suisse first boston for a debt financing package for covanta necessary to finance the acquisition  as well as to refinance the existing recourse debt of covanta and provide additional liquidity 
it is currently expected that this financing shall consist of two tranches  each of which is secured by pledges of the stock of covanta s subsidiaries that has not otherwise been pledged  guarantees from certain of covanta s subsidiaries and all other available assets of covanta s subsidiaries 
the first tranche  a first priority senior secured bank facility  shall be made up of a million term loan facility  a million revolving credit facility and a million letter of credit facility 
the second tranche  a second priority senior secured term loan facility  shall consist of a million term loan facility 
danielson estimates that there will be approximately million in aggregate transaction expenses including customary underwriting and commitment fees relating to the financing 
immediately upon closing of the acquisition  ref fuel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta  and covanta will control the management and operations of the ref fuel facilities 
the current project and other debt of ref fuel subsidiaries will be unaffected by the acquisition  except that the revolving credit and letter of credit facility of american ref fuel company llc the direct parent of each ref fuel project company will be cancelled and replaced with new facilities at the covanta level 
for additional information concerning the combined capital structure of covanta and ref fuel following the acquisition  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that danielson will be able to complete the ref fuel rights offering  obtain the credit facilities or complete the acquisition of ref fuel

table of contents risk factors the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on danielson s business  financial condition and results of operations 
danielson specific risks the market for our common stock has been historically illiquid which may affect your ability to sell your shares 
the volume of trading in our stock has historically been low 
in the last six months  the daily trading volume for our stock has been approximately  shares 
having a market for shares without substantial liquidity can adversely affect the price of the stock at a time an investor might want to sell his  her or its shares 
reduced liquidity and price volatility could result in a loss to investors 
although our common stock is listed on the amex  there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of an investment in our common stock or as to the price an investor may realize upon the sale of our common stock 
these prices are determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors  including the liquidity of the market for our common stock  the market price of our common stock  investor perception and general economic and market conditions 
concentrated stock ownership and charter provision may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals 
assuming the issuance of million shares of our common stock in the offering sz investments together with its affiliate egi fund investors  tavf and laminar separately own or will have the right to acquire approximately  and  respectively  or when aggregated  of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders have each separately committed to participate in the ref fuel rights offering to finance the company s acquisition of ref fuel and acquire their pro rata portion of shares in the ref fuel rights offering 
although there are no agreements among sz investments  tavf and laminar regarding their voting or disposition of shares of our common stock  the level of their combined ownership of shares of common stock could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
in addition  the change in ownership limitations contained in article fifth of our charter could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited takeover proposal 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
no prediction can be made as to the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our common stock for future sales  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  in connection with the covanta acquisition financing  we have filed a registration statement on form s to register the resale of  shares of our common stock held by laminar  tavf and sz investments and in connection with our proposed acquisition of ref fuel we intend to register additional shares to be offered in a pro rata rights offering and have agreed to register the resale of certain shares held or acquired by laminar  tavf and sz investments in an underwritten public offering 
we have also agreed to register any shares issuable to current shareholders of ref fuel in the event the purchase agreement we entered into with ref fuel stockholders is terminated due to our failure to complete the equity and debt financing for such acquisition 
the potential effect of these shares being sold may be to depress the price at which our common stock trades 
our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud 
our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act is accumulated and 
table of contents communicated to management recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our companies have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  section and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec to implement section  we are required to furnish a report to include in our form k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
we have in the past  and in the future may discover  areas of our internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement 
for example  during the course of its audit of our financial statements  our independent auditors  ernst young llp identified errors  principally related to complex manual fresh start accounting calculations  predominantly effecting covanta s investments in its international businesses 
these errors  the net effect of which was immaterial less than million  pretax  have been corrected in our consolidated financial statements 
management determined that errors in complex fresh start and other technical accounting areas originally went undetected due to insufficient technical in house expertise necessary to provide sufficiently rigorous review 
as a result  management has concluded that danielson s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  the company has identified and undertaken steps necessary in order to address this material weakness  but the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future will depend on our effectiveness in fulfilling these steps to address this material weakness 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect in our stock price 
we cannot be certain that the net operating loss tax carryforwards will continue to be available to offset our tax liability 
as of december   we had approximately million of nols 
in order to utilize the nols  we must generate taxable income which can offset such carryforwards 
the nols are also utilized by income from certain grantor trusts that were established as part of the mission insurance reorganization 
the nols will expire if not used 
the availability of nols to offset taxable income would be substantially reduced if we were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
we will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a increase in stock ownership during a three year testing period by stockholders 

table of contents in order to help us preserve the nols  our certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions designed to reduce the risk of an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code 
the transfer restrictions were implemented in  and we expect that the restrictions will remain in force as long as the nols are available 
we cannot assure you  however  that these restrictions will prevent an ownership change 
the nols will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and the internal revenue service has not audited any of our tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported 
we cannot assure you that we would prevail if the irs were to challenge the availability of the nols 
if the irs was successful in challenging our nols  all or some portion of the nols would not be available to offset our future consolidated income and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to covanta under a tax sharing agreement described below  or to pay taxes that may be due from our consolidated tax group 
reductions in our nols could occur in connection with the emergence from bankruptcy of the mission insurance entities 
while we will attempt to manage the tax consequences of that transaction  taxable income could result which could materially reduce our nols 
for a more detailed discussion of the mission insurance entities  please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  if our existing insurance services business were to require capital infusions from us in order to meet certain regulatory capital requirements  and were we to fail to provide such capital  some or all of our subsidiaries comprising our insurance services business could enter insurance insolvency proceedings 
in such event  such subsidiaries would no longer be included in our consolidated tax return  and a portion  which could constitute a significant portion  of our remaining nols would no longer be available to us 
covanta specific risks covanta emerged from bankruptcy with a large amount of domestic debt  and we cannot assure you that its cash flow from domestic operations will be sufficient to pay this debt 
as of december   covanta s outstanding domestic corporate debt was million 
covanta s ability to service its domestic debt will depend upon its ability to continue to operate and maintain its facilities consistent with historical performance levels  its ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants  its ability to avoid increases in overhead and operating expenses in view of the largely fixed nature of its revenues  its ability to maintain or enhance revenue from renewals or replacement of existing contracts  which begin to expire in october and from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities  market conditions affecting waste disposal and energy pricing  as well as competition from other companies for contract renewals  expansions  and additional contracts  particularly after its existing contracts expire 
the continued availability to covanta of the benefit of danielson s net operating losses under the tax sharing agreement  and its ability to refinance its domestic corporate debt  whether in conjunction with the ref fuel acquisition or otherwise 
covanta is currently in compliance with all of its domestic debt covenants 
for a more detailed discussion of covanta s domestic debt covenants please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the amount of unsecured claims for which covanta is liable has not been determined and could exceed our estimates 
in connection with covanta s emergence from bankruptcy  covanta authorized the issuance of million of unsecured notes under an indenture 
although covanta estimates that it will issue such notes in an amount less than million  the ultimate amount of unsecured notes will not be determined until remaining claims are resolved through settlement or litigation in bankruptcy court 
we cannot assure you that the final amount of such notes issued will be less than covanta s estimate  or that the ultimate resolution of such claims will result in liabilities of less than million 
covanta may not be able to refinance its domestic debt agreements prior to maturity 
covanta issued high yield notes  which mature in prior to maturity  covanta is obligated to pay only interest  and no principal  with respect to these notes 
covanta s cash flow may be insufficient to pay the principal at maturity  which will be million at such time 
consequently  covanta may be obligated to refinance these notes prior to maturity 
covanta may refinance the notes during the first two years after issuance without paying a premium  and thereafter may refinance these notes but must pay a premium to do so 
several of covanta s contracts require it to provide certain letters of credit to contract counterparties 
the aggregate stated amount of these letters declines materially each year  particularly prior to covanta s financing arrangements under which these letters of credit are issued expire in  and so it must refinance these arrangements in order to allow covanta to continue to provide the letters of credit beyond the current expiration date 
although the company has received a commitment from goldman sachs credit partners  lp and credit suisse first boston for a debt financing package for covanta necessary to finance the proposed acquisition of ref fuel  as well as to refinance the existing recourse debt of covanta  such refinancing is contingent upon consummation of the ref fuel acquisition 
we cannot assure you that covanta will be able to obtain refinancing on acceptable terms  or at all  either in conjunction with the ref fuel acquisition or otherwise 
covanta s ability to grow its business is limited 
covanta s ability to grow its domestic business by investing in new projects will be limited by debt covenants in its principal financing agreements  unless such financing agreements are refinanced  and from potentially fewer market opportunities for new waste to energy facilities 
covanta s business is based upon building and operating municipal solid waste processing and energy generating projects  which are capital intensive businesses that require financing through direct investment and the incurrence of debt 
when we acquired covanta and it emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in march  covanta entered into financing arrangements with restrictive covenants typical of financings for companies emerging from bankruptcy 
these covenants essentially prohibit investments in new projects or acquisitions of new businesses and place restrictions on covanta s ability to expand existing projects 
the covenants prohibit borrowings to finance new construction  except in limited circumstances related to specifically identified expansions of existing facilities 
the covenants also limit spending for new business development and require that excess cash flow be trapped to collateralize outstanding letters of credit 
although the company will be negotiating debt covenants for the refinancing of covanta s debt in connection with the ref fuel acquisition  such financing is contingent upon consummation of the ref fuel acquisition 
we cannot assure you that  when it seeks to refinance its domestic debt agreements  covanta will be able to negotiate covenants that will provide it with more flexibility to grow its business 
covanta s liquidity is limited by the amount of domestic debt issued when it emerged from bankruptcy 
covanta believes that its cash flow from domestic operations will be sufficient to pay for its domestic cash needs  including debt service on its domestic corporate debt  and that its revolving credit facility will provide a 
table of contents secondary source of liquidity 
for the period march through december   covanta s cash flow from operating activities for domestic operations was million 
we cannot assure you  however  that covanta s cash flow from domestic operations will not be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions or circumstances specific to one or more projects or that if such conditions or circumstances do occur  its revolving credit facility will provide covanta with access to sufficient cash for such purposes 
operation of covanta s facilities and the construction of new or expanded facilities involve significant risks 
the operation of covanta s facilities and the construction of new or expanded facilities involve many risks  including the inaccuracy of covanta s assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of anticipated revenues  supply interruptions  permitting and other regulatory issues  license revocation and changes in legal requirements  labor disputes and work stoppages  unforeseen engineering and environmental problems  unanticipated cost overruns  weather interferences  catastrophic events including fires  explosions  earthquakes  droughts and acts of terrorism  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
we cannot predict the impact of these risks on covanta s business or operations 
expansion of covanta s existing plants or construction of new plants may require covanta to use additional new technology which may increase construction costs 
expansions of existing plants and construction of new plants may require that covanta incorporate recently developed and technologically complex equipment  especially in the case of newer environmental emission control technology 
inclusion of such new technology may materially increase the cost of construction 
covanta s insurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 
although covanta maintains insurance  obtains warranties from vendors  obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels and attempts  where feasible  to pass risks covanta cannot control to the service recipient or output purchaser  the proceeds of such insurance  warranties  performance guarantees or risk sharing arrangements may not be adequate to cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 
performance reductions could materially and adversely affect covanta 
any of the risks described in this annual report on form k or unforeseen problems could cause covanta s projects to operate below expected levels  which in turn could result in lost revenues  increased expenses  higher maintenance costs and penalties for defaults under covanta s service agreements and operating contracts 
as a result  a project may operate at less than expected levels of profit or at a loss 
most of covanta s service agreements for waste to energy facilities provide for limitations on damages and cross indemnities among the parties for damages that such parties may incur in connection with their performance under the contract 
such contractual provisions excuse covanta from performance obligations to the extent affected by uncontrollable circumstances and provide for service fee adjustments if uncontrollable 
table of contents circumstances increase its costs 
we cannot assure you that these provisions will prevent covanta from incurring losses upon the occurrence of uncontrollable circumstances or that if covanta were to incur such losses it would continue to be able to service its debt 
covanta and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations undertaken mainly pursuant to agreements to construct and operate certain energy and water facilities 
with respect to its domestic businesses  covanta has issued guarantees to its municipal clients and other parties that covanta s subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
the obligations guaranteed will depend upon the contract involved 
many of covanta s subsidiaries have contracts to operate and maintain waste to energy facilities 
in these contracts the subsidiary typically commits to operate and maintain the facility in compliance with legal requirements  to accept minimum amounts of solid waste  to generate a minimum amount of electricity per ton of waste  and to pay damages to contract counterparties under specified circumstances  including those where the operating subsidiary s contract has been terminated for default 
in its operating history  covanta has not incurred liability to pay material amounts under these guarantees  and has incurred no liability to repay project debt 
such contractual damages or other obligations could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
additionally  damages payable under such guarantees on company owned waste to energy facilities could expose covanta to recourse liability on project debt 
covanta may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages or other obligations 
although it has not incurred material liability under energy  water and waste to energy guarantees previously and has incurred no liability to repay project debt  we cannot assure you that covanta will be able to continue to avoid incurring material payment obligations under such guarantees or that if it did incur such obligations that it would have the cash resources to pay them 
with respect to the international projects  cpih  covanta and certain of covanta s domestic subsidiaries have issued guarantees of cpih s operating obligations 
the potential damages that may be owed under these guarantees may be material 
covanta is generally entitled to be reimbursed by cpih for any payments it may make under guarantees related to international projects 
covanta generates its revenue primarily under long term contracts  and must avoid defaults under its contracts in order to service its debt and avoid material liability to contract counterparties 
covanta must satisfy its performance and other obligations under its contracts to operate waste to energy facilities 
these contracts typically require covanta to meet certain performance criteria relating to amounts of waste processed  energy generation rates per ton of waste processed  residue quantity  and environmental standards 
covanta s failure to satisfy these criteria may subject it to termination of its operating contracts 
if such a termination were to occur  covanta would lose the cash flow related to the project  and incur material termination damage liability 
in circumstances where the contract of one or more subsidiaries has been terminated due to covanta s default  covanta may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages 
none of covanta s operating contracts for its waste to energy facilities previously have been terminated for covanta s default 
we cannot assure you  however  that covanta will be able to continue to be able to perform its obligations under such contracts in order to avoid such contract terminations  or damages related to any such contract termination  or that if it could not avoid such terminations that it would have the cash resources to pay amounts that may then become due 
covanta may face increased risk of market influences on its domestic revenues after its contracts expire 
covanta s contracts to operate waste to energy projects begin to expire in  and its contracts to sell energy output generally expire when the project s operating contract expires 
one of covanta s contracts will expire in during the nine month period january to december   this contract contributed million in revenues 
expiration of these contracts will subject covanta to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its operating contracts at municipally owned projects approach expiration  covanta will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such 
table of contents projects 
covanta will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
the expiration of covanta s existing energy sales contracts  if not renewed  will require covanta to sell project energy output either into the electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
at some of covanta s facilities  market conditions may allow covanta to effect extensions of existing operating contracts along with facility expansions which would increase the waste processing capacity of these projects 
such extensions and expansions are currently being considered at a limited number of covanta s facilities in conjunction with its municipal clients 
if covanta were unable to reach agreement with its municipal clients on the terms under which it would implement such extensions and expansions  or if the implementation of these extensions and expansions is materially delayed  this may adversely affect covanta s cash flow and profitability 
covanta s cash flow and profitability may be adversely affected if it is unable to obtain contracts acceptable to it for such renewals  replacements or additional contracts  or extension and expansion contracts 
we cannot assure you that covanta will be able to enter into such contracts or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to covanta 
concentration of suppliers and customers may expose covanta to heightened financial exposure 
covanta often relies on single suppliers and single customers at covanta s facilities  exposing such facilities to financial risks if any supplier or customer should fail to perform its obligations 
covanta often relies on a single supplier to provide waste  fuel  water and other services required to operate a facility and on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility s output or capacity 
in most cases  covanta has long term agreements with such suppliers and customers in order to mitigate the risk of supply interruption 
the financial performance of these facilities depends on such customers and suppliers continuing to perform their obligations under their long term agreements 
a facility s financial results could be materially and adversely affected if any one customer or supplier fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and covanta is unable to find other customers or suppliers to produce the same level of profitability 
we cannot assure you that such performance failures by third parties will not occur  or that if they do occur  such failures will not adversely affect covanta s cash flow or profitability 
in addition  for its waste to energy facilities  covanta relies on its municipal clients as a source not only of waste for fuel but also of revenue from fees for disposal services covanta provides 
because covanta s contracts with its municipal clients are generally long term none expires prior to  covanta may be adversely affected if the credit quality of one or more of its municipal clients were to decline materially 
we cannot assure you that such credit quality will not decline  or that if one or more of covanta s municipal clients credit quality does decline  that it would not adversely affect covanta s domestic cash flow or profitability 
covanta s international businesses emerged from bankruptcy with a large amount of debt  and we cannot assure you that its cash flow from international operations will be sufficient to pay this debt 
covanta s subsidiary holding the equity interests in its international businesses  cpih  is also highly leveraged  and its debt will be serviced solely from the cash generated from the international operations 
cash distributions from international projects are typically less dependable as to timing and amount than distributions from domestic projects  and we cannot assure you that cpih will have sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to pay the principal or interest due on its debt 
as of december   covanta s outstanding international debt was million  consisting of million of cpih recourse debt and million of project debt 

table of contents cpih s ability to service its debt will depend upon its ability to continue to operate and maintain its facilities consistent with historical performance levels  stable foreign political environments that do not resort to expropriation  contract renegotiations or currency or exchange changes  the financial ability of the electric and steam purchasers to pay the full contractual tariffs on a timely basis  the ability of its international project subsidiaries to maintain compliance with their respective project debt covenants in order to make equity distributions to cpih  and its ability to sell existing projects in an amount sufficient to repay cpih indebtedness at or prior to its maturity in march  or to refinance its indebtedness at or prior to such maturity 
cpih s debt is due in march  and it will need to refinance its debt or obtain cash from other sources to repay this debt at maturity 
covanta believes that cash from cpih s operations  together with liquidity available under cpih s revolving credit facility  will provide cpih with sufficient liquidity to meet its needs for cash  including cash to pay debt service on cpih s debt prior to maturity in march covanta believes that cpih will not have sufficient cash from its operations and its revolving credit facility to pay off its debt at maturity  and so if it is unable to generate sufficient additional cash from asset sales or other sources  cpih will need to refinance its debt at or prior to maturity 
while cpih s debt is non recourse to covanta  it is secured by a pledge of covanta s stock in cpih and cpih s equity interests in certain of its subsidiaries 
while we have financing commitments to refinance covanta s debt  and to repay cpih s debt entirely  in connection with the acquisition of ref fuel  such financing is contingent upon consummation of the ref fuel acquisition 
we cannot assure you that such additional cash will be available to cpih  or that it will be able to refinance its debt on acceptable terms  or at all 
cpih s assets and cash flow will not be available to covanta 
although cpih s results of operations are consolidated with danielson s and covanta s for financial reporting purposes  as long as the existing cpih term loan and revolver remain outstanding  cpih is restricted under its existing credit agreements from distributing cash to covanta 
under these agreements  cpih s cash may only be used for cpih s purposes and to service cpih s debt 
accordingly  although reported on danielson s and covanta s consolidated financial statements  covanta does not have access to cpih s revenues or cash flows and will have access only to covanta s domestically generated cash flows 
a sale or transfer of cpih or its assets may not be sufficient to repay cpih indebtedness 
although cpih s results of operations are consolidated with danielson s and covanta s for financial reporting purposes  due to cpih s indebtedness and the terms of covanta s credit agreements  cpih s cash flow is available only to repay cpih s debt 
similarly  in the event that cpih determines that it is desirable to sell or transfer all or any portion of its assets or business  the proceeds would first be applied to reduce cpih s debt 
we cannot assure you that the proceeds of any such sale would be sufficient to repay all of cpih s debt  consisting of principal and accrued interest or  if sufficient to repay cpih s debt  that such proceeds would offset the loss of cpih s revenues and earnings as reported by danielson and covanta in their respective consolidated financial statements 
although danielson has received a commitment from goldman sachs credit partners  lp and credit suisse first boston for a debt financing package for covanta necessary to finance the acquisition of ref fuel  as well as to refinance the existing recourse debt of covanta and repay all of cpih s recourse debt  such financing is contingent upon consummation of the ref fuel acquisition 
we cannot assure you that this financing will close 
in the absence of a successful closing of the ref fuel acquisition and its related financing  we cannot assure you that cpih will be able to obtain refinancing on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect covanta s business 
cpih s operations are entirely outside the united states and expose it to legal  tax  currency  inflation  convertibility and repatriation risks  as well as potential constraints on the development and operation of potential business  any of which can limit the benefits to cpih of a foreign project 
cpih s projected cash distributions from existing facilities over the next five years comes from facilities located in countries having sovereign ratings below investment grade  including bangladesh  the philippines and india 
in addition  covanta continues to provide operating guarantees and letters of credit for certain of cpih s projects  which if drawn upon would require cpih to reimburse covanta for any related payments it may be required to make 
the financing  development and operation of projects outside the united states can entail significant political and financial risks  which vary by country  including changes in law or regulations  changes in electricity tariffs  changes in foreign tax laws and regulations  changes in united states  federal  state and local laws  including tax laws  related to foreign operations  compliance with united states  federal  state and local foreign corrupt practices laws  changes in government policies or personnel  changes in general economic conditions affecting each country  including conditions in financial markets  changes in labor relations in operations outside the united states  political  economic or military instability and civil unrest  and expropriation and confiscation of assets and facilities 
the legal and financial environment in foreign countries in which cpih currently owns assets or projects also could make it more difficult for it to enforce its rights under agreements relating to such projects 
the occurrence of any of these risks could substantially delay the receipt of cash distributions from international projects or reduce the value of the project concerned 
in addition  the existence of the operating guarantees and letters of credit provided by covanta for cpih projects could expose it to any or all of the risks identified above with respect to the cpih projects  particularly if cpih s cash flow or other sources of liquidity are insufficient to reimburse covanta for amounts due under such instruments 
as a result  these risks may have a material adverse effect on covanta s business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations and on cpih s ability to service its debt 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may affect covanta s costs of operations 
cpih sought to participate in projects in jurisdictions where limitations on the convertibility and expatriation of currency have been lifted by the host country and where such local currency is freely exchangeable on the international markets 
in most cases  components of project costs incurred or funded in the currency of the united states are recovered with limited exposure to currency fluctuations through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation 
as a result  there is a risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 

table of contents exposure to fuel supply prices may affect cpih s costs and results of operations 
changes in the market prices and availability of fuel supplies to generate electricity may increase cpih s cost of producing power  which could adversely impact our profitability and financial performance 
the market prices and availability of fuel supplies of some of cpih s facilities fluctuate 
although cpih believes that it has adequate and reliable fuel supplies and that its suppliers have adequate production and transportation systems to comply with their contractual requirements to supply cpih s facilities  any price increase  delivery disruption or reduction in the availability of such supplies could affect cpih s ability to operate cpih s facilities and impair its cash flow and profitability 
cpih may be subject to further exposure if any of its future operations are concentrated in facilities using fuel types subject to fluctuating market prices and availability 
covanta may not be successful in its efforts to mitigate its exposure to supply and price swings 
covanta s inability to obtain resources for operations may adversely affect its ability to effectively compete 
covanta s waste to energy facilities depend on solid waste both for fuel and as a source of revenue 
for most of covanta s facilities  the prices it charges for disposal of solid waste are fixed under long term contracts and the supply is guaranteed by sponsoring municipalities 
however  for some of covanta s waste to energy facilities  the availability of solid waste to covanta  as well as the tipping fee that covanta must charge to attract solid waste to its facilities  depends upon competition from a number of sources such as other waste to energy facilities  landfills and transfer stations competing for waste in the market area 
in addition  covanta may need to obtain waste on a short term competitive basis as its long term contracts expire at its owned facilities 
there has been and may be further consolidation in the solid waste industry which would reduce the number of solid waste collectors or haulers that are competing for disposal facilities or enable such collectors or haulers to use wholesale purchasing to negotiate favorable below market disposal rates 
the consolidation in the solid waste industry has resulted in companies with vertically integrated collection activities and disposal facilities 
such consolidation may result in economies of scale for those companies as well as the use of disposal capacity at facilities owned by such companies or by affiliated companies 
such activities can affect both the availability of waste to covanta for disposal at some of covanta s waste to energy facilities and market pricing 
compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect covanta s results of operations 
costs of compliance with existing and future environmental regulations by federal  state and local authorities could adversely affect covanta s cash flow and profitability 
covanta s business is subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities  primarily relating to air  waste including residual ash from combustion and water 
covanta is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits in operating covanta s facilities 
covanta may incur significant additional costs to comply with these requirements 
environmental regulations may also limit covanta s ability to operate covanta s facilities at maximum capacity  or at all 
if covanta fails to comply with these requirements  covanta could be subject to civil or criminal liability  damages and fines 
existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to covanta or its facilities  and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur 
this may materially increase the amount covanta must invest to bring its facilities into compliance 
in addition  lawsuits by the environmental protection agency  commonly referred to as the epa  and various states highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities 
stricter environmental regulation of air emissions  solid waste handling or combustion  residual ash handling and disposal  and waste water discharge could materially affect covanta s cash flow and profitability 
covanta may not be able to obtain or maintain  from time to time  all required environmental regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if covanta fails to obtain and comply with them  the operation of covanta s facilities could be jeopardized or become subject to additional costs 

table of contents federal energy regulation could adversely affect covanta s revenues and costs of operations 
covanta s business is subject to extensive energy regulations by federal and state authorities 
the economics  including the costs  of operating covanta s generating facilities may be adversely affected by any changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation or any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements 
the public utility holding company act of and the federal power act  regulate public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries and place constraints on the conduct of their business 
the fpa regulates wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities 
under the public utility regulatory policies act of  covanta s domestic facilities are qualifying facilities facilities meeting statutory size  fuel and ownership requirements  which are exempt from regulations under puhca  most provisions of the fpa and state rate regulation 
covanta s foreign projects are exempt from regulation under puhca 
if covanta becomes subject to either the fpa or puhca  the economics and operations of covanta s energy projects could be adversely affected  including rate regulation by the federal energy regulation commission  with respect to its output of electricity 
if an alternative exemption from puhca was not available  covanta could be subject to regulation by the sec as a public utility holding company 
in addition  depending on the terms of the project s power purchase agreement  a loss of covanta s exemptions could allow the power purchaser to cease taking and paying for electricity or to seek refunds of past amounts paid 
such results could cause the loss of some or all contract revenues or otherwise impair the value of a project and could trigger defaults under provisions of the applicable project contracts and financing agreements 
defaults under such financing agreements could render the underlying debt immediately due and payable 
under such circumstances  covanta cannot assure you that revenues received  the costs incurred  or both  in connection with the project could be recovered through sales to other purchasers 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect covanta s operations 
covanta is continually in the process of obtaining or renewing federal  state and local approvals required to operate covanta s facilities 
while covanta currently has all necessary operating approvals  covanta may not always be able to obtain all required regulatory approvals  and covanta may not be able to obtain any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals or maintain all required regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if covanta fails to obtain and comply with any required regulatory approvals  the operation of covanta s facilities or the sale of electricity to third parties could be prevented  made subject to additional regulation or subject covanta to additional costs 
the energy industry is becoming increasingly competitive  and covanta might not successfully respond to these changes 
covanta may not be able to respond in a timely or effective manner to the changes resulting in increased competition in the energy industry in both domestic and international markets 
these changes may include deregulation of the electric utility industry in some markets  privatization of the electric utility industry in other markets and increasing competition in all markets 
to the extent us competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of a commodity business  the economics of covanta s business may come under increasing pressure 
regulatory initiatives in foreign countries where covanta has or will have operations involve the same types of risks 
changes in laws and regulations affecting the solid waste and the energy industries could adversely affect covanta s business 
covanta s business is highly regulated 
covanta cannot predict whether the federal or state governments or foreign governments will adopt legislation or regulations relating to the solid waste or energy industries 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating and other costs to covanta  particularly with regard to enforcement efforts 
the introduction of new laws or other future regulatory developments that 
table of contents increase the costs of operation or capital to covanta may have a material adverse effect on covanta s business  financial condition or results of operations 
insurance services specific risks insurance regulations may affect naicc s operations 
the insurance industry is highly regulated 
naicc is subject to regulation by state and federal regulators  and a significant portion of naicc s operations are subject to regulation by the state of california 
changes in existing insurance regulations or adoption of new regulations or laws which could affect naicc s results of operations and financial condition may include  without limitation  proposed changes to california regulations regarding a broker s fiduciary duty to select the best carrier for an insured  extension of california s low cost automobile program beyond los angeles and san francisco counties and changes to california s workers compensation laws 
we cannot predict the impact of changes in existing insurance regulations or adoption of new regulations or laws on naicc s results of operations and financial condition 
the insurance products sold by naicc are subject to intense competition 
the insurance products sold by naicc are subject to intense competition from many competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than naicc 
the california non standard personal automobile marketplace consists of over carriers 
in order to decrease rates  insurers in california must obtain the prior permission for rate reductions from the california department of insurance 
in lieu of requesting rate decreases  competitors may soften underwriting standards as an alternative means of attracting new business 
such tactics  should they occur  would introduce new levels of risk for naicc and could limit naicc s ability to write new policies or renew existing profitable policies 
we cannot assure you that naicc will be able to successfully compete in these markets and generate sufficient premium volume at attractive prices to be profitable 
this risk is enhanced by the reduction in lines of business naicc writes as a result of its decision to reduce underwriting operations 
if naicc s loss experience exceeds its estimates  additional capital may be required 
unpaid losses and lae are based on estimates of reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported for reinsurance assumed  and historical company experience for unreported claims 
such liability is  by necessity  based on estimates that may change in the near term 
naicc cannot assure you that the ultimate liabilities will not exceed  or even materially exceed  the amounts estimated 
if the ultimate liability materially exceeds estimates  then additional capital may be required to be contributed to some of our insurance subsidiaries 
naicc and the other insurance subsidiaries received additional capital contributions from danielson in and and naicc cannot provide any assurance that it and its subsidiaries will be able to obtain such additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  due to the fact that naicc and its other insurance subsidiaries are in the process of running off several significant lines of business  the risk of adverse development and the subsequent requirement to obtain additional capital is heightened 
failure to satisfy capital adequacy and risk based capital requirements would require naicc to obtain additional capital 
naicc is subject to regulatory risk based capital requirements 
depending on its risk based capital  naicc could be subject to four levels of increasing regulatory intervention ranging from company action to mandatory control 
naicc s capital and surplus is also one factor used to determine its ability to distribute or loan funds to us 
if naicc has insufficient capital and surplus  as determined under the risk based capital test  it will need to obtain additional capital to establish additional reserves 
naicc cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to obtain such additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

table of contents risks related to the ref fuel acquisition we may be unable to integrate the operations of ref fuel and danielson successfully and may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend in part upon our ability to integrate the two companies businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
our attempt to integrate two companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges  and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully 
in particular  the necessity of coordinating organizations in additional locations and addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration 
the integration will require the dedication of significant management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from the day to day operations of the businesses of the combined company 
the process of integrating operations after the transaction could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the combined company s businesses and the loss of key personnel 
employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt the businesses of the combined company 
any inability of management to integrate the operations of ref fuel and danielson successfully could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of danielson 
we will incur significant transaction and combination related costs in connection with the transaction if the proposed transaction with ref fuel closes  we expect that danielson will be obligated to pay transaction fees and other expenses related to the transaction of approximately million  including financial advisors fees  legal and accounting fees  and fees and expenses to refinance the existing covanta recourse debt 
furthermore  we expect to incur significant costs  which we currently estimate to be approximately million  associated with combining the operations of the two companies 
however  we cannot predict the specific size of those charges before we begin the integration process 
although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs  as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses  we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved as planned in the near future  or at all 
failure to close the ref fuel acquisition may adversely affect the danielson s financial situation if danielson is unable to consummate its planned acquisition of ref fuel  danielson will have incurred substantial transaction fees and other expenses in connection with its pursuit of the transaction  without achieving the benefits of the acquisition 
if danielson s failure to close the ref fuel acquisition is due to danielson s failure to complete the ref fuel rights offering and the related financing for the transaction  and all other closing conditions are capable of being satisfied  then danielson must pay the selling stockholders of ref fuel a termination fee of million  no less than million of which must be paid in cash 
in addition  if we fail to close the transaction  the refinancing of covanta s existing recourse debt which is contemplated in connection with the acquisition will not occur 
covanta s and cpih s need to either satisfy their debts upon maturity or refinance them will continue and there can be no assurance that covanta or cpih will be able to refinance their respective debts on acceptable terms  or at all  or obtain sufficient cash to satisfy their debts at maturity 
fees payable in danielson s stock if ref fuel fails to close may have a dilutive effect on your interest if danielson fails to close the ref fuel acquisition due to danielson s failure to complete the ref fuel rights offering and the related financing for the transaction  and all other closing conditions are capable of being satisfied  then danielson must pay the selling stockholders of ref fuel a termination fee of million 
no less than million of this termination fee must be paid in cash and up to million the fee may be paid in stock at danielson s election  at price of per share 
in addition  in connection with their commitments to participate in the ref fuel rights offering and acquire their respective pro rata portions of the shares in the ref fuel rights offering  danielson has agreed to pay each of sz investments  tavf and laminar an amount equal to to of their respective equity commitments depending upon the timing of the transaction 
if the ref fuel rights offering is terminated or is not commenced before august   
table of contents danielson may elect to pay this amount to sz investments  tavf and laminar in the form of stock at a price based upon the day average closing price of danielson s stock following termination of the ref fuel rights offering or august  if the ref fuel rights offering has not commenced 
payment of these fees in danielson s common stock will have a dilutive effect on your relative ownership interest in our stock 
ref fuel s business model includes greater risk in the waste disposal market than does covanta s while covanta and ref fuel both sell energy pursuant to long term contracts  covanta typically sells a greater proportion of its aggregate waste processing capacity under long term contracts than does ref fuel 
consequently  more of ref fuel s revenue from its waste to energy facilities is subject to market risk from fluctuations in waste market prices than covanta s  and short term fluctuations in the waste markets may have a greater impact on the combined company s waste to energy revenues than on those of covanta alone 
employees as of december   danielson employed  full time employees worldwide  of which a majority is employed in the united states of danielson s employees in the united states  approximately are unionized 
currently  covanta is party to seven collective bargaining agreements one of these agreements is scheduled to expire in  two in  and one in with respect to the remaining three agreements which have recently expired  the company is in negotiations with the applicable collective bargaining representatives and covanta currently expects to reach an agreement with such representative to extend such agreement on its current or similar terms

danielson assesses the likelihood of potential losses on an ongoing basis and when losses are considered probable and reasonably estimable  records as a loss an estimate of the ultimate outcome

the final consequences of these proceedings are not presently determinable with certainty 
american commercial lines  inc the petition with the us bankruptcy court to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  that acl and many of its subsidiaries and its immediate direct parent entity  american commercial lines holdings  llc  filed on january  has resulted in the confirmation of a plan of reorganization on december  that was effective as of january  pursuant to acl s plan of reorganization acl is no longer a subsidiary of danielson as danielson s equity interest in acl was cancelled and it received 
table of contents warrants to purchase three percent of acl s new common stock 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
covanta energy corporation generally  claims and lawsuits against covanta and its subsidiaries that had filed bankruptcy petitions and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy arising from events occurring prior to their respective petition dates have been resolved pursuant to the reorganization plan  and have been discharged pursuant to the march  order of the bankruptcy court which confirmed  the reorganization plan 
however  to the extent that claims are not dischargeable in bankruptcy  such claims may not be discharged 
for example  the claims of certain persons who were personally injured prior to the petition date but whose injury only became manifest thereafter may not be discharged pursuant to the reorganization plan 
environmental matters covanta s operations are subject to environmental regulatory laws and environmental remediation laws 
although covanta s operations are occasionally subject to proceedings and orders pertaining to emissions into the environment and other environmental violations  which may result in fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations 
covanta may be identified  along with other entities  as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to cercla and or analogous state laws 
in certain instances  covanta may be exposed to joint and several liabilities for remedial action or damages 
covanta s ultimate liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors  including its volumetric share of waste  the total cost of remediation  the financial viability of other companies that also sent waste to a given site and  in the case of divested operations  its contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations 
generally such claims arising prior to the first petition date were resolved in and discharged by the chapter cases 
the potential costs related to the matters described below and the possible impact on future operations are uncertain due in part to the complexity of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  the varying costs and effectiveness of cleanup technologies  the uncertain level of insurance or other types of recovery and the questionable level of the company s responsibility 
although the ultimate outcome and expense of any litigation  including environmental remediation  is uncertain  the company believes that the following proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june   the epa named covanta s wholly owned subsidiary  ogden martin systems of haverhill  inc  now known as covanta haverhill  inc  as one of  potentially responsible parties prps at the beede waste oil superfund site  plaistow  new hampshire  a former waste oil recycling facility 
the total quantity of waste oil alleged by the epa to have been disposed of by prps at the beede site is approximately million gallons  of which covanta haverhill s contribution is alleged to be approximately  gallons 
on january   the epa signed its record of decision with respect to the cleanup of the site 
according to the epa  the costs of response actions incurred as of january by the epa and the state of new hampshire department of environmental services des total approximately million  and the estimated cost to implement the remedial alternative selected in the record of decision is an additional million 
covanta haverhill  inc is participating in discussions with other prps concerning the epa s selected remedy for the site  in anticipation of eventual settlement negotiations with the epa and des 
covanta haverhill  inc s share of liability  if any  cannot be determined at this time as a result of uncertainties regarding the source and scope of contamination  the large number of prps and the varying degrees of responsibility among various classes of prps 
the company believes that based on the amount of waste oil materials covanta haverhill  inc is alleged to have sent to the site  its liability will not be material 

table of contents other matters during the course of the chapter cases  covanta and certain contract counterparties reached agreement with respect to material restructuring of their mutual obligations in connection with several waste to energy projects 
subsequent to march  covanta were also involved in material disputes and or litigation with respect to the warren county  new jersey and lake county  florida waste to energy projects and the tampa bay water project 
during  all disputes relating to the lake county and tampa bay matters were resolved  and the company s subsidiaries involved in these projects emerged from bankruptcy 
as of december  covanta s subsidiaries involved with the warren county  new jersey project remain in chapter and are not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that the outcome of the warren county  new jersey litigation described below will not adversely affect the company 
the covanta subsidiary covanta warren which operates the waste to energy facility in warren county  new jersey the warren facility and the pollution control financing authority of warren county warren authority have been engaged in negotiations for an extended time concerning a potential restructuring of the parties rights and obligations under various agreements related to covanta warren s operation of the warren facility 
those negotiations were in part precipitated by a federal court of appeals decision invalidating certain of the state of new jersey s waste flow laws  which resulted in significantly reduced revenues for the warren facility 
since  the state of new jersey has been voluntarily making all debt service payments with respect to the project bonds issued to finance construction of the warren facility  and covanta warren has been operating the warren facility pursuant to an agreement with the warren authority which modifies the existing service agreement 
principal on the warren facility project debt is due annually in december of each year  while interest is due semi annually in june and december of each year 
the state of new jersey provided sufficient funds to the project bond trustee to pay principal and interest to bondholders during june although discussions continue  to date covanta warren and the warren authority have been unable to reach an agreement to restructure the contractual arrangements governing covanta warren s operation of the warren facility 
also as part of covanta s emergence from bankruptcy  covanta and covanta warren entered into several agreements approved by the bankruptcy court that permit covanta warren to reimburse covanta for employees and employee related expenses  provide for payment of a monthly allocated overhead expense reimbursement in a fixed amount and permit covanta to advance up to million in super priority debtor in possession loans to covanta warren in order to meet any liquidity needs 
as of december   covanta warren owed covanta million 
in the event the parties are unable to timely reach agreement upon and consummate a restructuring of the contractual arrangements governing covanta warren s operation of the warren facility  the debtors may  among other things  elect to litigate with counterparties to certain agreements with covanta warren  assume or reject one or more executory contracts related to the warren facility  attempt to file a plan of reorganization on a non consensual basis  or liquidate covanta warren 
in such an event  creditors of covanta warren may receive little or no recovery on account of their claims

high low close high low close first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter danielson has not paid dividends on its common stock and does not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
under current financing arrangements there are material restrictions on the ability of danielson s subsidiaries to transfer funds to danielson in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances that would likely materially limit the future payment of dividends on common stock 
see item management s discussion  and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more detailed information on our credit agreements

at the time that danielson entered into the note purchase agreement  agreed to issue the notes convertible into shares of common stock and issued the equity compensation to the bridge lenders  the closing price of the common stock on the american stock exchange on the day prior to announcement of the covanta acquisition was per share  which was below the per share conversion price of the notes 
pursuant to their terms  the notes were convertible into common stock at a price of per share without action by the bridge lenders if all or any portion of the notes are not repaid pursuant to a rights offering  subject to certain agreed upon limitations necessitated by danielson s nols 
in addition  under the note purchase agreement  laminar agreed to convert an amount of convertible notes in order to acquire up to an additional million shares of the common stock at per share based upon the levels of public participation in the rights offering 
danielson issued the maximum of million shares to laminar pursuant to the conversion of approximately million in principal amount of notes 
consequently  the million principal amount of notes held by laminar plus accrued but unpaid interest was repaid in full on june  through the issuance of million shares of danielson common stock to laminar and million of the proceeds from the rights offering 
the bridge lenders were all sophisticated investors that conducted due diligence on danielson and were either affiliated with members of  or had the opportunity to ask questions of  management in connection with the drafting and negotiation of the note purchase agreement 
the issuance of the common stock issued to the bridge lenders was exempt from registration pursuant to private offering exemption of section of the securities act of  as amended

executive summary danielson is organized as a holding company with substantially all of its operations conducted in the insurance services industry prior to the acquisition of covanta s energy business 
as a result of the consummation of the covanta acquisition on march   the future performance of danielson will predominantly reflect the performance of covanta s operations which are significantly larger than danielson s insurance operations 
throughout  danielson also had subsidiaries engaged in the marine services industry which  beginning in  were accounted for under the equity method 
most of these subsidiaries were involved in the bankruptcy proceeding of acl  pursuant to which these subsidiaries were sold or reorganized 
on december  a plan of reorganization was confirmed without any material conditions and on january   these subsidiaries emerged from bankruptcy  and danielson s ownership interests in acl were cancelled and it received warrants to purchase three percent of acl s new common stock from certain creditors of acl 
during  dhc owned a direct interest in gms and a direct interest in vessel leasing 
neither of these two companies filed for chapter protection 
gms was a joint venture among acl  danielson and a third party  which owned and operated marine terminals and warehouse operations 
vessel leasing was a joint venture between acl and danielson which leased barges to acl s barge transportation operations 
danielson  gms and vessel leasing were not guarantors of acl s debt nor were they liable for any of acl s liabilities 
on october   danielson and acl sold their interest in gms to a third party joint venture member  and on january  danielson sold its interest in vessel leasing to acl 
as a result  danielson no longer is engaged in the marine services business 
the nature of danielson s business  the risks attendant to such business and the trends that it will face have been significantly altered by the acquisition of covanta and disposition of its marine services business 
accordingly  danielson s prior financial performance will not be comparable with its future performance and readers are directed to management s discussion and analysis of covanta s business below for a discussion of management s perspective on important factors of operating and financial performance 
in addition to the risks attendant to the operation of the covanta energy business in the future and the integration of covanta and its employees into danielson  the ability of danielson to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income generated by the covanta operations will have a material affect on danielson s financial condition and results of operations 
nols predominantly arose from predecessor insurance entities of mission insurance group inc as more fully described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements and losses incurred in connection with the acl investment 
danielson had nols estimated to be approximately million for federal income tax purposes as of the end of the nols will expire in various amounts from december  through december   if not used 
the amount of nols available to covanta will be reduced by any taxable income generated by current members of danielson s tax consolidated group 
the irs has not audited any of danielson s tax returns 
a portion of danielson s nols were utilized in as a result of income danielson recognized in connection with acl s emergence from bankruptcy business as described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  covanta s operations and from income from certain grantor trusts relating to danielson s historic insurance 
if danielson were to undergo  an ownership change as such term is used in section of the internal revenue code  the use of its nols would be limited 
danielson will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is a more than increase in stock ownership during a year testing period by five percent stockholders 
danielson s certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions that were designed to help preserve danielson s nols by avoiding an ownership change 
the transfer restrictions were 
table of contents implemented in  and danielson expects that they will remain in force as long as danielson has nols 
danielson cannot be certain  however  that these restrictions will prevent an ownership change 
danielson  on a parent only basis  has continuing expenditures for administrative expenses and derives income primarily from investment returns on portfolio securities 
therefore  the analysis of danielson s results of operations and financial condition is generally done on a business segment basis 
danielson s long term strategic and business objective is to enhance the value of its investment in covanta  and acquire businesses that will allow danielson to earn an attractive return on its investments 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition has been prepared on a business segment basis 
danielson s business segments are covanta s energy business  insurance operations  and danielson s corporate parent activities 
separate discussion and analysis of each segment s results of operation and liquidity and capital resources are included herein 
the results of operations from covanta are included in danielson s consolidated results of operations from march  however  given the significance of the covanta acquisition to danielson s future results of operations and financial condition  the energy business segment discussion includes combined information for the year ended december  as compared to predecessor information for the year ended december  in order to provide a more informative comparison of results 
predecessor information refers to financial information of covanta and its subsidiaries pertaining to periods prior to danielson s acquisition of covanta on march  separate discussion and analysis is provided below with respect to danielson s parent only operations  as well as those of its energy and insurance segments 
management s discussion and analysis of parent only operations as discussed below  on february   danielson announced its proposed acquisition of ref fuel 
upon closing of the proposed acquisition  ref fuel will be a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta 
the acquisition will markedly increase the size and scale of covanta s waste to energy business  and thus danielson s business 
it will also provide covanta with the opportunity to achieve cost savings by combining the businesses  as well as the opportunity to refinance its existing corporate debt  thereby lowering its cost of capital and obtaining less restrictive covenants than under its current financing arrangements 
if the purchase agreement is terminated with ref fuel because of our failure to complete the ref fuel rights offering and financing as described below  and all other closing conditions are capable of being satisfied  then we must pay the to selling stockholders of ref fuel a termination fee of million  of which no less than million shall be paid in cash and of which up to million may be paid in shares of danielson s common stock  at danielson s election  based upon a price of per share 
as of the date of the purchase agreement danielson entered into a registration rights agreement granting registration rights to such owners with respect to such stock  and deposited million in cash in an escrow account pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement 
danielson intends to finance this transaction through a combination of debt and equity financing 
the equity component of the financing is expected to consist of an approximately million pro rata  registered offering of warrants or other rights to purchase danielson s common stock to all of danielson s existing stockholders at per share 
in the ref fuel rights offering  danielson s existing stockholders will be issued rights to purchase danielson s stock on a pro rata basis  with each holder entitled to purchase approximately shares of danielson s common stock at an exercise price of per full share for each share of danielson s common stock then held 
three of danielson s largest stockholders  sz investments  tavf  and laminar  representing ownership of approximately of danielson s outstanding common stock  have each severally committed to participate in the ref fuel rights offering and acquire their pro rata portion of the shares 

table of contents as a consideration for their commitments  danielson will pay each of these stockholders an amount equal to to of their respective equity commitments  depending on the timing of the transaction 
danielson agreed to amend an existing registration rights agreement to provide these stockholders with the right to demand that we undertake an underwritten offering within twelve months of the closing acquisition of ref fuel in order to provide such stockholders with liquidity 
the acquisition and financing are expected to close during the second quarter of management is currently focused on obtaining all required regulatory approvals and obtaining financing for the transaction 
there can be no assurance that the proposed acquisition or its related financings will be completed 
as a result of acl s bankruptcy filing  while danielson continued to exercise influence over the operating and financial policies of acl throughout  it no longer maintained control of acl 
accordingly  for the years ended december  and  danielson accounted for its investments in acl  gms and vessel leasing using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  danielson reports its share of the equity investees income or loss based on its ownership interest 
as a result of acl s continued losses and danielson management s belief that it would recover little  if any  of its investment in acl  danielson wrote off its remaining investment in acl during the first quarter of the equity in net loss of unconsolidated marine services subsidiaries included a loss from acl of million  an other than temporary impairment of the remaining investment in acl of million and income from gms and vessel leasing of million 
the gms and vessel leasing investments were not considered to be impaired 
the marine services subsidiaries operating results in were consolidated in danielson s operating results from the date of acquisition  may   through december   but were deconsolidated in as a result of acl s bankruptcy

parent company expenses were primarily the result of the corporate services agreement between danielson and covanta  pursuant to which danielson provides to covanta  at covanta s expense  certain administrative and professional services and covanta pays most of danielson s expenses 
such expenses totaled million for the period march  through december  in addition  danielson and covanta have entered into an agreement pursuant to which covanta provides  at danielson s expense  payroll and benefit services for danielson employees  which totaled million for the period march  through december  parent expenses vs

as described below under covanta s capital resources and commitments and covanta s liquidity  domestic covanta and cpih have separate recourse debt 
in its domestic segment  covanta designs  constructs and operates key infrastructure for municipalities and others in waste to energy and independent power production 
domestic covanta s principal business  from which covanta earns most of its revenue  is the operation of waste to energy facilities 
waste to energy facilities combust municipal solid waste as a means of environmentally sound waste disposal  and produce energy that is sold as electricity or steam to utilities and other purchasers 
domestic covanta generally operates waste to energy facilities under long term contracts with municipal clients 
some of these facilities are owned by domestic covanta  while others are owned by the municipal client or other third parties 
for those facilities owned by it  domestic covanta retains the ability to operate such projects after current contracts expire 
for those facilities not owned by domestic covanta  municipal clients generally have the contractual right  but not the obligation  to extend the contract and continue to retain domestic covanta s service after the initial expiration date 
for all waste to energy projects  domestic covanta receives revenue from two primary sources fees it charges for processing waste received  and payments for electricity and steam 

table of contents in addition to its waste to energy projects  domestic covanta operates  and in some cases has ownership interests in  other renewable energy projects which generate electricity from wood waste  landfill gas and hydroelectric resources 
the electricity from these projects is sold to utilities 
for these projects  domestic covanta receives revenue from electricity sales  and in some projects cash from equity distributions 
domestic covanta also operates one water project  which produces potable water that is distributed by a municipal entity 
for this project  domestic covanta receives revenue from service fees it charges the municipal entity 
domestic covanta previously had operated several small waste water treatment projects pursuant to contractual arrangements with municipal entities or other customers 
during  domestic covanta s operating contracts for these projects were either terminated or transferred to third parties 
the termination of these operations did not have a material effect on covanta 
covanta does not expect to grow its water business  and may consider further divestitures 
in its international segment as of december   cpih has ownership interests in  and or operates  independent power production facilities in the philippines  china  bangladesh  india  and costa rica and one waste to energy facility in italy 
during the third quarter of  it sold its interest in one project in spain 
the costa rica facilities generate electricity from hyrdroelectric resources while the other independent power production facilities generate electricity and steam by combusting coal  natural gas or heavy fuel oil 
for these projects  cpih receives revenue from operating fees  electricity and steam sales and in some cases cash from equity distributions 
optimizing covanta s cash an important objective of management is to provide reliable service to its clients while generating sufficient cash to meet its debt service and other liquidity needs 
maintaining historic facility production and optimizing cash receipts is necessary to assure that covanta has sufficient cash to fund operations  make appropriate and permitted capital expenditures and meet scheduled debt service payments under its current principal financing arrangements 
under its current principal financing arrangements  covanta does not currently expect to receive any cash contributions from danielson  and is prohibited  under its principal financing arrangements  from using its cash to issue dividends to danielson 
covanta believes that when combined with its other sources of liquidity  domestic covanta s operations should generate sufficient cash to meet operational needs  capital expenditures and debt service due prior to maturity on its recourse debt 
therefore in order to optimize cash flows  management believes it must seek to continue to operate and maintain domestic covanta s facilities consistent with historical performance levels  and to avoid increases in overhead and operating expenses in view of the largely fixed nature of domestic covanta s revenues 
management will also seek to maintain or enhance domestic covanta s cash flow from renewals or replacement of existing contracts which begin to expire in october and from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities 
domestic covanta s ability to grow cash flows by investing in new projects is limited by debt covenants in its principal financing agreements  and by the scarcity of opportunities for new waste to energy facilities 
covanta believes that cpih s operations should also generate sufficient cash to meet its operational needs  capital expenditures and debt service prior to maturity on its recourse debt 
however  due to risks inherent in foreign operations  cpih s receipt of cash distributions can be less regular and predictable than that of domestic covanta 
management believes that it must continue to operate and maintain cpih s facilities consistent with historical performance levels to enable its subsidiaries to comply with respective debt covenants and make cash distributions to cpih 
it will also seek to refinance its corporate indebtedness  or sell existing projects in an amount sufficient to repay such indebtedness  at or prior to its maturity in march in those jurisdictions where its subsidiaries energy purchasers  fuel suppliers or contractors may experience difficulty in meeting payment or performance obligations on a timely basis  cpih must seek arrangements which permit the subsidiary to meet all of its obligations 
cpih s ability to grow by investing in new projects is limited by debt covenants in its principal financing agreements 
domestic covanta and cpih each emerged from bankruptcy with material amounts of corporate debt 
as of december   domestic covanta had outstanding recourse debt in the principal amount of 
table of contents million  comprised of i secured notes due in in the amount of million accreting to million at maturity and ii unsecured notes due in the amount of million which are estimated to increase to approximately million through the issuance of additional notes 
as of december   domestic covanta also had credit facilities for liquidity and the issuance of letters of credit in the amount of million  which credit facilities expire in as of december   cpih had outstanding recourse debt in the principal amount of million and credit facilities for liquidity in the amount of million 
additional information on domestic covanta s and cpih s debt and credit facilities is provided below in capital resources and commitments and in liquidity 
creditors under domestic covanta s debt and credit facilities do not have recourse to cpih  and creditors under cpih s debt and credit facilities do not have recourse to domestic covanta 
cash generated by domestic covanta businesses is managed and held separately from cash generated by cpih businesses 
therefore  under current financing arrangements  the assets and cash flow of each of domestic covanta and cpih are not available to the other  either to repay the debt or to satisfy other obligations 
domestic covanta s ability to optimize its cash flow should be enhanced under the tax sharing agreement with danielson 
this agreement provides that danielson will file a federal tax return for its consolidated group of companies  including the subsidiaries which comprise domestic covanta  and that certain of danielson s nols will be available to offset the federal tax liability of domestic covanta 
consequently  domestic covanta s federal income tax obligations will be substantially reduced 
covanta is not obligated to make any payments to danielson with respect to the use of these nols 
the nols will expire in varying amounts from december  through december  if not used 
the irs has not audited danielson s tax returns 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding danielson s nols and factors which may affect its availability to offset taxable income of domestic covanta 
if the nols were not available to offset the federal income tax liability of domestic covanta  domestic covanta may not have sufficient cash flow available to pay debt service on the domestic covanta corporate credit facilities 
because cpih is not included as a member of danielson s consolidated taxpayer group  the tax sharing agreement does not benefit it 
refinancing covanta s and cpih s corporate debt management believes that demonstrating domestic covanta s ability to maintain consistent and substantial cash available for corporate debt service and letter of credit fees will enable it to refinance its corporate debt  as well as attract alternative sources of credit 
refinancing domestic covanta s credit facilities may enable it to reduce the costs of its indebtedness and letters of credit  remove or relax restrictive covenants and provide domestic covanta with the additional flexibility to exploit appropriate growth opportunities in the future 
covanta also believes that operating cash flows will not be sufficient to repay the high yield notes at maturity in accordingly  covanta will have to derive such funds from refinancing  asset sales  or other sources 
domestic covanta may refinance  without prepayment premium  the high yield notes prior to march  in addition  domestic covanta has three letter of credit facilities under which it obtained letters of credit required under agreements with customers and others 
these facilities are of shorter duration than the related obligation of domestic covanta to provide letters of credit 
domestic covanta will have to renew or replace these facilities in order to meet such obligations 
cpih s corporate debt matures in march cpih believes that its operating cash flows alone will not be sufficient to repay this debt at maturity 
accordingly  cpih will have to derive such funds from refinancing  asset sales  or other sources 
as described below in proposed refinancing  danielson has received commitments to refinance both domestic covanta s and cpih s recourse debt 
if it is able to close such refinancing  the company expects to achieve both a lower overall cost with respect to its existing recourse debt and less restrictive covenants than under its current financing arrangements 

table of contents covanta s earnings covanta s emergence from bankruptcy did not affect the operating performance of its facilities or their ability to generate cash 
however  as a result of the application of fresh start and purchase accounting adjustments required upon covanta s emergence from bankruptcy and acquisition by danielson  the carrying value of covanta s assets was adjusted to reflect their current estimated fair value based on discounted anticipated cash flows and estimates of management in consultation with valuation experts 
these adjustments will result in future changes in non cash items such as depreciation and amortization which will not be consistent with the amounts of such items for prior periods 
such future changes for post emergence periods may affect earnings as compared to pre emergence periods 
in addition  covanta s consolidated financial statements have been further adjusted to deconsolidate its subsidiaries that remain in bankruptcy remaining debtors from the consolidated group until they emerged or were disposed of after march  although management has endeavored to use its best efforts to make appropriate estimates of value  the estimation process is subject to inherent limitations and is based upon the preliminary work of covanta and its valuation consultants 
moreover  under applicable accounting principles to the extent that relevant information remains to be developed and fully evaluated  such preliminary estimates may be adjusted during the year following emergence from chapter and acquisition by danielson 
the adjusted values assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets may affect covanta s gaap earnings 
domestic covanta owns certain waste to energy facilities for which the debt service principal and interest on project debt is expressly included as a component of the service fee paid by the municipal client 
as of december   the principal amount of project debt outstanding with respect to these projects was approximately million 
in accordance with gaap  regardless of the actual amounts paid by the municipal client with respect to this component  covanta records revenues with respect thereto based on levelized principal payments during the contract term  which are then discounted to reflect when the principal payments are actually paid by the municipal client 
accordingly  the amount of revenues recorded does not equal the actual payment of this component by the municipal client in any given contract year and the difference between the two methods gives rise to the unbilled service receivable recorded on covanta s balance sheet 
the interest expense component of the debt service payment is recorded based upon the actual amount of this component paid by the municipal client 
covanta also owns two waste to energy projects for which debt service is not expressly included in the fee it is paid 
rather  covanta receives a fee for each ton of waste processed at these projects 
as of december   the principal amount of project debt outstanding with respect to these projects was approximately million 
accordingly  domestic covanta does not record revenue reflecting principal on this project debt 
its operating subsidiaries for these projects make equal monthly deposits with their respective project trustees in amounts sufficient for the trustees to pay principal and interest when due 
covanta operating performance and seasonality covanta has historically performed its operating obligations without experiencing material unexpected service interruptions or incurring material increases in costs 
in addition  in its contracts at domestic projects domestic covanta generally has limited its exposure for risks not within its control 
for additional information about such risks and damages that domestic covanta may owe for its unexcused operating performance failures  see risk factors included in part i  item in monitoring and assessing the ongoing operating and financial performance of covanta s domestic businesses  management focuses on certain key factors tons of waste processed  electricity and steam sold and boiler availability 
a material portion of covanta s domestic service revenues and energy revenues is relatively predictable because it is derived from long term contracts where domestic covanta receives a fixed operating fee which escalates over time and a portion typically of energy revenues 
domestic covanta receives these revenues for performing to base contractual standards  including standards for waste processing and energy generation efficiency 
these standards vary among contracts  and at three of its domestic waste to energy 
table of contents projects covanta receives service revenue based entirely on the amount of waste processed instead of a fixed operating fee  and retains of energy revenues generated 
in addition  domestic covanta has benefited during from historically favorable pricing in energy and scrap metals markets 
domestic covanta may receive material additional service and energy revenue if its domestic waste to energy projects operate at levels exceeding these contractual standards 
its ability to meet or exceed such standards at its domestic projects  and its general financial performance  is affected by the following seasonal or long term changes in market prices for waste  energy  or scrap metals  for projects where domestic covanta sells into those markets  seasonal  geographic and other variations in the heat content of waste processed  and thereby the amount of waste that can be processed by a waste to energy facility  its ability to avoid unexpected increases in operating and maintenance costs while ensuring that adequate facility maintenance is conducted so that historic levels of operating performance can be sustained  contract counter parties ability to fulfill their obligations  including the ability of domestic covanta s various municipal customers to supply waste in contractually committed amounts  and the availability of alternate or additional sources of waste if excess processing capacity exists at domestic covanta s facilities  and the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover losses from business interruption in the event of casualty or other insured events 
covanta s quarterly income from domestic operations within the same fiscal year typically differs substantially due to seasonal factors  primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled plant maintenance and the receipt of annual incentive fees  at many waste to energy facilities 
domestic covanta usually conducts scheduled maintenance twice each year at each of its domestic facilities  which requires that individual boiler units temporarily cease operations 
during these scheduled maintenance periods  domestic covanta incurs material repair and maintenance expenses and receives less revenue  until the boiler units resume operations 
this scheduled maintenance typically occurs during periods of off peak electric demand in the spring and fall 
the spring scheduled maintenance period generally occurs during february  march and april and is typically more comprehensive and costly than the work conducted during the fall maintenance period  which usually occurs between mid september and mid november 
as a result  domestic covanta has typically incurred its highest maintenance expense in the first quarter 
domestic covanta earns annual incentive revenues at most of its waste to energy projects by processing waste during each contract year in excess of certain contractual levels 
as a result  such revenues are recognized if the annual performance threshold has been achieved  which can occur only near the end of each respective contract year 
many contract years coincide with the applicable municipal client s fiscal year  and as a result  the majority of this incentive revenue has historically been recognized in the second quarter and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter 
given the seasonal factors discussed above relating to its domestic business  domestic covanta has typically experienced its highest operating income from its domestic projects during the second quarter and lowest operating income during the first quarter 
covanta s cash provided by domestic operating activities also varies seasonally 
generally  cash provided by domestic operating activities follows income with a one to two month timing delay for maintenance expense payables and incentive revenue receivables 
in addition  most capital expense projects are conducted during the scheduled maintenance periods 
further  certain substantial operating expenses are accrued consistently each month throughout the year while the corresponding cash payments are made only a few times each year 
generally  the first quarter is negatively impacted to some extent as a result of such seasonal payments 
these factors typically have caused domestic covanta s operating cash flow from its domestic projects to be the lowest during the first quarter and the highest during the third quarter 

table of contents covanta s annual and quarterly financial performance can be affected by many factors  several of which are outside domestic covanta s control as are noted above 
these factors can overshadow the seasonal dynamics described herein  particularly  with regard to quarterly cash from operations  which can be materially affected by changes in working capital 
cpih operating performance and seasonality management believes that it must continue to operate and maintain cpih s facilities consistent with historical performance levels to enable its subsidiaries to comply with respective debt covenants and make cash distributions to cpih 
in monitoring and assessing the ongoing performance of cpih s businesses  management focuses primarily on electricity sold and plant availability at its projects 
several of cpih s facilities  unlike covanta s domestic facilities  generate electricity for sale only during periods when requested by the contract counterparty to the power purchase agreement 
at such facilities  cpih receives payments to compensate it for providing this capacity  whether or not electricity is actually delivered  if and when required 
cpih s financial performance is also impacted by changes in project efficiency due to equipment performance or auxiliary load  changes in fuel price for projects in which such costs are not completely passed through to the electricity purchaser through tariff adjustments  or delays in the effectiveness of tariff adjustments  the amounts of electricity actually requested by purchasers of electricity  and whether when such requests are made  cpih s facilities are then available to deliver such electricity  its ability to avoid unexpected increases in operating and maintenance costs while ensuring that adequate facility maintenance is conducted so that historic levels of operating performance can be sustained  the financial condition and creditworthiness of purchasers of power and services provided by cpih  fluctuations in the value of the domestic currency against the value of the us dollar for projects in which cpih is paid in whole or in part in the domestic currency of the host country  restrictions in repatriating dividends from the host country  and political risks associated with international projects 
cpih s quarterly income from operations and equity income vary based on seasonal factors  primarily as a result of the scheduling of plant maintenance at the quezon and chinese facilities and lower electricity sales during the chinese holidays 
the annual major scheduled maintenance for the quezon facility is typically planned for the first or early second quarter of each fiscal year  which reduces cpih equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries during that period 
boiler maintenance at cpih s chinese facilities typically occurs in either the first or second fiscal quarters  which increases expense and reduces revenue 
in addition  electricity sales are lower in the first quarter due to lower demand during the chinese new year 
as a result of these seasonal factors  income from cpih will typically be higher during the second half of the year compared to the first half 
cash distribution from operating subsidiaries and partnerships to cpih also vary seasonally but are generally unrelated to income seasonality 
cpih receives on a monthly basis modest distributions of operating fees 
in addition  cpih receives partnership distributions  which are typically prescribed by project debt documents and occur no more than several times per year for each project 
scheduled cash distributions from the quezon and haripur facilities  which are material  occur during the second and fourth quarters 
as a result cpih s cash available to service the cpih term loan is typically much greater during the second and fourth quarters than during the first and third quarters 
cpih s annual and quarterly financial performance can be affected by many factors several of which are outside cpih s control as noted above

the mandatory prepayment provisions  affirmative covenants  negative covenants and events of default under the cpih term loan facility are similar to those found in the first lien facility and the second lien facility described below 
other commitments 
covanta s other commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands of dollars commitments expiring by period less than more than total one year one year letters of credit surety bonds total other commitments net the letters of credit were issued pursuant to the facilities described below under liquidity to secure the company s performance under various contractual undertakings related to its domestic and international 
table of contents projects  or to secure obligations under its insurance program 
each letter of credit relating to a project is required to be maintained in effect for the period specified in related project contracts  and generally may be drawn if it is not renewed prior to expiration of that period 
two of these letters of credit relate to a waste to energy project and are provided under the first lien facility 
this facility currently provides for letters of credit in the amount of approximately million and generally reduces semi annually as the related contractual requirement reduces until  when the letters of credit are no longer contractually required to be maintained 
the other letters of credit are provided under the second lien facility and one unsecured letter of credit facility  in support of domestic covanta s businesses and to continue existing letters of credit required by cpih s businesses 
some of these letters of credit reduce over time as well  and one of such reducing letters of credit may be cancelled if covanta receives an investment grade rating from both moody s investors service and standard poor s 
as of december   domestic covanta had approximately million in available capacity for additional letters of credit under the second lien facility 
the following table describes the reduction in letter of credit requirements  through  for all existing letters of credit  the table does not include amounts with respect to new letters of credit that may be issued in thousands of dollars december  total first lien lcs total second lien lcs total other lcs total combined lcs covanta believes that it will be able to fully perform its contracts to which these letters of credit relate  and that it is unlikely that letters of credit would be drawn because of a default of its performance obligations 
if any of covanta s letters of credit were to be drawn under its current debt facilities  the amount drawn would be immediately repayable to the issuing bank 
the surety bonds listed on the table above relate to performance under its former waste water treatment operating contracts million and possible closure costs for various energy projects when such projects cease operating million 
were these bonds to be drawn upon  covanta would ordinarily have a contractual obligation to indemnify the surety company 
however  since these indemnity obligations arose prior to covanta s bankruptcy filing  the surety companies indemnity claims would entitle them to share only in a limited distribution along with other unsecured creditors under the reorganization plan 
because such claims share in a fixed distribution under the reorganization plan  covanta expects that any such distribution will not affect the obligations of domestic covanta or cpih 
the sureties may have additional rights to make claims against retainage or other funds owed to covanta with respect to projects for which surety bonds were issued 
covanta expects that enforcement of such rights will not have any material impact upon results of operations and financial condition of domestic covanta or cpih 
covanta and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations undertaken mainly pursuant to agreements to construct and operate certain energy and water facilities 
with respect to its domestic businesses  covanta has issued guarantees to municipal clients and other parties that covanta s subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
such contractual damages or other obligations could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
for facilities owned by municipal clients and operated by covanta  covanta s potential maximum liability as of december  associated with the repayment of the municipalities debt on such facilities is in excess of billion 
this amount was not recorded as a liability in danielson s consolidated balance sheet as of december  as covanta believes that it had not incurred such liability at the date of the financial statements 
additionally  
table of contents damages payable under such guarantees on covanta owned waste to energy facilities could expose covanta to recourse liability on project debt shown on the foregoing table 
covanta also believes that it has not incurred such damages at the date of the financial statements 
if covanta is asked to perform under one or more of such guarantees  its liability for damages upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt  which is presently not estimable 
with respect to its international businesses  covanta has issued guarantees of certain of cpih s operating subsidiaries contractual obligations to operate power projects 
the potential damages owed under such arrangements for international projects may be material 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such domestic and international damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than covanta s then available sources of funds 
to date  covanta has not incurred material liabilities under its guarantees  either on domestic or international projects 
covanta s liquidity an important objective of management is to provide reliable service to its clients while generating sufficient cash to meet its liquidity needs 
maintaining historic facility production and optimizing cash receipts is necessary to assure that the company has sufficient cash to fund operations  make appropriate and permitted capital expenditures and meet scheduled debt service payments 
under its current principal financing arrangements  covanta does not expect to receive any cash contributions from danielson and is prohibited  under its principal financing arrangements  from using its cash to issue dividends to danielson 
at december   domestic covanta had million in unrestricted cash 
restricted funds held in trust largely reflects payments from municipal clients under service agreements as the part of the service fee due reflecting debt service 
these payments are made directly to the trustee for the related project debt and are held by it until paid to project debt holders 
covanta does not have access to these funds 
in addition  as of december   domestic covanta had million in cash held in restricted accounts to pay for additional emergence expenses that are estimated to be paid after emergence 
cash held in such reserve accounts is not available for general corporate purposes 
during the year  cpih made payments of million to reduce outstanding principal on its term loan  a portion of which was funded by the sale of its interest in an energy facility in spain 
at december   cpih had million in its domestic accounts 
cpih also had million related to cash held in foreign bank accounts that could be difficult to transfer to the us due to the i requirements of the relevant project financing documents  ii applicable laws affecting the foreign project  iii contractual obligations  and iv prevention of material adverse tax liabilities to covanta and subsidiaries 
while cpih s existing term loan and revolver are outstanding cpih s cash balance is not available to be transferred to domestic covanta 
cpih s receipt of cash distributions can be less consistent and predictable than that of domestic covanta because of restrictions associated with project financing arrangements at the project level and other risks inherent with foreign operations 
as a result of these factors  cpih may have sufficient cash during some months to pay principal on its corporate debt  but have insufficient cash to pay principal during other months 
to the extent that cpih has insufficient cash in a given month to pay the full amount of interest then due on its term loan facility at the rate of  it is permitted to pay up to of such interest in kind  which amount is added to the principal amount outstanding

covanta believes cash available to cpih and its subsidiaries  together with borrowing under the cpih revolver will provide cpih with sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs and pay required debt service due prior to maturity 
covanta believes that cpih will need to refinance its indebtedness at or prior to maturity in march unless asset sales affected prior to such time are sufficient to repay all cpih indebtedness 
although danielson has received a commitment to refinance the cpih recourse debt  there can be no assurance that cpih will be able to refinance such indebtedness at maturity or that such assets sales will be sufficient to repay cpih indebtedness prior to its maturity

in connection with the debt financing commitments of goldman sachs credit partners  llp and credit suisse first boston  danielson has agreed to establish a dedicated cash reserve to be used if necessary to contribute capital into naicc in order to maintain certain risk based capital ratios 
danielson estimates such reserve will be funded with approximately million in cash at closing of the financing 
the acquisition of ref fuel and the refinancing of covanta s and cpih s existing corporate debt are or will be subject to numerous conditions 
these include successful closing of the ref fuel rights offering  receipt of all regulatory approvals  and the absence of material adverse changes to covanta s and ref fuel s businesses 
danielson will incur no fees or obligations to goldman sachs credit partners  llp  credit suisse first boston  or any other lenders seeking to participate in the proposed debt financing or refinancing  if the acquisition  or the related financing or refinancing does not occur

other quezon power manila electric company meralco  the sole power purchaser for covanta s quezon project  is engaged in discussions and legal proceedings with instrumentalities of the government of the philippines relating to past billings to its customers  cancellations of recent tariff increases  and potential tariff increases 
the outcome of these proceedings may affect meralco s financial condition 
quezon project management continues to negotiate with meralco with respect to proposed amendments to the power purchase agreement to modify certain commercial terms under the existing contract  and to resolve issues relating to the quezon project s performance during its first year of operation 
following the first year of the operation  in  based on a claim that the plant s performance did not merit full payment  meralco withheld a portion of each of several monthly payments to the quezon project that were due under the terms of the power purchase agreement 
the total withheld amount was million 
although the quezon project was able to pay all of its debt service and operational costs  the withholding by meralco constituted a default by meralco under the power purchase agreement and a potential event of default under the project financing agreements 
to address this issue  quezon project management agreed with project lenders to hold back cash from distributions in excess of the reserve requirements under the financing agreements in the amount of approximately million 
in addition to the issues under the power purchase agreement  issues under the financing agreements arose during late and regarding compliance with the quezon project operational parameters and the quezon project s inability to obtain required insurance coverage 
in october  covanta and other quezon project participants  with the consent of the quezon project lenders  amended certain of the quezon project documents to address such operational matters  resolving all related contract issues 
subsequently  the 
table of contents project lenders granted a waiver with respect to the insurance coverage issue because contractual coverage levels were not then commercially available on reasonable terms 
at approximately the same time  quezon project management sought  and successfully obtained  a reduction of the hold back amount discussed above  resulting in a new excess hold back of approximately million with effect from november adverse developments in meralco s financial condition or delays in finalizing the power purchase agreement amendments and potential consequent lender actions are not expected to adversely affect covanta s liquidity  although it may have a material affect on cpih s ability to repay its debt prior to maturity 
in late  meralco successfully refinanced million in expiring short term debt on a long term year basis  improving meralco s financial condition 
insurance danielson has obtained insurance for its assets and operations that provide coverage for what danielson believes are probable maximum losses  subject to self insured retentions  policy limits and premium costs which danielson believes to be appropriate 
however  the insurance obtained does not cover danielson for all possible losses 
off balance sheet arrangements during  subsidiaries of covanta were parties to lease arrangements with covanta s municipal clients at its union county  new jersey and its alexandria  virginia waste to energy facilities 
at its union county facility  covanta s operating subsidiary leases the facility from the union county utilities authority the ucua under a lease that expires in  which covanta may extend for an additional five years 
rent under the lease is sufficient to allow the ucua to repay tax exempt bonds issued by it to finance the facility and which mature in at its alexandria facility  a covanta subsidiary is a party to a lease related to certain pollution control equipment that was required in connection with the clean air act amendments of  and which were financed by the city of alexandria and by arlington county  virginia 
covanta s subsidiary owns this facility  and rent under this lease is sufficient to pay debt service on tax exempt bonds issued to finance such equipment and which mature in covanta is also a party to lease arrangements pursuant to which it leases rolling stock in connection with its waste to energy and independent power facilities  as well as certain office equipment 
rent payable under these arrangements is not material to the company s financial condition 
covanta generally uses operating lease treatment for all of the foregoing arrangements 
a summary of the company s operating lease obligations is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
covanta and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations undertaken mainly pursuant to agreements to construct and operate certain energy and water facilities 
with respect to its domestic businesses  covanta has issued guarantees to municipal clients and other parties that covanta s subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
such contractual damages or other obligations could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
for facilities owned by municipal clients and operated by covanta  covanta s potential maximum liability as of december  associated with the repayment of the municipalities debt on such facilities is in excess of billion 
this amount was not recorded as a liability in danielson s consolidated balance sheet as of december  as covanta believes that it had not incurred such liability at the date of the financial statements 
additionally  damages payable under such guarantees on covanta owned waste to energy facilities could expose covanta to liability under the limited recourse provisions on project debt related to its facilities 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to covanta s project debt 
covanta also believes that it has not incurred such damages at the date of the financial statements 
if the local subsidiaries contractual breach of pertinent sections of their contract were to occur  its liability for damages 
table of contents upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt  which is presently not estimable 
with respect to its international businesses  covanta has issued guarantees of certain of cpih s operating subsidiaries contractual obligations to operate power projects 
the potential damages owed under such arrangements for international projects may be material 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such domestic and international damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than covanta s then available sources of funds 
to date  covanta has not incurred material liabilities under its guarantees  either on domestic or international projects 
the company has investments in several investees and joint ventures which are accounted for under the equity and cost methods and therefore does not consolidate the financial information of those companies 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these leases 
contract structures and duration covanta attempts to structure contracts related to its domestic waste to energy projects as fixed price operating contracts which escalate in accordance with indices covanta believes appropriate to reflect price inflation  so that its revenue is relatively stable for the contract term 
covanta s returns will be similarly stable if it does not incur material unexpected operation and maintenance or other expense 
in addition  most of covanta s waste to energy project contracts are structured so that contract counterparties generally bear the costs associated with events or circumstances not within covanta s control  such as uninsured force majeure events and changes in legal requirements 
the stability of covanta s domestic revenue and returns could be affected by its ability to continue to enforce these obligations 
also  at some of covanta s waste to energy facilities  commodity price risk is further mitigated by passing through commodity costs to contract counterparties 
with respect to its domestic and international independent power projects  such structural features generally do not exist because either covanta operates and maintains such facilities for its own account or does so on a cost plus rather than a fixed fee basis 
certain energy contracts related to domestic projects provide for energy sales prices linked to the avoided costs of producing such energy and  therefore  energy revenues fluctuate with various economic factors 
in most of covanta s waste to energy projects  the operating subsidiary retains only a fraction of the energy revenues generally with the balance used to provide a credit to the client community against its disposal costs 
therefore  the client community derives most of the benefit and risk of changing energy prices 
one of covanta s waste to energy facilities sells electricity to the regional electricity grid without a contract and is therefore subject to energy market price fluctuation 
at some of covanta s domestic and international independent power projects  covanta s operating subsidiary purchases fuel in the open markets 
covanta is exposed to fuel price risk at these projects 
at other plants  fuel costs are contractually included in covanta s electricity revenues  or fuel is provided by covanta s customers 
in some of covanta s international projects  the project entity which in some cases is not a subsidiary of covanta has entered into long term fuel purchase contracts that protect the project from changes in fuel prices  provided counterparties to such contracts perform their commitments 
covanta s service agreements for domestic waste to energy projects begin to expire in  and energy sales contracts at covanta owned waste to energy projects generally expire at or after the date on which that project s service agreement expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject covanta to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its service agreements at municipally owned projects expire  covanta will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
as its service agreements at facilities it owns begin to expire  covanta intends to seek replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  covanta believes it will be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and 
table of contents provide acceptable revenues 
covanta will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
at covanta s domestic facilities  the expiration of existing energy sales contracts will require covanta to sell project energy output either into the electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that covanta will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to covanta 
covanta s opportunities for growth by investing in new domestic projects will be limited by existing debt covenants  as well as by competition from other companies in the waste disposal business 
because its business is based upon building and operating municipal solid waste processing and energy generating projects  which are capital intensive businesses  in order to provide meaningful growth covanta must be able to invest its own funds  obtain debt financing  and provide support to its operating subsidiaries 
when covanta was acquired by danielson and emerged from its bankruptcy proceeding in march  it entered into financing arrangements with restrictive covenants typical of work out financings 
these covenants essentially prohibit investments in new projects or acquisitions of new businesses  and place restrictions on covanta s ability to expand existing projects 
the covenants also prohibit borrowings to finance new construction  except in limited circumstances related to specifically identified expansions of existing facilities 
in addition  the covenants limit spending for new business development and require that excess cash flow be trapped to collateralize outstanding letters of credit 
covanta intends to pursue opportunities to expand the processing capacity where client communities have encountered significantly increased waste volumes without corresponding competitively priced landfill availability 
other than expansions at existing waste to energy projects  covanta does not expect to engage in material development activity which will require significant equity investment 
there can be no assurance that covanta will be able to implement expansions at existing facilities 
domestic covanta waste to energy project ownership structures covanta s waste to energy business originally was developed in response to competitive procurements conducted by municipalities for waste disposal services 
one of the threshold decisions made by each municipality early in the procurement process was whether it  or the winning vendor  would own the facility to be constructed  there were advantages and disadvantages to the municipality with both ownership structures 
as a result  domestic covanta today operates many publicly owned facilities  and owns and operates many others 
in addition  as a result of acquisitions of additional projects originally owned or operated by another vendor  domestic covanta operates several projects under a lease structure where a third party lessor owns the project 
in all cases  domestic covanta operates each facility pursuant to a long term contract  and provides the same service in consideration of a monthly service fee paid by the municipal client 
under both ownership structures  the municipalities typically borrowed funds to pay for the facility construction by issuing bonds 
in a private ownership structure  the municipal entity loans the bond proceeds to domestic covanta s project subsidiary  and the facility is recorded as an asset  and the project debt is recorded as a liability  on covanta s consolidated balance sheet 
in a public ownership structure  the municipality would pay for construction without loaning the bond proceeds to domestic covanta 
regardless of whether a project was owned by domestic covanta or its municipal client  the municipality is generally responsible for repaying the project debt after construction is complete 
where it owns the facility  the municipality pays periodic debt service directly to a trustee under an indenture 
for most projects where domestic covanta owns the facility  the municipal client pays debt service as a component of its monthly service fee payment to domestic covanta 
as of december   the principal amount of project debt outstanding with respect to these projects was approximately million 
as with a public ownership structure  this debt service payment is retained by a trustee  and is not held or available to covanta for general use 
in these private ownership structures  covanta records on its consolidated financial statements revenue with respect to debt service both principal and interest on project debt  and expense for depreciation and interest on project debt 

table of contents domestic covanta also owns two waste to energy projects for which debt service is not expressly included in the fee it is paid 
rather  domestic covanta receives a fee for each ton of waste processed at these projects 
as of december   the principal amount of project debt outstanding with respect to these projects was approximately million 
accordingly  domestic covanta does not record revenue reflecting principal on this project debt 
its operating subsidiaries for these projects make equal monthly deposits with their respective project trustees in amounts sufficient for the trustees to pay principal and interest when due 
for domestic covanta owned projects  all cash held by trustees is recorded as restricted funds held in trust 
for facilities not owned by domestic covanta  covanta does not incur  nor does it record project debt service obligations  project debt service revenue or project debt service expense 
domestic covanta generates electricity and or steam for sale at all of its waste to energy projects  regardless of ownership structure 
during the term of its operating contracts with its municipal clients  most of the revenue from electricity and steam sales typically benefits the municipal client as a reduction to its monthly service fee obligation to covanta 
generally  the term of domestic covanta s operating contracts with its municipal clients coincides with the term of the bonds issued to pay for the project construction 
therefore  another important difference between public and private ownership of domestic covanta s waste to energy projects is project ownership after these contracts expire 
in many cases  the municipality has contractual rights not obligations to extend the contract 
if a contract is not extended on a publicly owned project  domestic covanta s role  and its revenue  with respect to that project would cease 
if a contract is not extended on a domestic covanta owned project  it would be free to enter into new revenue generating contracts for waste supply with the municipality  other municipalities  or private waste haulers and for electricity or steam sales 
domestic covanta would in such cases have no remaining project debt to repay from project revenue  and would be entitled to retain of energy sales revenue

effective july  the decision was made to focus exclusively on the california non standard personal automobile insurance market 
effective july   naicc ceased writing new policy applications for commercial automobile insurance and began the process of providing the required statutory notice of its intention not to renew existing policies 
as of december   there were not any commercial automobile policies in force versus policies equivalent to in unearned premiums as of december  results of operations vs 
insurance operating results net earned premiums were million and million for the years ended and the change in earned premiums was a direct result of insurance services exiting the commercial automobile market in net written premiums were million for consisting entirely of non standard personal automobile policies 
net investment income was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the fixed income portfolio basis as well as a reduction in the portfolio yield 
fixed income invested assets portfolio decreased by only million in despite net loss and loss adjustment expenses lae reserves declining by million 
the differential was a result of management reducing its cash and short term investment positions 
due to the decrease in written premiums on business placed in run off noted above  naicc also experienced negative underwriting cash flows 
for the years ended and  the weighted average yield on the bond portfolio was and  respectively 
of the million change in investment income  million was the result of amortization recognized on a single bond that was called prior to its maturity date 
the effective duration of the portfolio at december  was years which management believed was appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all other lines of business 

table of contents net realized investment gains of million were recognized in compared to million in the difference in activity is attributed to management engaging new investment advisors in june to rebalance the portfolio to address extension  credit and reinvestment risk exposures 
concurrently  interest rates were at year lows and the stock market rebounded significantly in providing for more robust gains 
for  interest rates remained relatively low providing for some gain activity  but the portfolio provided better matching of principal pay down to claim settlements thus not requiring the same level of disposition activity 
the net loss and lae ratios were in and in the decrease in the loss and lae ratio during was attributable to much more stable development activity on prior accident years 
although commercial automobile  assumed property and casualty  and valor workers compensation reserves continued to generate unfavorable claim activity  the non standard personal automobile and california workers compensation performed better than anticipated 
the non standard personal automobile loss and allocated lae alae ratio were for accident year versus for accident year recorded in the accident year loss and alae ratio reduced to by year end 
non standard personal automobile claim frequency was and per vehicle months for accident years and  respectively 
claim severity trended favorably for non standard decreasing by from the prior year 
meanwhile average premium per vehicle on the non standard personal automobile remained constant  despite the mix of business moving towards non owner policies in versus in historically non owner policies yield loss and alae ratios to lower than owner policies 
workers compensation reforms were enacted in california in late and again in april the effects of the reforms were designed to curb medical cost spending and appear to have resulted in more favorable settlement activity 
although the reforms did not eliminate systemic abuse  they do appear to have modified the behavior of claimants  providers  and applicant attorneys 
although the impact of the reforms can not be measured  management was able to recognize favorable development in the amount of million 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net earned premiums were in and in policy acquisition costs include expenses which are directly related to premium volume ie  commissions  premium taxes and state assessments as well as certain underwriting expenses which vary with and are directly related to policy issuance 
the increase was a result of profit commissions earned by the general agent responsible for the marketing  underwriting and policy administration of the non standard personal automobile program 
the recognition of the profit commission was a direct result of favorable reserve development recognized on accident year and slightly improved results for accident year general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in in  management recognized additional pension expense of million related to participants electing to receive lump sum distributions of the pension plan and severance costs of million related to the outsourcing of its workers compensation claims 
in additional allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable of million and million in employee severance expenses related to business contraction inflated normal expenses 
normalizing both years for items noted  general and administrative costs expenses reduced by million 
management continues to examine its expense structure  however  given the decreases in premium production and its obligation to run off several lines of business  a core amount of fixed governance costs is required and consequently its expense ratio will run higher than industry averages until it can increase premium production 
results of operations vs 
insurance operating results net earned premiums were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the change in net earned premiums during was directly related to the change in net written premiums 
net written premiums were million and million in and  respectively 
net earned premiums exceeded net written premiums in due to a significant reduction in naicc s 
table of contents commercial automobile line and the decision made in to exit both the workers compensation line of business in all states and private passenger automobile outside of california 
workers compensation net written premiums decreased million during over the comparable period in the commercial automobile net written premiums decreased from million in to million in due to the decision to exit the line in july net written premiums for personal automobile lines decreased by million during primarily due to underwriting restrictions placed on the non standard california private passenger automobile program and the decline in net written premiums outside of california 
net investment income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the fixed income portfolio basis as well as a reduction in the portfolio yield 
fixed income invested asset portfolio decreased by million in  despite net loss and lae reserves declining by million 
the differential was a result of naicc disposing of substantially all of its equity security holdings in the fourth quarter of and reinvesting those proceeds  approximately million  in fixed income securities 
additionally  naicc received million in additional paid in capital from danielson at year end 
due to the decrease in written premiums on business placed in run off noted above  naicc also experienced negative underwriting cash flows 
as of december  and  the weighted average yield on naicc s portfolio was and  respectively 
the effective duration of the portfolio at december  was years which management believed was appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all lines of business 
in  naicc recognized million in gains from fixed income securities that were maturing in as a consequence of a dynamic interest rate environment throughout the year 
in  a realized investment gain of million was recognized upon conversion of the acl notes into equity 
this gain was offset by a million loss on non affiliated equity securities and a million gain on fixed maturities 
of the million loss on equity securities  million was recorded for other than temporary declines in fair value 
naicc had a net unrealized loss of million on its equity portfolio at the end of december and a modest net unrealized gain at december  net losses and lae ratios were in and in the increase in the loss and lae ratio during was attributable to further recognition of prior accident year reserve development on workers compensation and commercial automobile insurance 
naicc has historically priced its non standard private passenger and commercial auto premium at to of its expected loss and alae costs in order to balance its expense structure and market conditions 
in  naicc believed it had a far more successful underwriting year  posting loss and alae ratios of and for its california non standard auto and entire commercial auto program 
these results were commensurate with industry results for driven primarily by the hard insurance market 
non standard private passenger and commercial auto claim frequency was and per  vehicle months in accident year compared to and per  vehicle months in  respectively 
severity was favorable for both lines as well in compared to by reduction of average cost per claim of three percent and six percent for the personal and commercial auto lines  respectively 
although both these indicators were favorable in  the average premium per vehicle on commercial lines had the most significant effect on the loss and alae ratio 
the average premium per vehicle on commercial lines increased for the accident year 
with respect to the personal automobile insurance  the mix of business moving towards non owner policies in versus in had the most significant impact for this program s improved loss and lae ratio 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net earned premiums were in and in the modest decrease was a result of change in the mix of business and a favorable renegotiation by management of its commission structure with its general agent in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses increased in over levels by million primarily due to recording an additional allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable of million and million in employee severance expenses related to business contraction 
exclusive of the two items noted above  expenses decreased million compared to due to decreased production and previously implemented cost containment efforts 

table of contents cash flow from insurance operations cash used in operations was million  million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the ongoing use of cash in operations was due to insurance services continuing to make payments related to discontinued lines and territories in excess of premium receipts from the non standard personal automobile 
this negative cash flow restricted insurance services from fully re investing bond maturity proceeds and in some circumstances required the sale of bonds in order to meet obligations as they arose 
cash provided from investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with million and million for the comparable period in and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by investing activities compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of larger cash balances held at year end 
there was no cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  and compared to the million for resulted from a million capital contribution by danielson and the early repayment of a million promissory note in liquidity and capital resources of insurance operations insurance services requires both readily liquid assets and adequate capital to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and claimants  as well as to pay ordinary operating expenses 
insurance services meets both its short term and long term liquidity requirements through operating cash flows that include premium receipts  investment income and reinsurance recoveries 
to the extent operating cash flows do not provide sufficient cash flow  insurance services relies on the sale of invested assets 
insurance services investment policy guidelines require that all loss and lae liabilities be matched by a comparable amount of investment grade assets 
danielson believes that insurance services currently has both adequate capital resources and sufficient reinsurance to meet its current operating requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners provides minimum solvency standards in the form of risk based capital requirements rbc 
the rbc model for property and casualty insurance companies requires that carriers report their rbc ratios based on their statutory annual statements as filed with the regulatory authorities 
insurance services consolidated rbc is in excess of company action level 
two other common measures of capital adequacy for insurance companies are premium to surplus ratios which measure current operating risk and reserves to surplus ratios which measure financial risk related to possible changes in the level of loss and lae reserves 
a commonly accepted standard for net written premium to surplus ratio is to  although this varies with different lines of business 
insurance services annualized premium to year end statutory surplus ratio of to remains well under current industry standards 
insurance services ratio of loss and lae reserves to statutory surplus of to at december  was within industry guidelines 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses insurance services estimates reserves for unpaid losses and lae based on reported losses and historical experience  including losses reported by other insurance companies for reinsurance assumed  and estimates of expenses for investigating and adjusting all incurred and unadjusted claims 
key assumptions used in the estimation process could have significant effects on the reserve balances 
insurance services regularly evaluates their estimates and assumptions based on historical experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends 
changes in the unpaid losses and lae can materially effect the statement of operations 
different estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period based on the economic conditions 
since the loss reserving process is complex and subjective  the ultimate liability may vary significantly from our estimates

discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  danielson is required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of danielson s critical accounting policies are those subject to significant judgments and uncertainties which could potentially result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
purchase accounting danielson applied purchase accounting in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations  for its acquisition of covanta 
as described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  danielson valued the acquired assets and liabilities assumed at fair value 
the estimates of fair value used by danielson reflect its best estimate based on the work of danielson and independent valuation consultants and  where such work has not been completed  such estimates have been based on danielson s experience and relevant information available to management 
these estimates  and the assumptions used by danielson and by its valuation consultants  are subject to inherent uncertainties and contingencies beyond danielson s control 
for example  danielson used the discounted cash flow method to estimate value of many of its assets 
this entails developing projections about future cash flows and adopting an appropriate discount rate 
danielson can not predict with certainty actual cash flows and the selection of a discount rate is heavily 
table of contents dependent on judgment 
if different cash flow projections or discount rates were used  the fair values of danielson s assets and liabilities could be materially increased or decreased 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions reflected in the valuations will be realized  or that further adjustments will not occur 
the assumptions and estimates used by danielson therefore have substantial effect on danielson s balance sheet 
in addition because the valuations impact depreciation and amortization  changes in such assumptions and estimates may effect earnings in the future 
long lived assets danielson has estimated the useful lives over which it depreciates its long lived assets 
such estimates are based on danielson s experience and management s expectations as to the useful lives of the various categories of assets it owns  as well as practices in industries danielson believes are comparable 
estimates of useful lives determine the rate at which danielson depreciates such assets and utilizing other estimates could impact both danielson s balance sheet and earnings statements 
danielson reviews its long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable over the estimated useful life 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including which cash flows are directly attributable to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which the cash flows will occur  their amount and the assets residual value  if any 
also  impairment losses require an estimate of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
danielson principally uses internal discounted cash flow estimates  but also uses quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and internal business plans with an appropriate discount rate applied 
accordingly  inaccuracies in the assumptions used by management in establishing these estimates  and in the assumptions used in establishing the extent to which a particular asset may be impaired  could potentially have a material effect on danielson s consolidated financial statements 
net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets as described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  danielson has recorded a deferred tax asset related to the nols 
the amount recorded was calculated based upon future taxable income arising from a the reversal of temporary differences during the period the nols are available and b future operating income expected from covanta s domestic business  to the extent it is reasonably predictable 
danielson cannot be certain that the nols will be available to offset the tax liability of danielson 
cpih and its subsidiaries and covanta lake will not be consolidated with the balance of danielson for federal income tax purposes 
if the nols were not available to offset the tax liability of covanta other than cpih and covanta lake  covanta does not expect to have sufficient cash flow available to pay debt service on the domestic facilities described above under liquidity cash flow 
danielson estimated that it had nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes as of the end of the nols will expire in various amounts beginning on december  through december   if not used 
the amount of nols available to covanta will be reduced by any taxable income generated by current members of danielson s tax consolidated group including certain grantor trust relating to the mission insurance entities 
the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of danielson s tax returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported  and it could challenge any past and future use of the nols 
under applicable tax law  the use and availability of danielson s nols could be limited if there is a more than increase in stock ownership during a year testing period by stockholders owning or more of danielson s stock 
danielson s certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions that were designed to help preserve danielson s nols by avoiding such an ownership change 
danielson expects that 
table of contents the restrictions will remain in force as long as danielson has nols 
there can be no assurance  however  that these restrictions will prevent such an ownership change 
loss contingencies as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  danielson s subsidiaries are party to a number of claims  lawsuits and pending actions  most of which are routine and all of which are incidental to its business 
danielson assesses the likelihood of potential losses with respect to these matters on an ongoing basis and when losses are considered probable and reasonably estimable  records as a loss an estimate of the ultimate outcome 
if danielson can only estimate the range of a possible loss  an amount representing the low end of the range of possible outcomes is recorded and disclosure is made regarding the possibility of additional losses 
danielson reviews such estimates on an ongoing basis as developments occur with respect to such matters and may in the future increase or decrease such estimates 
there can be no assurance that danielson s initial or adjusted estimates of losses will reflect the ultimate loss danielson may experience regarding such matters 
any inaccuracies could potentially have a material effect on danielson s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition covanta s revenues are generally earned under contractual arrangements and fall into three categories service revenues  electricity and steam revenues  and construction revenues 
service revenues consist of the following fees earned under contract to operate and maintain waste to energy  independent power and water facilities are recognized as revenue when earned  regardless of the period they are billed  fees earned to service project debt principal and interest where such fees are expressly included as a component of the service fee paid by the client community pursuant to applicable waste to energy service agreements 
regardless of the timing of amounts paid by client communities relating to project debt principal  covanta records service revenue with respect to this principal component on a levelized basis over the term of the service agreement 
unbilled service receivables related to waste to energy operations are discounted in recognizing the present value for services performed currently in order to service the principal component of the project debt 
such unbilled receivables amounted to million at december   fees earned for processing waste in excess of service agreement requirements are recognized as revenue beginning in the period covanta processes waste in excess of the contractually stated requirements  tipping fees earned under waste disposal agreements are recognized as revenue in the period waste is received  and other miscellaneous fees such as revenue for scrap metal recovered and sold are generally recognized as revenue when scrap metal is sold 
electricity and steam sales revenue from the sale of electricity and steam are earned at energy facilities and are recorded based upon output delivered and capacity provided at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates net of amounts due to client communities under applicable service agreements 
construction revenues revenues under fixed price construction contracts  including construction  are recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion of services rendered 
construction revenues also include design  engineering and construction management fees 
in  covanta incurred some preliminary construction costs for which it has not billed the municipality or received reimbursement covanta anticipates the contracts will be finalized in at which time it expects to be fully reimbursed for such costs 

table of contents unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses insurance services establishes loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
reserves are typically comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  which include a provision for expected future development on case reserves 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim and are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid loss and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate loss and lae 
actuaries estimate ultimate loss and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ultimate loss and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate loss and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
insurance service s own experience  particularly claims development experience  such as trends in case reserves  payments on and closings of claims  as well as changes in business mix and coverage limits  are the most important information for estimating its reserves 
uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually a few days up to a few months 
the claim tail for automobile liability is relatively short usually one to two years and liability casualty coverages  such as general liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  insurance services may adjust its reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is booked in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  should reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
insurance services uses independent actuaries which it significantly relies on to form a conclusion on reserve estimates 
those independent actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate insurance services loss reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
the independent actuaries place more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made and through discussions with insurance services management 
insurance services reserves include provisions made for claims that assert damages from asbestos and environmental a e related exposures against policies issued prior to asbestos claims relate primarily to injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up cost obligations  particularly as mandated by federal and state environmental protection agencies 
in addition to the factors described above regarding the reserving process  insurance services estimates its a e reserves based upon  among other factors  facts surrounding reported cases and exposures to claims  such as policy limits  existence of other underlying primary coverage and deductibles  current law  past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  as well as analysis of industry studies and events  such as recent settlements and asbestos related bankruptcies 
the cost of administering a e claims  which is an important factor in estimating loss reserves  tends to be higher than in the case of non a e claims due to the higher legal costs typically associated with a e claims 
due to the inherent difficulties in estimating ultimate a e 
table of contents exposures  insurance services and its contracted independent actuaries do not estimate a range for a e incurred losses 
due to the factors discussed above and others  the process used in estimating unpaid losses on lae cannot provide an exact result 
danielson s results of operation for each of the past three years have been adversely affected by insurance loss development related to prior years of million  million and million for  and respectively 
the prior year development recognized in  and  expressed as a percentage of the previous years reported loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoveries  was  and  respectively 
the lines of business significantly contributing to the adverse development include workers compensation  commercial automobile and property and casualty 
workers compensation was most affected by changes in california legislation that occurred in and took several years to develop  with such development being different than the experience prior to in and new california legislative reforms have taken hold that appear to be reversing some of the prior recognized adverse development 
commercial automobile was most significantly impacted by case strengthening related to a change in claims administration in  coupled with the recognition that development factors of prior years were not as indicative of the business written for those respective years due to changes in risk profile and limits 
due to stabilization of claims staff and recognition of the profile change that occurred in  the adjustments recorded to commercial automobile in and are likely to hold 
given the nature of the casualty line of business  most notably the a e liabilities  it is difficult to assess whether the extent of adverse adjustments recognized in the past will be required in future periods 
the table below shows insurance services recorded loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoveries  as of december  by line of business compared to the high and low ends of the reserve range that our contracted actuaries have determined to be acceptable for issuing their opinions 
given the nature and extent of long tail liabilities versus total net reserves and the fact that net reserves have historically shown adverse development  insurance services can not provide assurances that its estimate of loss and lae reserves will not adversely develop outside of the individual line of business ranges and in such instances could materially effect the statement of operations 
however as insurance services is limited in its current policy writing to the non standard personal automobile program  the extent of adverse development recognized in the past will likely not re occur 
in thousands of dollars 
range of reserves by line of business low reported high on going lines of business private passenger automobile scj programs discontinued lines of business private passenger automobile non scj programs commercial automobile workers compensation property and casualty non a e property and casualty a e net unpaid losses and lae at end of year the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by line of business is higher for each line of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all lines taken together due to the effects of diversification 
moreover  it would not be appropriate to add the ranges for each line of business to obtain a range around the total net reserves as each line of business is not completely correlated 
although management believes the reserves are reasonably stated  ultimate losses may deviate  perhaps materially  from the recorded reserve amounts and could be above the high end of the range of actuarial projections

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
danielson is required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  danielson must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
danielson is evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expects that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on danielson s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
danielson has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and it has not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of additional accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements

this second lien credit facility has a term of five years 
the letter of credit component of the second lien credit facility requires cash collateral to be posted for issued letters of credit in the event covanta has cash in excess of specified amounts 
covanta also paid an upfront fee of million upon entering into the second lien credit agreement  and will pay a commitment fee equal to per annum of the daily calculation of available credit  an annual agency fee of  and with respect to each issued letter of credit an amount equal to per annum of the daily amount available to be drawn under such letter of credit 
amounts paid with respect to drawn letters of credit bear interest at the rate of over the base rate on issued letters of credit  increasing to over the base rate in specified default situations 
subsequent to the signing of the investment and purchase agreement  each of the bridge lenders assigned approximately of their participation in the second lien letter of credit facility to goldman sachs credit partners  lp and laminar assigned the remainder of its participation in the second lien letter of credit facility to trs elara  llc 
danielson obtained the financing for its acquisition of covanta pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated december   from the bridge lenders 
pursuant to the note purchase agreement  the bridge lenders provided danielson with million of bridge financing in exchange for notes issued by danielson 
danielson repaid the notes with the proceeds from a rights offering of common stock of danielson which was completed in june and in connection with the conversion of a portion of the note held by laminar into million shares of common stock of danielson pursuant to the note purchase agreement 
in consideration for the million of bridge financing and the arrangement by the bridge lenders of the million second lien credit facility and the arrangement by laminar of a million international revolving credit facility secured by covanta s international assets  danielson issued to the bridge lenders an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
pursuant to registration rights agreements danielson filed a registration statement with the sec to register the shares of common stock issued to the bridge lenders under the note purchase agreement 
the registration statement was declared effective on august  as part of danielson s negotiations with laminar and it becoming a five percent stockholder  pursuant to a letter agreement dated december   laminar agreed to transfer restrictions on the shares of common stock that laminar acquired pursuant to the note purchase agreement 
further  in accordance with the transfer restrictions contained in article five of danielson s charter restricting the resale of danielson s common stock by five percent stockholders  danielson has agreed with laminar to provide it with limited rights to resell the common stock that it holds 
also in connection with the financing for the acquisition of covanta  danielson agreed to pay up to million in the aggregate to the bridge lenders as reimbursement for expenses incurred by them in connection with the note purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement and other transactions involving sz investments  tavf and laminar were negotiated  reviewed and approved by a special committee of danielson s board of directors composed solely of disinterested directors and advised by independent legal and financial advisors 
as of january   danielson entered into a stock purchase agreement with ref fuel  an owner and operator of waste to energy facilities in the northeast united states  and ref fuel s stockholders to purchase of the issued and outstanding shares of ref fuel capital stock 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the company will pay million in cash for the stock of ref fuel and will assume the consolidated net debt of ref fuel  which as of september  was billion  resulting in an 
table of contents enterprise value of approximately billion for ref fuel 
after the transaction is completed  ref fuel will be a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta 
danielson intends to finance its anticipated purchase of ref fuel through a combination of debt and equity financing 
the equity component of the financing is expected to consist of an approximately million offering of warrants or other rights to purchase danielson s common stock to all of danielson s existing stockholders at per share 
in this ref fuel rights offering danielson s existing stockholders will be issued rights to purchase danielson s stock on a pro rata basis  with each holder entitled to purchase approximately shares of danielson s common stock at an exercise price of per full share for each share of danielson s common stock then held 
sz investments and its affiliate and egi fund investors  llc  tavf and laminar representing ownership of approximately of danielson s outstanding common stock  have each separately committed to participate in the ref fuel rights offering and acquire their respective pro rata portion of the shares 
as consideration for their commitments  danielson will pay each of these four stockholders an amount equal to to of their respective equity commitments  depending on the timing of the transaction 
danielson agreed to amend an existing registration rights agreement to provide these stockholders with the right to demand that danielson undertake an underwritten offering within twelve months of the closing of the acquisition of ref fuel in order to provide such stockholders with liquidity 
danielson also expects to complete its previously announced rights offering for up to three million shares of its common stock to certain holders of debentures issued by covanta at a purchase price of per share which danielson is required to conduct in order to satisfy its obligations as the sponsor of the plan of reorganization of covanta 
the offering will be made solely to holders of the million of principal amount of debentures due issued by covanta that voted in favor of covanta s second reorganization plan on january  on january   holders of million in principal amount of debentures voted in favor of the plan of reorganization and are eligible to participate in the offering 
danielson has executed a letter agreement with laminar pursuant to which danielson agrees that if the offering has not closed prior to the record date for the ref fuel rights offering  then danielson will revise the offering so that the holders that participate in the offering are offered additional shares of danielson s common stock at the same purchase price as in the ref fuel rights offering and in an amount equal to the number of shares of common stock that such holders would have been entitled to purchase in the rights offering if the offering was consummated on or prior to the record date for the ref fuel rights offering 
danielson has filed a registration statement with respect to the offering and intends to file a registration statement with respect to the ref fuel rights offering with the sec and the statements contained herein shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy shares of danielson s common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  danielson s subsidiaries are party to financial instruments that are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
danielson s use of derivative instruments is very limited and it does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding danielson s exposure to financial instruments with market risks 
danielson uses a sensitivity model to evaluate the 
table of contents fair value or cash flows of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel manner and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  further information is included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
energy business interest rate risk covanta and or its subsidiaries have project debt outstanding bearing interest at floating rates that could subject it to the risk of increased interest expense due to rising market interest rates  or an adverse change in fair value due to declining interest rates on fixed rate debt 
of covanta s project debt  approximately million was floating rate at december  however  of that floating rate project debt  million related to waste to energy projects where  because of their contractual structure  interest rate risk is borne by client communities because debt service is passed through to those clients 
covanta had only one interest rate swap outstanding at december  in the notional amount of million related to floating rate project debt 
gains and losses on this swap are for the account of the client community 
for floating rate debt  a percent hypothetical increase in the underlying december  market interest rates would result in a potential loss to twelve month future earnings of million 
for fixed rate debt  the potential reduction in fair value from a percent hypothetical increase in the underlying december  market interest rates would be approximately million 
the fair value of the covanta s fixed rate debt including million in fixed rate debt related to revenue bonds in which debt service is an explicit component of the service fees billed to the client communities was million at december   and was determined using average market quotations of price and yields provided by investment banks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk covanta has investments in energy projects in various foreign countries  including the philippines  china  india and bangladesh  and to a much lesser degree  italy and costa rica 
neither danielson nor covanta enters into currency transactions to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
instead  covanta attempts to mitigate its currency risks by structuring its project contracts so that its revenues and fuel costs are denominated in the same currency 
as a result  the us dollar is the functional currency at most of covanta s international projects 
therefore  only local operating expenses and project debt denominated in other than a project entity s functional currency are exposed to currency risks 
at december   covanta had million of project debt related to two diesel engine projects in india 
for million of the debt related to project entities whose functional currency is the indian rupee  exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as translation adjustments to the cumulative translation adjustment account within stockholders deficit in danielson s consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining million of debt is denominated in us dollars 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a adverse change in december  quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
under cpih s current financing arrangements  these risks are borne primarily by the cpih borrowers to the extent they affect the cash flow available to the cpih borrowers to repay cpih indebtedness 
these risks will continue to affect items reflected on danielson s consolidated financial statements 
at december   covanta also had net investments in foreign subsidiaries and projects

alternatively  covanta attempts to mitigate the risk of energy and fuel market fluctuations by structuring contracts related to its energy projects in the manner described above under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contract structures and duration 
generally  covanta is protected against fluctuations in the waste disposal market  and thus its ability to charge acceptable fees for its services  through service agreements existing long term disposal contracts at its waste to energy facilities 
at three of its waste to energy facilities  differing amounts of waste disposal capacity are not subject to long term contracts and  therefore  covanta is partially exposed to the risk of market fluctuations in the waste disposal fees it may charge 
covanta s service agreements begin to expire in  and energy sales contracts at company owned projects generally expire at or after the date on which that project s service agreement expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject covanta to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its service agreements at municipally owned projects expire  covanta will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
as covanta s service agreements at facilities it owns begin to expire  covanta intends to seek replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  covanta expects to be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and provide acceptable revenues 
covanta will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
at company owned facilities  the expiration of existing energy sales contracts will require covanta to sell its output either into the local electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that covanta will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to covanta 
covanta s opportunities for growth by investing in new projects will be limited by existing debt covenants  as well as by competition from other companies in the waste disposal business 
because its business is based upon building and operating municipal solid waste processing and energy generating projects  which are capital intensive businesses  in order to provide meaningful growth covanta must be able to invest its own funds  obtain debt financing and provide support to its operating subsidiaries 
when covanta was acquired by danielson and emerged from its bankruptcy proceeding in march  it entered into financing arrangements with restrictive covenants typical of financings of companies emerging from bankruptcy 
these covenants essentially prohibit investments in new projects or acquisitions of new businesses  and place restrictions on covanta s ability to expand existing projects 
the covenants also prohibit borrowings to finance new construction  except in limited circumstances related to specifically identified expansions of existing facilities 
in addition  the covenants limit spending for new business development and require that excess cash flow be trapped to collateralize outstanding letters of credit 
covanta intends to pursue opportunities to expand the processing capacity where municipal clients have encountered significantly increased waste volumes without corresponding competitively priced landfill availability 
other than expansions at existing waste to energy projects  covanta does not expect to engage in material development activity which will require significant equity investment 
there can be no assurance that covanta will be able to implement expansions at existing facilities 
insurance services risk related to the investment portfolio naicc s objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and investment returns while minimizing overall market risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including duration of liabilities  underwriting results  overall tax position  regulatory requirements  and fluctuations in interest rates 
investment decisions are made by management  in consultation with an independent investment advisor  and approved by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of securities 
the market risks related to naicc s fixed 
table of contents maturity portfolio are primarily credit risk  interest rate risk  reinvestment risk and prepayment risk 
the market risk related to naicc s equity portfolio is price risk 
fixed maturities interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in interest rate 
management views these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability matching 
management estimates the payout patterns of naicc s liabilities  primarily loss reserves  to determine their duration 
management sets duration targets for the fixed income portfolio after consideration of the duration of naicc s liabilities that it believes mitigates the overall interest rate risk 
naicc s exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of its insurance and other liabilities 
the effective duration of the portfolio at december  and was years and years  respectively 
management believes its portfolio duration is appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all other lines of business 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would cause an approximate decrease in the fair value of the portfolio while a hypothetical basis point decrease would cause an approximate increase in fair value 
credit risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in the credit quality of such investment 
naicc s exposure to credit risk is mitigated by its investment in high quality fixed income alternatives 
fixed maturities of naicc include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  collectively mbs representing and of total fixed maturities at december  and december   respectively 
all mbs held by naicc are issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  which are both rated aaa by moody s investors services 
both fnma and fhlmc are corporations that were created by acts of congress 
fnma and fhlmc guarantee the principal balance of their securities 
fnma guarantees timely payment of principal and interest 
one of the risks associated with mbs is the timing of principal payments on the mortgages underlying the securities 
the principal an investor receives depends upon amortization schedules and the termination pattern resulting from prepayments or defaults of the individual mortgages included in the underlying pool of mortgages 
the principal is guaranteed but the yield and cash flow can vary depending on the timing of the repayment of the principal balance 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to changes in yield is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity to repayment of the underlying mortgages backing the securities in a changing interest rate environment  and the repayment priority of the securities in its overall securitization structure 
naicc attempts to limit repayment risk by purchasing mbs whose cost is below or does not significantly exceed par  and by primarily purchasing structured securities with repayment protection which provides more certain cash flow to the investor such as mbs with sinking fund schedules known as planned amortization classes pac and targeted amortization classes tac 
the structures of pac s and tac s attempt to increase the certainty of the timing of prepayment and thereby minimize the prepayment and interest rate risk 
in  naicc recognized million in gain on sales of fixed maturities 
mbs  as well as callable bonds  have a greater sensitivity to market value declines in a rising interest rate environment than to market value increases in a declining interest rate environment 
this is primarily due to the ability and the incentive of the payor to prepay the principal or the issuer to call the bond in a declining interest rate scenario 
naicc realized significant increases in its prepayments of principal during and the prepayments mitigated the need to sell securities to meet operating cash requirements as noted previously 
generally  this trend will lower the portfolio yield in future years in a declining interest environment 
as interest rates at december  are at relatively historical lows  naicc is subject to reinvestment risk as approximately of its fixed maturity portfolio will be received in the following year 
absent changing its credit risk and extension profile  it is unlikely that naicc could reinvest proceeds at yields similar to those recognized in 
table of contents equity securities in the fourth quarter of  naicc sold nearly all of its equity investments capitalizing on the general stock market recovery and specifically the technology sector 
in  naicc recognized million as net realized gains from equity investments 
in third and fourth quarter of  naicc began reinvesting in equity securities  generally limited to fortune companies with strong balance sheets  history of dividend growth and price appreciation 
as of december  equity securities represented of the total naicc investment portfolio 
economic conditions the operating results of a property and casualty insurer are influenced by a variety of factors including general economic conditions  competition  regulation of insurance rates  weather  frequency and severity of losses 
the california non standard personal auto market in which naicc operates has experienced a recovery of rate adequacy coupled with stable competition 
frequency of claims improved from to and remained stable in  while the average cost of settling claims has steadily improved from to
