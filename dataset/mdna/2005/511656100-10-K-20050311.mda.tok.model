the company earned million for versus million for  an increase of 
the increase was driven by a million increase in noninterest income  an  decrease in the provision for loan losses and a  increase in net interest income

the lower provision in versus was attributable to a number of factors  but was primarily a result of the decrease in the level of charge offs from million in to  in the level of loan loss provision is also influenced by the overall growth in the loan portfolio and other factors related to this growth  such as emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss percentages 
in addition  management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
management s overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses 
the company s management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels  asset quality  economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans 
noninterest income was million in versus million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was driven by a million  or  decrease in gains on sale of mortgages  from million in to  in as mortgage originations decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
as experienced by the industry generally  this decrease was a result of the decreased level of mortgage activity during resulting from consumers having refinanced their homes in and when rates were falling 
additionally  noninterest income decreased due to a  decrease in gains on securities sold 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases of  or  in trust and brokerage fees and  or  in merchant card fee income 
the increase in trust and brokerage fees was driven by the company s december  acquisition of indiana capital management while the increase in merchant card fees was driven by higher volume activity in interchange and merchant fee income 
noninterest expense decreased million  or from million in to million in equipment expense decreased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense and personal property tax expenses 
depreciation expense was lower as a result of technology asset additions related to system upgrades driven by yk issues  these assets have now fully depreciated 
credit card interchange fees increased from million in to million in driven by higher processing costs charged by visa and increased credit card usage 
in addition  during  the company redeemed its existing high fixed rate subordinated debentures and reissued variable rate subordinated debentures at a lower rate to better match long term assets and liabilities 
the redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of  as a result of these factors  income before income tax expense increased million  or  from million in to million in income tax expense was million in versus million in income tax as a percentage of income before tax was in versus in the higher tax rate resulted from a decreased percentage of the company s income being derived from tax advantaged sources

interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the company s daily cost of funds over the year 
the company had a net interest margin of in versus in average earning assets increased by million and totaled billion in and the primary driver was a million increase in the average daily loan balance 
deposits increased to fund the loan growth during  driven primarily by increases of million in the average daily interest bearing checking account balances and increases of million in the average daily demand deposit balances 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the issuance of floating rate trust preferred securities and the redemption of its existing fixed rate trust preferred securities 
the interest rate on subordinated debentures  which are tied to the trust preferred securities  changed from a fixed rate to a variable rate of basis points over the month libor rate in the fourth quarter of nonaccrual loans were  or of total loans  at year end versus million  or of total loans  at the end of there were two relationships totaling million classified as impaired as of december  versus nine relationships totaling million at the end of one commercial credit represented million and million of this amount in and the renewal of this loan was complicated as more than one bank was involved  and it was past maturity  however at year end the loan was current as to principal and interest 
the loan first became delinquent in and the maturity was not extended 
the decrease was the result of payments on six commercial loans  including one loan of million 
net charge offs were million in versus million in  representing and of average daily loans in and total nonperforming loans were million  or of total loans  at year end versus million  or of total loans  at the end of the provision for loan loss expense was million in  resulting in an allowance for loan losses at december  of million  which represented of the loan portfolio  versus a provision for loan loss expense of million in and an allowance for loan losses of million in  or of the loan portfolio 
the lower provision in versus was attributable to a number of factors  but was primarily a result of the decrease in nonperforming loans during the continued challenging economic conditions during and the resulting impact on asset quality as evidenced by the percentage of internally classified loans in was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses 
the company s management continued to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels  asset quality  economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans 
noninterest income was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was driven by a million  or  increase in gains on sale of mortgages  from million in to million in this increase was a result of the increased level of mortgage activity during additionally  noninterest income increased due to a  reduction in the charge for non cash impairment of the company s mortgage servicing rights  a  increase in the earnings on life insurance  a  increase in gains on securities sold and a  increase in operating lease income 
the increase in earnings on life insurance occurred primarily due to the life insurance not being put into place until the fourth quarter of noninterest expense increased million  or from million in to million in salaries and wages increased million  or  to million in versus million in this increase was attributable to normal salary increases  increases related to the employee k plan  higher health care costs and staff additions 
net occupancy expense increased from million in to million in as a result of increased spending to refurbish several offices and higher real estate tax expense 
included in other expense was a  write down on an ore property  which was subsequently sold by year end 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the issuance of floating rate trust preferred securities and the redemption of its existing fixed rate trust preferred securities 
the redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of as a result of these factors  income before income tax expense increased million  or  from million in to million in income tax expense was million in versus million in income tax as a percentage of income before tax was in versus in the lower tax rate resulted from increased investment in tax advantaged securities and investments and an increase in the level of income derived from the investment subsidiary 
net income increased million  or  to million in versus million in basic earnings per share in was  an increase of  versus in the company s net income performance represented a return on january   stockholders equity versus in the net income performance resulted in a return on average daily assets in versus in financial condition as of december   the company had offices serving twelve counties in northern indiana 
the company added no new offices during since  the company has added seventeen new offices through acquisition and internal growth 
the company will consider future acquisition and expansion opportunities with an emphasis on markets that it believes would be receptive to its business philosophy of local  independent banking 
the company sold five branches in its south region during the third quarter of in order to help position the company to focus on growth opportunities in its core northern markets  which are anchored by the cities of warsaw  fort wayne  elkhart and south bend  indiana 
total assets of the company were billion as of december   an increase of million  or  when compared to billion as of december  total cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to funding needs associated with a corresponding increase in the company s deposits 
total securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was a result of a number of activities in the securities portfolio 
paydowns of million were received  and the amortization of premiums  net of the accretion of discounts  was million 
maturities  calls and sales of securities totaled million 
the fair value of the securities increased  as a result of a flattening of the yield curve during the second half of these portfolio decreases were offset by securities purchases totaling million 
the investment portfolio is managed to limit the company s exposure to risk and contains mostly collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities which are either directly or indirectly backed by the federal government or a local municipal government 
the investment portfolio did not contain any corporate debt instruments or trust preferred instruments as of december  real estate mortgages held for sale decreased by  or  to million at december  from million at december  the balance of this asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on  among other things  recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market 
during  million in real estate mortgages were originated for sale and million in mortgages were sold  compared to million and million in total loans  excluding real estate mortgages held for sale  increased by million or  to billion at december  from million at december  the mix of loan types within the company s portfolio extended a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans 
the portfolio breakdown at year end reflected commercial  real estate and consumer loans compared to commercial  real estate and consumer loans at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  versus million  or  of total loans outstanding at december  the process of identifying probable credit losses is a subjective process 
therefore  the company maintains a general allowance to cover probable incurred credit losses within the entire portfolio 
the methodology management uses to determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve includes the following considerations 
the company has a relatively high percentage of commercial and commercial real estate loans  most of which are extended to small or medium sized businesses 
commercial loans represent higher dollar loans to fewer customers and therefore higher credit risk 
pricing is adjusted to manage the higher credit risk associated with these types of loans 
the majority of fixed rate mortgage loans  which represent increased interest rate risk  are sold in the secondary market  as well as some variable rate mortgage loans 
the remainder of the variable rate mortgage loans and a small number of fixed rate mortgage loans are retained 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio 
however  as a result of the slow economic recovery  certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the uncollectability of the principal is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses relating to specifically identified loans based on an evaluation  as well as other probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon a monthly review of those credits 
an appropriate level of general allowance is determined after considering the following factors application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentrations  new industry lending activity and general economic conditions 
federal regulations require insured institutions to classify their own assets on a regular basis 
the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish specific allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  the company had loans totaling million on the classified loan list versus million on december  as of december   the company had million of assets classified special mention  million classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and classified as loss as compared to million  million   and at december  allowance estimates are developed by management in consultation with regulatory authorities  taking into account actual loss experience  adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the company s loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
in accordance with fasb statements and  the allowance is provided for losses that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date and is based on past events and current economic conditions  and does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
the company has experienced growth in total loans over the last three years of million  or 
the concentration of this loan growth was in the commercial loan portfolio 
commercial loans comprised  and of the total loan portfolio at december   and traditionally  this type of lending may have more credit risk than other types of lending because of the size and diversity of the credits 
the company manages this risk by adjusting its pricing to the perceived risk of each individual credit and by diversifying the portfolio by customer  product  industry and geography 
management believes that it is prudent to continue to provide for loan losses in a manner consistent with its historical approach due to loan growth described above and current economic conditions 
as a result of the methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in versus million in at december   total nonperforming loans increased by million to million from million at december  loans delinquent days or more that were included in the accompanying financial statements as accruing totaled million versus million at december  total impaired loans increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increases in nonperforming loans and impaired loans resulted primarily from the addition of a single commercial credit of million 
the borrower filed for chapter bankruptcy late in the third quarter of and is in the process of determining its future business strategy 
borrower collateral and the personal guarantees of its principals support the credit 
the total loans that are delinquent days or more include one commercial credit for million and million in and the renewal of this loan has been complicated as more than one bank is involved  and it remains past maturity 
the loan first became delinquent in and the maturity has not been extended 
while this loan is current as to principal and interest  there can be no assurance that it will remain current given the circumstances involved 
the impaired loan total includes million in nonaccrual loans 
the company allocated million and  of the allowance for loan losses to the impaired loans in and a loan is impaired when full payment under the original loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance may be allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the company does not believe that the increase in total nonperforming loans is indicative of a trend and that the overall decrease in classified loans is a better reflection of the continued focus on enforcement of a strong credit environment  an aggressive position on loan work out situations and a general improvement in the regional economic conditions 
the allowance for loan loss to total loans percentage decreased from in to in despite these factors  the company does not believe that it has experienced any meaningful change in overall asset quality 
the company believes that its overall expansion strategy has employed a credit risk management approach that promotes diversification and therefore creates a balanced portfolio with appropriate risk parameters 
total deposits increased by million  or  to billion at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from increases of million in certificates of deposit  million in demand deposit accounts  million in now accounts and million in savings accounts 
offsetting these increases were declines of million in investors money market accounts and million in money market accounts 
total short term borrowings increased by  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from a million increase in federal home loan bank advances combined with decreases of million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  million in federal fund purchases and  in us treasury demand notes 
the company believes that a strong  appropriately managed capital position is critical to long term earnings and expansion 
bank regulatory agencies exclude the market value adjustment created by sfas no 
afs adjustment from capital adequacy calculations 
excluding this adjustment from the calculation  the company had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier i risk based capital ratio of as of december  these ratios met or exceeded the federal reserve s well capitalized minimums of and  respectively 
the ability to maintain and grow these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors o cash dividends of million  o an unfavorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of  net of tax  o a positive minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax  o  for the acquisition of treasury stock  o million related to stock option exercises and stock compensation expense and o  of treasury stock sold and distributed under the deferred directors plan 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december   from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors o cash dividends of million  o an unfavorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of million  net of tax  o a negative minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax  o  for the acquisition of treasury stock  o  related to stock option exercises and stock compensation expense and o  of treasury stock sold and distributed under the deferred directors plan 
in addition  effective january   the company s directors deferred compensation plan was amended to no longer permit diversification outside of company stock and to require that settlement of deferred balances be made in shares of company stock 
in accordance with eitf accounting for deferred compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and invested  on the date of the plan change  the  current value of the liability for the company shares was transferred to additional paid in capital from other liabilities 
subsequent payments under the directors deferred plan of  and  were made to paid in capital under the new plan for and the afs adjustment reflected a basis point increase in the two to five year us treasury rates during due to the fact that the securities portfolio is primarily fixed rate  a negative equity adjustment would likely occur if interest rates increased 
management has factored this into the determination of the size of the afs portfolio to assure that stockholders equity is adequate under various scenarios 
other than those indicated in this management s discussion  management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that would have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital and results of operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations that  if implemented  would have such an effect 
critical accounting policies certain of the company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances 
some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates  in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  determining the fair value of securities and other financial instruments  and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the allowance for loan losses may be difficult to estimate due to changes in economic conditions  the financial condition of borrowers and the fact that there is not always a specific event that triggers a loss 
the company believes that the allowance for loan losses has closely reflected actual loss experience and expects this to continue as adjustments are made for changes occurring in the facts and circumstances affecting the analysis 
additional information detailing the analysis process and methodology is included previously under financial condition 
determining fair value for securities and other financial instruments may be difficult to estimate due to changing market conditions  difficulty in predicting these market changes and changes in interest rates 
the company determines fair value by obtaining current market prices from a third party servicer for the individual securities held at the end of each month and appling these rates to the securities 
the company believes the pricing obtained and rates applied in determining the fair value of securities and other financial instruments has been an accurate estimate of the instruments fair value at a point in time 
the company monitors the prices obtained and reviews the rates applied in determining fair value on a regular basis  making adjustments when situations warrant and expects the accuracy of these estimates at a point in time to continue 
the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is a complicated estimate due to the number of assumptions that could be used to value the servicing retained and the servicing rights themselves are not tangible 
the company does not have a large mortgage origination business and feels that the business closely reflects industry standards for the amount of mortgage origination activity it conducts 
industry software is used to value the servicing rights  and there are no assumptions applied that could be considered outside industry standards 
fair value is calculated on a loan by loan basis and is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions  specifically prepayment speeds and current interest rates 
adjustments to the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights are made monthly 
newly issued but not yet effective accounting standards fasb statement revised  share based payment requires expensing of stock options effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the company plans to adopt this standard as of july  and will begin expensing any unvested stock options at that time 
the company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have any material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides application guidance that should be used to determine when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the recognition of an impairment loss 
the guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting requirements of eitf until additional implementation guidance is issued and goes into effect 
no other new accounting standards have been issued that are not yet effective that would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
the company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet these potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio 
given current prepayment assumptions  the cash flow from the securities portfolio is expected to provide approximately million of funding in in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   the company had million in federal fund lines with correspondent banks and may borrow up to million at the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the company has its securities in the available for sale afs portfolio 
therefore the company may sell securities to meet funding demands 
management believes that the securities in the afs portfolio are of high quality and would therefore be marketable 
approximately of this portfolio is comprised of federal agency securities or mortgage backed securities directly or indirectly backed by the federal government 
in addition  the company has historically sold mortgage loans on the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create an additional source of funding 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december  to million as of december  the primary driver of this increase was an increase in deposit balances of million 
other sources of funds were proceeds from maturities  calls and principal paydowns of securities of million and proceeds from loan sales of million 
the primary use of funds was a million increase in net loans  which is net of approximately million in loans originated and sold during other uses of funds were purchases of securities of million and payments on long term borrowings of million 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million as of december  to million as of december  the primary driver of this decrease was an increase in net loans of million  which is net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during a falling rate environment during the first half of the year contributed to an increase in demand for residential real estate mortgage loans 
other uses of funds were purchases of securities of million and payments on long term borrowings of million 
sources of funds were proceeds from loan sales of million and proceeds from maturities  calls and principal paydowns of securities of million 
other sources of funds were proceeds from long term borrowings of million  proceeds from the sale of securities of million and a net increase in deposits of million 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december  to million as of december  a million increase in deposit balances was the primary driver behind this change 
other sources of funds included proceeds from the sale of loans of million  proceeds from calls and maturities of securities totaling million and proceeds from long term borrowings of million 
uses of funds were purchases of securities of million  an increase in net loans of million  which is net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during  and an increase in other assets of million due primarily to payments for an investment in bank owned life insurance totaling million 
the following tables disclose information on the maturity of the company s contractual long term obligations and commitments 
certificates of deposit listed are those with original maturities of year or more 
payments due by period one year after total or less years years years in thousands certificates of deposit     long term debt   operating leases subordinated debentures   total contractual long term cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total amount one year over one committed or less year in thousands unused loan commitments    commercial letters of credit  standby letters of credit   total commitments and letters of credit    inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more of the components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having a corresponding affect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the company 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the reverse situation may occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management alco and securities interest rate risk represents the company s primary market risk exposure 
the company does not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  does not own any derivative financial instruments and does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the board of directors annually reviews and approves the alco policy used to manage interest rate risk 
this policy sets guidelines for balance sheet structure  which are designed to protect the company from the impact that interest rate changes could have on net income  but does not necessarily indicate the effect on future net interest income 
given the company s mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest bearing assets on december   the net interest margin could be expected to decline in a falling interest rate environment and conversely  to increase in a rising rate environment 
the low rate environment during continued to have an adverse affect on the net interest margin 
in july of the federal open market committee fomc began increasing the target federal funds rate at what they defined as a measured pace 
the fomc increased the target federal funds rate a total of percent over the five meetings in the period of august  through december   with an additional increase of percent in january these increases had a positive impact on the net interest margin during the later part of future changes in the net interest margin will be dependent upon multiple factors including further actions by the fomc during  competitive pressures in the various markets served  and changes in the structure of the balance sheet in response to customer demands for products and services 
the company utilizes a computer program to stress test the balance sheet under a wide variety of interest rate scenarios 
the model quantifies the income impact of changes in customer preference for products  basis risk between the assets and the liabilities that support them and the risk inherent in different yield curves  as well as other factors 
the alco committee reviews these possible outcomes and makes loan  investment and deposit decisions that maintain reasonable balance sheet structure in light of potential interest rate movements 
although management does not consider gap ratios in this planning  the information can be used in a general fashion to look at asset and liability mismatches 
the company s cumulative repricing gap ratio as of december  for the next months using a rates unchanged scenario was a negative of earning assets 
the following tables provide information regarding the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for loans  securities and liabilities with contractual maturities  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities  as well as the company s historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of residential and home equity loans and mortgage backed securities
