operation of properties the day to day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements 
the operator supervises production  maintains production records  employs field personnel and performs other functions 
devon is the operator of  of its wells 
as operator  devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area 
in presenting its financial data  devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense  which is a common industry practice 
organization structure devon s north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas 
operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin  the mid continent  the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions 
canadian properties are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia 
properties outside north america are located primarily in azerbaijan  china  egypt and areas in west africa  including equatorial guinea  gabon  and cote d ivoire 
additionally  devon has exploratory interests  but no current producing assets  in other international countries including angola  brazil  nigeria and syria 
maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed devon to improve operating and capital efficiency

permian basin devon s permian basin assets are located in portions of southeast new mexico and west texas 
these assets include conventional oil and gas properties producing from a wide variety of geologic formations and depths 
the permian basin represented of devon s proved reserves at december  devon s leasehold position in southeast new mexico encompasses more than  net acres of developed lands and  net acres of undeveloped land and minerals 
historically  devon has been a very active operator in this area  developing gas from the high productivity morrow formation and oil in the lower risk delaware formation 

table of contents in the west texas portion of the permian basin  devon maintains a base of oil production with long life reserves 
many of these reserves are from both operated and non operated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the wasson odc unit  the willard unit  the reeves unit  the north welch unit and the anton irish clearfork unit 
these oil producing units often exhibit low decline rates 
devon also owns a significant acreage position in west texas with over  net acres of developed lands and over  net acres of undeveloped land and minerals at december  mid continent the mid continent region includes portions of texas  oklahoma and kansas 
these areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas 
devon s mid continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties 
however  the barnett shale in north texas  acquired by devon in  is a non conventional gas resource 
the mid continent region represented of devon s proved reserves at december  approximately of devon s proved reserves in the mid continent area are in the barnett shale 
the barnett shale  devon s largest producing field  is known as a tight gas formation 
this means that in its natural state  the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas 
however  the application of available technology has made the barnett shale a low risk and highly profitable natural gas operation 
devon holds  net acres and over  producing wells in the barnett shale 
devon s average working interest is approximately 
devon has experienced success extracting gas from the barnett shale by using light sand fracturing 
light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques  is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells to increase production rates 
devon is also applying horizontal drilling  closer well spacing and reservoir optimization techniques to further enhance the value of the barnett shale 
devon s marketing and midstream operations gather and process its barnett shale production along with barnett shale production from unrelated third parties 
the gathering system consists of approximately  miles of pipeline  a mmcf per day gas processing plant  and a  bbls per day ngl fractionator 
in  devon plans to drill a total of new barnett shale wells including horizontals and verticals 
about two thirds of the horizontal wells will be drilled outside the core development area in an effort to further expand the productive area of the field 
the barnett shale is expected to continue to be an important producing area for devon for the foreseeable future 
current net production from the barnett shale is approximately mboe per day 
rocky mountain devon s operations in the rocky mountain region include properties in wyoming  montana  utah  and northern new mexico 
these assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed natural gas projects 
as of december   the rocky mountain region comprised of devon s proved reserves 
approximately of devon s proved reserves in the rocky mountains are from coalbed natural gas 
devon began producing coalbed natural gas in the san juan basin of new mexico in the mid s and began drilling coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin of wyoming in as of december   devon had approximately  producing coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin 
devon s net coalbed natural gas production from the basin was approximately mmcf per day as of december  devon plans to drill new wells and deepen existing wells in the powder river basin in current production in the basin is primarily from the wyodak coal formation 
development of the deeper big george formation is expanding the play into the western portion of the powder river basin 
devon also plans to plug and abandon wells in the powder river basin in 
table of contents devon s most significant conventional gas project in the rocky mountain region is the washakie field in wyoming 
devon is continuing to develop and grow production from this field 
in  devon added producing wells in the washakie field and plans to drill another wells in devon has interests in over  gross acres and an inventory of more than drilling locations 
devon s current net production from washakie is approximately mboe per day 
gulf coast onshore devon s gulf coast onshore properties are located in south and east texas  louisiana and mississippi 
most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations 
at december   the gulf coast accounted for approximately of devon s proved reserves 
devon s operations in south texas have focused on exploration in the edwards  wilcox and frio vicksburg formations 
devon has high working interests  up to  in several producing fields 
east texas is an important conventional gas producing region for devon 
carthage and groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas 
wells produce from the cotton valley sands  the travis peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates 
devon has interests in nearly  producing wells in east texas and plans to drill wells in carthage and wells in groesbeck in devon s current net production from east texas is about mboe per day 
gulf offshore the offshore gulf of mexico accounted for of devon s production and of year end proved reserves 
devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in the gulf of mexico and operates platforms and caissons 
gulf of mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth 
the shelf is defined by water depths of feet or less 
the deep water is at depths beyond feet 
devon operates in both the shelf and deepwater areas 
however  devon expects to divest a significant number of its gulf of mexico shelf producing assets in in  devon commenced production from two new deepwater fields 
red hawk garden banks commenced production in july and is currently producing in excess of mmcf of gas per day 
devon has a working interest in red hawk 
magnolia garden banks began producing oil and gas in december 
in february  magnolia was producing about mboe per day net to devon s working interest from two of an expected eight total producing wells 
in addition to its producing properties  devon has a significant inventory of exploration prospects in the gulf of mexico 
devon has an interest in undeveloped blocks on the shelf and undeveloped deepwater blocks 
on the shallow water shelf  the industry is beginning to explore for oil and gas reserves at depths in excess of  feet 
devon has an interest in of these deep shelf prospects and expects to drill as many as deep shelf exploratory wells during in the deepwater gulf of mexico  almost all historical production of oil and gas has been from miocene aged reservoirs 
devon currently produces approximately mboe per day from the deepwater gulf and has an inventory of undrilled miocene prospects 
during  devon expects to drill exploratory wells on four miocene prospects 
in recent years  the industry has begun to explore for oil below the miocene in older formations that are collectively referred to as the lower tertiary 
to date  devon has participated in three lower tertiary discoveries and has an interest in additional undrilled lower tertiary prospects 
cascade walker ridge was drilled in and was devon s first discovery in the lower tertiary trend 
devon has a working interest in the discovery and expects to drill an appraisal well on the prospect in devon s second lower tertiary discovery was in at st 
malo walker ridge 
during  devon appraised the st 
malo discovery with a second well 
the st 
malo appraisal well encountered more than net feet of oil pay 
devon has a working interest in 
table of contents st 
malo and plans to drill a second appraisal well on the st 
malo prospect in in  devon drilled its third lower tertiary discovery at jack walker ridge 
the jack well encountered more than net feet of oil pay 
devon has a working interest in jack and plans to drill an appraisal well on the prospect in in addition  devon plans to test at least one additional lower tertiary prospect during canada devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in canada and operates in most of the producing basins in western canada 
as of december   of devon s proved reserves were canadian 
devon s canadian assets will be reduced by the planned non core property divestiture program 
many of the canadian basins where devon operates are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen 
consequently  the winter season  from december through march  is the most active drilling period 
devon expects to drill about wells in the winter program and spend million  or nearly half of the full year canadian capital budget 
the deep basin in west central alberta accounted for of devon s canadian proved reserves at december  devon holds  net undeveloped acres in the deep basin  where it drilled wells in and has another very active drilling program planned for the profitability of devon s operations in the deep basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area 
deep basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids  producing up to barrels of ngls with each mmcf of gas 
other important conventional oil and gas exploration and development areas for devon in canada include the peace river arch  northeast british columbia and the central plains 
devon drilled  and wells  respectively  in these areas in devon also drills for and produces cold flow heavy oil in the lloydminster area of alberta and saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of  to  feet 
lloydminster accounted for of devon s canadian proved reserves 
the oil sands of eastern alberta are a vast north american hydrocarbon resource 
devon holds over  net acres of oil sands leases in alberta 
in december  devon received final regulatory approval to proceed with development of its jackfish oil sands project  in which devon has a working interest 
the project is expected to produce mbbls per day of thermal heavy oil when fully operational in devon expects to invest million at jackfish in for site preparation  facilities construction and initial well drilling 
devon also owns interests in the surmont and dover oil sands projects which are among those expected to be divested in international in addition to its core properties in the united states and canada  devon also looks outside north america for longer term reserve and production growth 
at december   these international areas accounted for of devon s worldwide proved reserves 
the most significant international producing property is the exxonmobil operated zafiro oil field on block b  offshore equatorial guinea in west africa 
during  devon s share of production from zafiro averaged mbbls per day 
devon s share of production from zafiro is expected to be reduced by about in the expected reduction is the result of field decline and a change in devon s share of production under the terms of the production sharing contract 
devon will continue drilling development wells on block b in devon has also identified exploratory prospects on block b and on three additional blocks in equatorial guinea in which it has interests 
exploratory wells on blocks b and p are planned for 
table of contents devon also has active offshore exploration programs in other countries in west africa and brazil 
devon made a discovery in offshore brazil on block bm c and plans follow up drilling in devon also plans to drill potentially high impact exploratory wells offshore nigeria and angola in devon s second most significant international producing asset is its panyu project offshore china 
panyu  in the pearl river mouth of the south china sea  was discovered in panyu production began late in field production peaked in and averaged about mbbls per day to devon s interest during the year 
devon plans to drill and complete up to additional development wells and test two or three exploratory prospects in the area during devon expects its net production from panyu to average about mbbls per day in in azerbaijan  devon has a carried working interest in the azeri chirag gunashli  or acg  oil development project in the caspian sea 
devon estimates that the acg field contains over billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves 
oil production from the acg field will increase dramatically upon completion of the baku t bilisi ceyhan pipeline  which is expected in devon s net share of acg production is expected to peak between  to  barrels per day in or devon also holds interests in cote d ivoire  gabon  ghana  egypt  russia  indonesia and syria 
in  devon entered into several joint ventures with partners to test devon s exploratory acreage in egypt 
title to properties title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry  liens for current taxes not yet due and  in some instances  other encumbrances 
devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 
as is customary in the industry  other than a preliminary review of local records  little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties 
investigations  generally including a title opinion of outside counsel  are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 
item legal proceedings royalty matters numerous gas producers and related parties  including devon  have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal false claims act 
the suits allege that the producers and related parties used below market prices  improper deductions  improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and indian owned or controlled lands 
the principal suit in which devon is a defendant is united states ex rel 
wright v 
chevron usa  inc et al 
the wright case 
the suit was originally filed in august in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  but was consolidated in october with the other suits for pre trial proceedings in the united states district court for the district of wyoming 
on july   the district of wyoming remanded the wright case back to the eastern district of texas to resume proceedings 
trial is set for february if the suit continues to advance 
devon believes that it has acted reasonably  has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit  and has paid royalties in good faith 
devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith 
devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by devon 
a significant portion of such production is  or will be  transported through facilities owned by thunder creek gas services  llc  of which devon owns a interest 
devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law  and devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation
