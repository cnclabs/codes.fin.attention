table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
amounts in prior years annual reports are reclassified when necessary to conform to the current year s presentation 
all share and per share information for all periods presented has been adjusted for a three for two split of our common stock that was effected as a dividend to stockholders of record as of october  overview we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from our subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of products and services to our commercial and consumer customers  and currently operate banking facilities throughout the chicago metropolitan area 
we reported net income applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  of million or per diluted common share  compared with million or per diluted common share for the year ended december  the increased net income applicable to common stockholders was a result of reduced noninterest expense and reduced preferred stock dividends 
noninterest expense declined million  or  for the year ended december  as compared with we achieved the reduction in noninterest expense through reduced salary and advertising expense as well as a lower charge relating to our facilities initiatives 
we also lowered our cost of capital by redeeming our series a  preferred stock with the proceeds from junior subordinated debentures in mid the lower interest rate and the tax deductibility of the interest on the debentures  as compared to the preferred stock dividends  resulted in after tax savings of approximately  in we reported net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  during  compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  during our net loss applicable to common stockholders during resulted from a charge of million in connection with the settlement of litigation associated with the company s acquisition of the bank in see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned litigation and settlement for further details of the litigation settlement charge 
without the net million litigation settlement charge  the company would have recorded net income applicable to common stockholders in of million  or per diluted common share 
net income applicable to common stockholders in  was million less than net income exclusive of the litigation settlement charge 
the lower level of income was primarily a result of decreased net interest income and noninterest income 
the decline in diluted earnings per share was also a result of an increase in the number of common shares outstanding 
in october  the company issued  additional shares in an initial public offering 
management uses certain non gaap financial measures and ratios to evaluate the company s performance 
specifically  management reviews net income and the related earnings per share amounts excluding the million litigation settlement charge during we believe that excluding the non recurring litigation settlement charge from both net income and earnings per share presents a more suitable comparison of our period to period results because of the extraordinary nature of the litigation that led to the settlement charge and 
table of contents the likelihood that such a significant event will not reoccur

total stockholders equity was million at december  compared to million at year end  a decrease of million 
the lower stockholders equity reflects the redemption of the million series a preferred stock in mid capital transactions on june   tayc capital trust ii  our wholly owned non consolidated subsidiary  issued million of trust preferred securities in a private placement 
the trust preferred securities were sold under an exemption from registration under the securities act of  as amended  and have not been registered under the securities act or any state securities laws 
tayc capital trust ii invested the proceeds  along with million received from us for the purchase of its common equity securities  in million of junior subordinated debentures issued by taylor capital group  inc on july   we used the proceeds from the junior subordinated debentures to redeem all of our outstanding shares of series a noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 
the redemption price was the stated liquidation value of the series a preferred stock of per share  totaling million  plus  of accrued and unpaid dividends since the last dividend distribution date 
the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures after issuance costs and redemption of the series a preferred stock were used for general corporate purposes 
on october   we completed a concurrent offering of common stock and trust preferred securities 
we issued  shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of per share 
concurrently  we raised million of gross proceeds through the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of trust preferred securities by tayc capital trust i  our wholly owned non consolidated subsidiary 
on november   we sold an additional  shares of common stock to our underwriters pursuant to an option granted in connection with the initial public offering to cover over allotments and received additional net proceeds of million 
the total net amount raised from the initial public offering of common stock and the trust preferred securities and the subsequent exercise by our underwriters of the over allotment option was million 
we used million to settle the litigation described below 
in 
table of contents addition  we used million to restructure and reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
see the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements junior subordinated debentures for additional details 
litigation and settlement during  we agreed to settle outstanding litigation concerning our acquisition of the bank 
we entered into certain settlement agreements with the plaintiffs and other parties in the cases to halt the substantial expense  inconvenience  and distraction of continued litigation and to eliminate any exposure and uncertainty that may have existed as a result of such litigation 
these agreements provided that  subject to our completion of a public offering of trust preferred and common securities and the dismissal of the lawsuits  we would pay an amount equal to million  plus a contingent amount based on the offering price of the common shares  minus a minimum of million as a partial reimbursement to us of offering expenses 
the settlement of this litigation was completed on october  following our initial public offering of common stock and trust preferred securities 
from the net proceeds of these offerings  we paid million in full satisfaction of our obligation under the settlement agreements 
we recorded a million charge to earnings in to reflect the cost of settling this litigation 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our accounting policies are contained in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies 
certain accounting policies require us to use significant judgment and estimates  which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of 
table of contents loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
the significant uncertainties surrounding our portfolio of borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments and competitive challenges as well as management and other changes greatly complicate the estimate of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  actual losses may vary from current estimates 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
goodwill impairment we have goodwill of million that we recognized in connection with our acquisition of the bank 
we test this goodwill annually for impairment  or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carry value may not be recoverable 
most recently  we tested goodwill for impairment as of july  and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
the evaluation for impairment includes comparing the estimated fair market value of the bank to our carrying value for the bank 
because there is not a readily observable market value for the bank  the estimation of the fair market value is based on the market price of our common stock adjusted for the junior subordinated debentures and the notes payable at the holding company 
income taxes at times  we apply different tax treatment for selected transactions for tax return purposes than for income tax financial reporting purposes 
the different positions result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations  and interpretations  and our accruals for income taxes include reserves for these differences in position 
our estimate of the value of these reserves contains assumptions based upon our past experience and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  and we believe that the level of these reserves is reasonable 
a reserve is utilized or reversed once the applicable statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved 
it is likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amounts we have accrued 
results of operations as of and for the years ended december    and net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income earned on interest earning assets  including investment securities and loans  and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  a slight increase from the million of net interest income in net interest income increased less than half of one percent  as 
table of contents the benefit from the increase in interest earning assets was largely offset by a basis point decline in our net interest margin 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was for all of compared to for our net interest margin declined during the first six months of  as the yield on our interest earning assets declined more than the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
however  with the increase in short term interest rates during the last six months of  the yield on our loan portfolio increased 
our interest earning asset yields were   and for the first through the fourth quarters of  respectively 
over that same time period  the costs of funds  including the impact of noninterest bearing demand deposits  were   and for the first through the fourth quarters of  respectively 
the third and fourth quarters of included the incremental interest expense of approximately  arising from the million of junior subordinated debentures issued in june  which increased interest expense by basis points each quarter 
average interest earning assets during increased million  or  to billion as compared to billion during an increase in average loans  primarily in our commercial portfolio  produced the increase in average earning assets 
average commercial loans increased million  or  during to billion as compared to billion during this increase was partly offset by lower consumer related loans 
a million increase in average investment securities also contributed to the increase in average earning assets 
the asset growth was funded primarily with time deposits 
total average time deposits were billion during  a million increase from average time deposits of million during higher average brokered and customer certificates of deposit produced the majority of the increase 
additional funding was also provided by a million increase in average non interest bearing demand deposits 
the interest rate risk position of our overall balance sheet is asset sensitive  which means our assets are expected to re price before our liabilities over the one year horizon 
this balance sheet structure provides opportunity for an increase in net interest margin during periods of rising interest rates  such as we experienced during the last half of  as the bank s prime lending rate increased basis points over that period 
if interest rates remain unchanged in future periods  we would expect to be exposed to the negative impact of a large percentage of our interest bearing liabilities repricing at current market rates  while a large portion of our assets has already repriced 
if interest rates continue to gradually rise in future periods  we would expect our net interest margin to increase 
see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks for further discussion on the impact of interest rates 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million during the net interest income declined because of compression in our net interest margin  despite an increase in average interest earning assets 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was during compared to during the low interest rate environment negatively impacted our net interest margin during our interest earning asset yield declined basis points to during from during however  the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined only basis points from during to during the million of junior subordinated debentures  which were issued in october  caused approximately basis points of the decline in the net interest margin between the two annual periods 
the tax equivalent net interest spread was during as compared to during average interest earning assets during rose to billion  an increase of million  or  as compared to average interest earning assets of billion during growth in the loan portfolio accounted for the majority of the increase in average interest earning assets 
an increase in cash equivalent balances of million accounted for the remainder of the increase in average interest earning assets 
average total loans were billion during compared to billion during a million  or  increase in 
table of contents average commercial and commercial real estate loans produced most of the loan growth 
the increase in commercial loans was partly offset by lower residential mortgage  home equity and consumer loans  products that we chose to de emphasize 
between the two annual periods  the yield on loans declined basis points to during as compared to during the asset growth was funded with interest bearing deposit balances  with time deposit balances comprising the majority of the increase 
average time deposit balances increased to million during compared to million during higher average brokered and out of local market certificates of deposit produced the majority of the increase 
as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming an effective tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  the earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments 
the following table reconciles the tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income as reported on the consolidated statements of income

net interest margin is determined by dividing taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets 

table of contents the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest paid resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a fully taxable equivalent basis

for additional information concerning this determination  see the sections of this discussion and analysis captioned application of critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets and impaired loans and allowance for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses was million during  an increase of  or  over the provision for loan losses of million in the increase in the provision was mainly due to the growth in commercial loans 
net charge offs totaled million during compared to million in our provision of million during was  or  less than the provision of million during the lower provision in as compared to was due to a more favorable outlook  based on evaluations of key qualitative factors  including the economic environment and the continuing improvement in our credit administration 
net charge offs totaled million in we expect our provisioning to fluctuate as the circumstances of our individual commercial borrowers and the economic environment changes 
accordingly  the provision for loan losses in any accounting period is not an indicator of provisioning in subsequent reporting periods 

table of contents noninterest income the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the composition of our noninterest income year ended december  in thousands service charges trust and investment management fees gain on sale of trust assets mortgage banking activities gain on sale of investment securities  net loan syndication fees letter of credit fees atm fees other noninterest income total noninterest income loan syndication fees in were formerly reported as part of net interest margin 
our noninterest income was million during  a decrease of  or  as compared to the million of noninterest income in lower service charges  partly offset by an increase in trust  investment management and loan syndication fees  produced the decrease 
noninterest income of million during was million  or  less than the noninterest income of million during most of the decline was due to gains realized on the sale of investment securities of million during in addition  lower trust and investment management income and losses from mortgage banking activities in also contributed to the decline 
the receipt of million in loan syndication fees and higher letter of credit fees in partly offset these decreases 
service charges arise principally on deposit accounts 
service charges declined to million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
reported service charge income is impacted by a number of factors including the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
the decrease in service charge revenue during was mainly caused by lower commercial service charge income as a result of reduced activity fees 
trust and investment management fees include corporate trust  land trust and tax deferred exchange trust services  as well as wealth management services  such as financial planning  insurance  and asset management services 
total trust and investment management fees increased  or  to million in compared to million in corporate and exchange trust fees increased  to million producing the increase in revenues 
total trust and investment management fees in declined  or  because we exited fiduciary personal and employee benefit trust services in late during the second half of  we sold a portion of these lines of trust business and recorded a gain of  which is reported separately in the table above 
we have signed a letter of intent to potentially sell our land trust business in in  land trust revenues totaled million 
we incurred losses related to our mortgage banking activities of  and  during and  respectively 
the losses resulted from indemnification agreements on loans sold in prior periods 
no such losses were incurred in as of december   we had approximately million of loans that we had sold in prior years for which we had agreed to indemnify a third party for losses that may result from underwriting or documentation deficiencies 
the losses recorded include actual indemnification losses incurred to date as well as our estimate of future losses from sold loans still outstanding and subject to such indemnification agreements 
revenue from mortgage banking activities was  for the year ended december  we discontinued most mortgage banking activities during 
table of contents during  we recorded a net gain on the sale of investment securities of  the net gain primarily resulted from the sale of million of us government agency securities with short remaining maturities 
the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in longer duration  higher yielding securities 
in addition  we sold low par value mortgage backed securities to enhance the operational efficiency of our investment portfolio 
we recorded no gains or losses on the sale of investment securities in net gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities totaled million during  resulting from the sale of million of us government agency securities 
we reinvested the proceeds from these sales in us government agency securities with longer maturities to extend the duration of the investment portfolio 
during  we received million of loan syndication fees compared to million in in our annual report the loan syndication fees were included in loans fees and therefore  were reported as part of net interest income 
no such fees were received in these fees were earned through the syndication of certain commercial real estate development loans for our customers 
while professional real estate developers have for years been a significant part of our commercial banking business  we have not been active in loan syndication 
we expect the opportunity to provide this service to recur  but not necessarily on a routine  predictable basis 
atm fees have declined since as the number of automatic teller machines we have deployed in our market has decreased 
other noninterest income principally includes safe deposit rental fees and gains losses from equity  partnership or deferred compensation plan investments and totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
noninterest expense the following table presents for the periods indicated the composition of our noninterest expense for the year ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits salaries  employment taxes  and medical insurance incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits total salaries and employee benefits occupancy of premises furniture and equipment lease abandonment and termination charge building sale write down corporate insurance computer processing holding company legal fees  net bank legal fees  net advertising and public relations consulting other real estate and repossessed asset expense other intangible assets amortization litigation settlement charge other noninterest expense total noninterest expense 
table of contents our noninterest expense in was million compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in noninterest expense was primarily a result of our efforts to reduce our operating expenses 
salaries and benefits and advertising expense declined in compared to in addition  in we recorded a  charge to terminate an operating lease for our former administrative offices in wheeling  illinois 
in  we recorded a million charge when we abandoned the wheeling facility as part of our corporate center consolidation 
noninterest expense in was million compared to million during excluding the litigation settlement charge of million in  noninterest expense for would have decreased million  or  as compared to lower net legal fees and salaries and benefits expense  partially offset by the million charge for the abandonment of a leased facility  resulted in the lower noninterest expense in salaries and employee benefits represent the largest category of our noninterest expense 
total salaries and benefits during were million compared to million during  and million in  reflecting decreases of million and million  respectively 
as part of our initiative to reduce our operating expenses  we have reduced our workforce and eliminated positions throughout the organization 
the number of full time equivalent employees decreased almost to at the end of compared to at the end of and at the end of total costs for salaries  employment taxes and medical expenses in was million compared to million in and million in salary expense in each year included severance expense of million in   in and million in total incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits were million for compared to million for  and million for salaries and employee benefits expense in and in the future will be impacted by the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 share based payment sfas r  which is revised and reissued guidance on the accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r eliminates the intrinsic value method that we currently use to account for the granting of employee stock options 
beginning in the third quarter of  we will be required to record compensation expense in the future for all existing stock options that have not vested as of june  and for all future grants of employee stock options 
while  we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements and the transitional provisions of sfas r  we expect to record increased salary and employee benefit expense as a result of implementation 
see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned new accounting pronouncements for additional details 
total noninterest expense  including occupancy of premises and furniture and equipment  has been impacted and will continue to be impacted by our initiative to rationalize our occupancy space 
we have taken steps to both consolidate our administrative and operating departments and to modify our banking center profile 
during late  we transitioned our administrative and operations departments to our new corporate center   square feet of leased office space in rosemont  illinois 
we moved departments to the corporate center that were previously located in our wheeling  ashland  and burbank facilities 
we pursued alternatives regarding these vacated facilities  all of which previously held administrative offices as well as banking centers 
in june  we sold our burbank facility and agreed to lease back approximately one half of the space for our existing banking center and the lending offices that remained at that location 
upon sale  we realized a gain of approximately  that was deferred and is being amortized over the year life of the new operating lease 
in december  we also completed the sale of our ashland property 
we agreed to sell this property in and recorded a  charge at that time to reduce the book value of the property to the expected net sales price 
we retained a smaller parcel of land to build a smaller banking facility that we expect to operational in late in the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement to terminate the existing operating lease at the abandoned wheeling facility 
we closed this transaction on february  and upon termination of our obligation under the existing lease  we signed a new year operating lease for a smaller portion of that facility for a banking center 
we have also modified our banking center profile by opening two new banking centers and exiting two others 
during the second quarter of  we opened a  square foot leased banking center in itasca  illinois  
table of contents a northwest suburb of chicago 
we also signed an operating lease for a  square foot facility in orland park  illinois  a southern suburb of chicago 
we expect the orland park facility to open during the first half of in october of  we closed our jackson banking center just before its operating lease expired 
finally  on january   we completed the sale of our broadview banking center 
see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned financial condition non earning assets for additional details 
our occupancy of premises expense was million during as compared to million during  an increase of  most of the increase was due to higher rent expense resulting for our new rosemont corporate center and rent payments on the new operating lease at our burbank facility that began in the third quarter of these increases were partly offset by a decline in depreciation of building related improvements related to the abandonment of our wheeling and burbank facilities 
our occupancy of premises expense increased  or  to million during from million during most of the increase was associated with the additional space leased for our new rosemont corporate center 
furniture and equipment expense was million during compared to million during both and the increase in expense during resulted from additional depreciation from the new furniture and equipment acquired in the fourth quarter of in connection with the corporate center consolidation 
in connection with the corporate center consolidation  we abandoned our administrative offices on the second and third floors of our wheeling facility  a  square foot facility 
upon ceasing to use this space in  we recorded a million lease abandonment charge 
the charge was comprised of a  write off of leasehold improvements  furniture and other equipment that were abandoned and a million charge for the liability related to the operating lease that represented the estimated liability for the lease payments that we would incur for the remaining term of the lease for which we would receive no future economic benefit other than through subleasing 
the abandonment liability was reduced by  in as we made rent payments 
during  we continued to pursue alternatives to terminate this lease obligation  which was scheduled to end in march at the end of  we reached an agreement to terminate the lease for a cash payment of million and the transfer of a small parcel of land we owned next to the site 
in connection with this agreement  we recorded an additional charge of  in the fourth quarter of to increase our lease termination liability to million  write off the small parcel of land  and accrue the related transaction costs 
on february   we closed this transaction and terminated the lease 
no additional expense was recorded in the first quarter of related to this lease termination transaction 
upon termination of our obligation under the existing lease  we signed a new year operating lease for  square feet on the first floor of the facility for a smaller banking center 
we expect to save approximately  per year by operating the smaller space at this facility 
corporate insurance totaled million during  compared to million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
an adjustment to our directors and officers insurance coverage  among other factors  caused the decrease in expense during the increase in expense during  as compared to  was caused by higher costs for our directors and officers insurance policy associated with the first full year of a being a publicly traded company 
our computer processing expense is comprised of payments to third party processors  primarily for our mission critical data processing applications including loans  deposits  and general ledger and atm operations 
our computer processing expense was million  million  and million during years ending december    and  respectively 
a slight decline in expense for our primary data processing vendor caused the declines 
currently  holding company legal fees consist primarily of costs for general corporate matters  including securities law compliance and other costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
during  holding company legal fees included costs related to the defense and settlement of litigation concerning our acquisition of the bank 
portions of our defense costs related to the litigation  which were recorded as expenses 
table of contents in previous periods  had been submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement 
during  we received a million reimbursement of such legal costs 
we received no such reimbursements in or and we do not expect to receive any further reimbursements related to that litigation 
because of the reimbursement received in  we reported higher holding company legal expenses during and as compared to bank legal fees relate to collection activities as well as general corporate and compliance matters 
legal fees were million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
the decline in expense during  as compared to resulted from lower legal fees incurred in our special asset loan work out area 
in addition to the decrease in gross expense  we were able to obtain more in reimbursements from these borrowers than in prior years 
the higher legal fees in as compared to were primarily caused by increased collection activity and professional fees related to our decision to exit some non core lines of business and to develop new products and services for our core business banking customers 
we substantially reduced our advertising activities during  resulting in a million  or  decrease to million in from million in advertising and public relations expense was million during our advertising expense increased in because of a media campaign to increase the bank s visibility in the business community 
this campaign included television commercials  which began airing in  print advertising  and the introduction of a new corporate identity with a more contemporary logo 
the costs of producing the television commercials were capitalized in and and were being amortized  beginning in  over three years  which had been the expected time horizon over which the commercials would be aired 
at december   we had capitalized advertising costs totaling  recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
as part of our expense management initiative  we reduced planned advertising activities and discontinued the use of the television advertising campaign 
upon making the decision to discontinue the television advertising  we wrote off the remaining balance of the capitalized advertising costs during the second quarter of consulting expense was  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the higher expense in and was due to projects related to information technology  strategic and facilities planning  and marketing consultation 
other real estate and repossessed asset expense was  for the year ended december   compared to expense of  and  for and  respectively 
the increase in expense during as compared to was associated with higher losses on the disposal of owned real estate properties 
this net expense is influenced to a large degree by the number and complexity of properties being maintained pending their sale

the higher amortization expense in and related to other trust business purchased  the value of which was deemed expired at the end of noninterest expense in reflects a million charge related to our settlement of the split off litigation 
this settlement was funded with a portion of the net proceeds from the concurrent offerings of common stock and trust preferred securities completed in october see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned litigation and settlement for additional details 
the amount of the settlement was based  in part  on the anticipated initial public offering price of our common stock 
after completion of the initial public offering in october  we paid million in full satisfaction of our settlement agreements

because of negative trends in the manufactured housing industry  we recorded the million charge in to establish a reserve related to interest receivable carried in connection with this portfolio 
we increased this reserve by  in  and the reserve represents our estimate of the portion of this prepaid interest receivable that may not be collectable 
no such charges were recorded in in addition  during  we recorded an  charge related to consideration paid for the contractual termination of a revenue sharing agreement associated with the trust business acquired in october as part of that acquisition  we had agreed to share a portion of the trust revenues earned on the accounts purchased over the following five years 
in connection with our exit of certain fiduciary trust activities we have sold some of the trust accounts that were subject to this revenue sharing agreement 
income taxes our income tax expense was million during  resulting in an effective tax rate of  compared to our income tax expense of million during  or an effective income tax rate of 
the higher level of pre tax income caused the increase in income tax expense during the effective tax rates in and were impacted by the recognition of million and million income tax benefits  respectively  relating to expenses deducted on prior years tax returns for which the statute of limitations has expired 
without the recognition of these benefits  the effective income tax rates would have been and for and  respectively 
despite a net loss in  we recorded income tax expense of million primarily because we did not recognize any income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes with respect to the litigation settlement charge of million 
while we have not recognized any income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes for this charge  we did deduct a portion of the settlement on our tax return  representing a possible tax benefit of approximately million 
we will recognize the income tax benefit on our financial statements when we determine that it is probable that the position taken on our tax return will be sustained by the taxing authorities 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services

we purchased a total of million of investment securities in the net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio was million at the end of compared to an unrealized gain of million at the end of the decline in the fair value of the portfolio was due to changes in market interest rates and to a lesser degree prepayment speeds on mortgage related securities 
at december   we had investment securities in an unrealized loss position 
of these securities  six securities have been in a loss position for more than twelve months 
we believe that none of these unrealized losses represents other than temporary impairments of our investment portfolio 
we believe that we have both the intent and ability to hold all of these securities for the time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
our investment portfolio totaled million at december   a decrease of million as compared to the investment portfolio of million at december  the portfolio experienced significant repayments of mortgage related securities in to offset these repayments  we purchased additional mortgage backed securities  and to a lesser extent  collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  and us government agency securities during in addition  the unrealized gain on the available for sale portion of the portfolio declined million due to changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds during the year

table of contents investments in us treasury securities and us government agency securities are generally considered to have low credit risk 
our mortgage backed securities holdings consist principally of direct pass through securities issued by the fannie mae and freddie mac 
these securities are also considered to have low credit risk  but do possess market value risk due to the prepayment risk associated with mortgage backed securities 
our cmos consist primarily of planned amortization class securities that are backed by fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
although cmos are guaranteed as to principal and interest by certain agencies  primarily fannie mae and freddie mac  they possess market risk due to the prepayment risk associated with the underlying collateral 
we generally invest in state and municipal obligations that are rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating organizations 
however  certain municipal issues  which are restricted to our local market area  are not rated and undergo the bank s standard underwriting procedures for loan transactions 
we also have investments in federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock which are required to be maintained for various purposes 
at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities  that exceeded of stockholders equity

the growth in commercial real estate secured loans in and related primarily to investment and income producing commercial properties 
commercial real estate lending has remained strong over the last two years as historically low interest rates have added to the attractiveness of real estate investments

correspondingly  this portfolio as a percentage of total loans has decreased to at year end from at december  we expect that this portfolio of loans will continue to decline

demand loans are included in the one year or less category and totaled million as of december  nonperforming assets and impaired loans lending officers and their managers are responsible for continuous review of present and estimated future performance of the loans within their assigned portfolio and for risk rating such loans in accordance with the bank s risk rating system 
in addition  an objective loan review process independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the effectiveness of the lending officer s loan risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level is reported by the responsible lending officer to a loan committee where consideration is given to placing the loan on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis for recognition of interest income when sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest 
generally  loans are to be placed on nonaccrual when principal and interest is contractually past due days  unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection

certain homogenous loans  including residential mortgage and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and  therefore  do not have individual credit risk ratings and are excluded from impaired loans 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans as well as certain accruing loans judged to have higher risk of noncompliance with the present contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal 
once a loan has been determined to be impaired  it is measured to establish the amount of the impairment 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  the measurement of impairment may not always result in an allowance for loan loss for every impaired loan 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
information about the impaired loans at or for the years ended december    and is as follows in thousands recorded balance of impaired loans  at end of year with related allowance for loan loss with no related allowance for loan loss total allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans  at end of year average balance of impaired loans for the year interest income recognized on impaired loans for the year in addition to the impaired loans  we continue to closely monitor the credit quality trends in the manufactured housing industry and its potential impact on our portfolio of loans secured by manufactured homes 
these trends could lead to higher net charge offs in the future 
at december   our consumer loan portfolio included million of loans to consumers secured by manufactured homes 

table of contents allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial  residential real estate mortgage and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification and in some cases by delinquency status 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  for example home equity loans over loan to value  home equity loans equal to or less than  and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  segmenting loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates for prior years for each separate loan segment identified 
each of the prior years historical loss rates is then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the segments  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the factors assessed are more qualitative in nature 
conditions affecting the entire lending portfolio evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include general economic and business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations and findings of our independent loan review process 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussion with our senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as part of the formula allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such conditions is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

net charge offs were million  or of average loans during in comparison  net charge offs totaled million  or of average loans  during and million  or of average loans  during the provision for loan losses was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
in each year  the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  the loans to which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
at december   our top borrowing customers had balances outstanding from million to million and those loan balances totaled million 
individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
for example  our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 

table of contents the table below presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions

nonearning assets at december  and  we had goodwill of million  created from our acquisition of the bank  which is no longer subject to amortization 
the goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and if at any time impairment exists  we will record an impairment loss 
the goodwill was most recently tested for impairment as of july   and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
premises  leasehold improvements  and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in premises  leasehold improvements and equipment was due to the sale of our burbank and ashland facilities  as well as normal depreciation expense 
we have been executing an initiative to better rationalize our occupancy of premises 
steps that we have taken under this facilities initiative included the following in the fourth quarter of  we transitioned our administrative and operations departments to our new corporate center  a  square feet leased office space in rosemont  illinois 
we consolidated administrative and operating departments that had been at our wheeling  burbank  and ashland facilities to this new corporate center 
in the fourth quarter of  we abandoned our administrative offices on the second and third floors of our wheeling facility as a result of the corporate center consolidation 
upon ceasing to use this space  we recorded a million lease abandonment charge  recorded in noninterest expense 
the charge was comprised of a  write off of leasehold improvements  furniture and other equipment that were abandoned and a million charge for the liability related to the operating lease which was scheduled to continue until march this million charge was computed based upon the remaining lease payments reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could reasonably be obtained from the property 

table of contents the charge represented the estimated liability for the lease payments that we would incur for the remaining term of the lease for which we would receive no economic benefit other than through subleasing 
the liability for lease abandonment was adjusted in as we made lease payments 
in  we reached an agreement to terminate the lease for a cash payment of million and the transfer of a small parcel of land we owned next to the site 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional charge of  to recognize our obligation under the lease termination agreement 
the transaction was closed on february  upon termination of our obligation under the existing lease  we signed a new year operating lease for approximately  square feet on the first floor of the facility for a smaller banking center 
in june  we sold our burbank facility  which had a net book value of million 
upon sale of the burbank facility  we agreed to lease back space on the ground and fourth floors for the banking center and lending departments still at that location 
we had vacated the second and third floors as a result of the corporate center consolidation 
the gain of  realized from the sale was deferred and is being amortized over the year life of the lease 
in december  we also completed the sale of our ashland banking center  which had a book value of million 
we agreed to sell this property in and  at that time  recorded a  loss to reduce the net book value to the estimated net sales price 
we have retained a portion of the land at the site to build a smaller banking center  which is expected to be operational by late we continue to examine our existing network of banking centers 
in june  we opened a  square foot banking center located in an office building in itasca  illinois  a northwest suburb of chicago 
the facility is leased under an operating lease with a three year term 
we also signed a three year operating lease for a  square feet banking center located in orland park  illinois  a southern suburb of chicago 
we expect the banking center to be operational by mid during the fourth quarter of  we closed our leased jackson banking center 
the lease was scheduled to expire in the first quarter of on january   we completed the sale of our broadview banking center 
in addition to selling the physical land and building  we sold approximately million of deposit balances and million of loans associated with the banking center 
we will record a million gain on the sale of this banking center during the first quarter of deposits our core deposits consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand deposits  savings deposits  certificates of deposit  certain public funds and core customer repurchase agreements 
our customer repurchase agreements are reported as short term borrowings 
we also use brokered and other out of local market certificates of deposit and fhlb advances to support our asset base

in addition to selling the physical land and building  we sold approximately million of deposits 
the deposits sold consisted of million of noninterest bearing demand deposits  million of interest bearing demand deposits and million of certificates of deposit 
the sale of these deposits did not have a material impact on our funding or cost of funds 
during  year to date average deposits balances increased million  or  to billion compared to billion during period end deposits increased million or  to billion at december   compared to billion at december  the year to date average deposit balances showed a larger increase than the period end balances because asset growth in the first half of was not maintained in the last half of the year 
we relied on wholesale deposits as a source of funds in  as deposits from customers were essentially flat 
an increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits was largely offset by a decline in interest bearing demand deposits 
year to date average balances of brokered cds rose million during to meet heavy asset funding needs in the first half of the year 
however  period end brokered cds increased by only million at december  from december  additionally  while our year to date average out of local market cd balances increased million to million  the period end balances actually declined by million 
year to date average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million  or 
over the years  our earning asset growth has exceeded our local customer deposit growth  which has resulted in our use of brokered and out of local market certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
we offer certificates of deposit to out of local market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers 
these certificates of deposit are generally issued at amounts of  or less as the purchasers seek to maintain full fdic deposit insurance protection 
the balance of certificates of deposit obtained through this marketing medium was million at december   as compared to million and million at december   and  respectively

under fdic regulations  only well capitalized institutions may fund brokered certificates of deposit without prior regulatory approval 
the bank is categorized as well capitalized 
adverse operating results at the bank or changes in industry conditions or overall market liquidity could lead to our inability to replace brokered deposits at maturity  which could result in higher costs to  or reduced asset levels at  the bank 
we have entered into interest rate exchange contracts to hedge the fair values of brokered certificates of deposit for changes in interest rates 
under these contracts  we receive a fixed interest rate over the term of the agreement and pay a floating interest rate based upon libor 
the notional amount of interest rate exchange contracts used to hedge the fair value of brokered certificates of deposit totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
municipal deposits  consisting of public fund time deposits and repurchase agreements with state and local governments  are a significant funding source for the bank

our short term borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and us treasury tax and loan note option accounts 
the federal funds purchased are primarily noncollateralized funds obtained from financial institutions where the bank acts as one of the selling institution s primary correspondent banks 
the securities sold under agreement to repurchase are collateralized financing transactions and are primarily executed with local bank customers

we are amortizing these costs to interest expense over seven years  the original term of the loans  using the straight line method 
the notes payable require compliance with certain defined financial covenants relating to the bank  including covenants related to regulatory capital  return on average assets  nonperforming assets  and company leverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the agreement also restricts the amount of dividends that we can pay to shareholders and the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to us 
we are restricted from paying annual cash dividends to our common shareholders during a calendar year in excess of of that year s annual net income  additionally the bank is restricted from paying annual cash dividends in a calendar year to us in excess of of that year s bank net income

capital resources we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier i capital includes common stockholders equity  trust preferred securities up to certain limits  and  in prior periods  our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 
goodwill is deducted from tier i capital 
total capital represents tier i capital plus the allowance for loan loss  subject to certain limits  our subordinated note payable and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier i capital 
at december    and  the holding company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
the holding company s regulatory capital ratios declined in as a result of the increase in average and risk weighted assets and the redemption of the preferred stock 
during  we redeemed the million of series a noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  all of which qualified as tier i capital 
the series a preferred stock was redeemed with the proceeds from the issuance of million of trust preferred securities by tayc capital trust ii on june  a portion of the trust preferred securities qualifies as tier i capital and the remainder qualifies as tier ii capital 
as a result  the redemption of the preferred stock and the issuance of the trust preferred securities caused a decline in tier i capital  but no material impact on total capital tier i and tier ii 
total capital increased in because of earnings retention 
at december   although our total regulatory capital increased  our ratios of total capital and tier i capital to risk weighted assets declined due to the increase in our total risk weighted assets 
at december    and  the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
during  the bank s ratio of tier i to risk weighted assets and total capital to risk weighted assets both decreased 
the decrease was a result of higher risk weighted assets  partly offset by an increase in regulatory capital 
regulatory capital increased through earnings retention 
the bank s dividend payout as a percentage of bank net income was for the year ended december  all of the bank s capital ratios increased during  as the bank did not pay dividends to the holding company and growth in equity out paced the higher risk weighted and average assets

we redeemed the series a preferred stock on july   and therefore no longer pay preferred dividends 
during and  we declared preferred stock dividends of per share  totaling million in each year 
as of december   we had purchased  shares of our common stock  at a cost of million  which are held as treasury shares 
previously  under the terms of our employee stock ownership plan  stock option agreements  and the restricted stock program  we were obligated to purchase shares of our stock from 
table of contents terminated employees related to put rights 
we purchased  treasury stock shares during at a total cost of million 
following the completion of our common stock offering  we are no longer obligated to purchase shares of our stock under any of these plans and we purchased no additional treasury shares in or liquidity in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  the bank utilizes brokered and out of local market certificates of deposit  fhlb borrowings  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet its liquidity needs 
we manage the risk associated with reliance on wholesale funding sources by extending and laddering the maturity of these liabilities and pledging collateral 
the fhlb borrowings are collateralized by the bank s first mortgage residential and home equity loans  selected investment securities  and fhlb stock 
in addition  the bank is able to borrow from the federal reserve bank using securities or commercial loans as collateral through the borrower in custody program 
under this program  at december   the bank maintained million of commercial loans as collateral with a lendable value of million 
the bank also maintains pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines at various correspondent banks  which provide additional short term borrowing capacity of million at december  pre approved repurchase agreement availability with major brokers and banks totaled million at december   subject to acceptable unpledged marketable securities 
from december  to december   our total assets increased by million  or 
the increase in total assets was primarily funded with the million increase in deposits 
noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million  brokered and out of local market certificates of deposit increased million and other customer deposits increased million 
cash inflow from operations exceeded cash outflows by million in we believe that our current sources of funds are adequate to meet all of our financial commitments and asset growth targets for during  total assets grew by million  or 
the asset growth was funded almost equally by wholesale deposits and cash provided by operations 
most of the increase in wholesale deposits was from higher brokered cd balances 
cash inflows from operations exceeded cash outflows by million during during  our asset growth was primarily funded with wholesale funds 
during the year  we increased brokered and out of market certificates of deposit by million and million respectively  and increased our borrowings from the fhlb by million 
these additional wholesale sources provided funds for asset growth and net deposit outflows from customers 
the decline in customer deposit balances mainly occurred in money market account balances due to withdrawals by two large deposit commercial customers 
during the year ended december   cash outflows from operating activities exceeded cash inflows by million 
the net outflow was largely due to the million litigation settlement payment made during we used proceeds from the common stock and trust preferred securities offerings to fund this payment 
interest received net of interest paid was the principal source of our operating cash inflows in each of the above periods 
management of investing and financing activities and market conditions determine the level and the stability of our net interest cash flows 
our net cash outflows from investing activities for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
during all three annual periods  the net outflow was caused by increased loans 
in addition  during all three years  cash provided by repayments  maturities  and sales of investment securities were mostly reinvested in the purchase of investment securities 
during  we used million of liquidity to increase our investment portfolio 
our net cash inflows from financing activities for years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
during  a net increase in deposits produced 
table of contents million of cash inflow 
short term borrowings increased by million  while fhlb advances decreased by million because of maturities 
we used proceeds from the issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures to tayc capital trust ii in mid to redeem all of the outstanding series a preferred stock at its stated amount of million 
during  the net inflow was primarily produced by a million increase in deposits  primarily from wholesale sources 
during  from the issuance of  common shares  net of issuance costs  we received proceeds of million  while we received net proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities of million 
in addition  during  cash inflows of million were also provided by deposit growth  primarily from wholesale funding sources 
we also used a portion of the proceeds from the common stock and trust preferred offerings to reduce our notes payable 
holding company liquidity 
historically  our primary source of funds has been dividends received from the bank 
during  the bank declared million of dividends to the holding company 
during  the bank did not declare any dividends because we had sufficient liquidity from the proceeds of our concurrent offering of common and trust preferred securities during  the insurance reimbursement and estimated tax payment refund received in we received million of dividends from the bank during our notes payable agreement with our lender limits the amount of common dividends that the bank can pay to us in any year to of that year s bank net income 
the bank is also subject to dividend restrictions set forth by regulatory authorities  whereby the bank may not  without prior approval of regulatory authorities  declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year s earnings plus the retained earnings from the prior two years 
the dividends  as of december   that the bank could declare and pay to us  without the approval of regulatory authorities  amounts to approximately million 
we also receive funds from the exercise of employee stock options 
we received million during from the exercise of employee stock options  compared to million and  in and  respectively 
we also have an million revolving credit facility  which was not drawn upon at december  our liquidity uses at the holding company level consist primarily of dividends to stockholders  debt service requirements on the debentures issued to tayc capital trust i and tayc capital trust ii  and expenses for general corporate purposes 
we expect the bank to continue paying us dividends during  and we believe that the bank currently has adequate capital to allow continued dividends out of earnings to support our expected liquidity demands arising from our normal operations 
during mid  we received net proceeds  after issuance costs  of million from the issuance of junior subordinated debentures to tayc capital trust ii 
we used most of these proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding series a preferred stock 
the redemption price was the stated value of million  plus  of accrued and unpaid dividends since the last dividend distribution date 
the remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
during  we received net proceeds of million from the common stock offering and million from the trust preferred offering 
these proceeds are net of underwriters discount and issuance costs  such as legal and accounting fees and printing costs 
we used million of the net proceeds from the offerings to fully satisfy our obligations under the litigation settlement agreements related to the acquisition of the bank 
we also used million of the net proceeds to restructure our notes payable and reduce outstanding indebtedness 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit  financial guarantees and derivative financial instruments 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage interest rate risk 
we had commitments to extend credit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other 
table of contents termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts 
historically  approximately of available consumer and commercial loan commitment amounts are drawn 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and  respectively 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees 
the following table shows as of december  the loan commitments and financial guarantees by maturity date 
december  within one year one to three years four to five years after five years total in thousands commitments to extend credit commercial consumer financial guarantees financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit at december   our only derivative financial instruments were interest rate exchange contracts 
an interest rate exchange contract  or swap  is an agreement in which two parties agree to exchange  at specified intervals  interest payment streams calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount with at least one stream based on a specified floating rate index 
our objective in holding interest rate swaps is interest rate risk management 
at december  and  we had interest rate exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million  respectively  to hedge the fair values of certain brokered certificates of deposit for changes in interest rates 
under these contracts  we receive a fixed interest rate over the term of the agreement and pay a floating interest rate based upon libor 
we account for these contracts as fair value hedges and use the short cut method of accounting for changes in fair value 
the short cut method allows us to assume that there is no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship and that changes in the fair value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability  resulting in no volatility in earnings 
during  interest rate exchange agreements with notional amounts totaling million were called by the counterparty 
once we were notified  we called the related brokered certificates of deposit 
during  we entered into an interest rate exchange contract  with a notional amount of million  to hedge the variability in cash flows on million of prime indexed commercial loans 
under the terms of the interest rate exchange contract  we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating rate based upon the prime lending rate 
we account for this as a cash flow hedge  and we expect the contract to be highly effective  over the life of the agreement  in hedging the variability of cash flows on prime indexed loans due to movements in the prime lending rate 
the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded as an asset or liability with the corresponding gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  net of tax 
we review the hedging relationship periodically for effectiveness 
during  we determined the hedging relationship to be highly effective  and we recorded no ineffectiveness during the year 

table of contents during  we entered into interest rate exchange contracts  with a total notional amount of million  to hedge the variability of cash flows of million of prime indexed commercial loans and accounted for these transactions as cash flow hedges 
in october  these interest rate exchange contracts were terminated with the original counterparties 
the resulting gain on termination of  net of taxes  was deferred and recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
this deferred gain is being reclassified as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining term of the original interest rate exchange contracts 
for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  of this deferred gain was reclassified into interest income 
during  an additional  of this deferred gain is expected to be reclassified into interest income 
the following table shows  as of december   our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  debt and lease agreements and for maturing time deposits

other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  or alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps  to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts are designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including off balance sheet financial instruments 
net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of imbedded 
table of contents options in products such as callable and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
our net interest margin increased during the second half of in response to the basis point increase in our prime rate 
our loan interest income increased as our billion in prime indexed  floating rate commercial loans adjusted to higher yields 
critical factors affecting our net interest margin in future periods will be our pricing strategy on deposit products and whether the current yield curve remains unchanged 
our modeling of the december  balance sheet using the market interest rates in effect at year end  indicated increased pressure on the margin in future periods as many of our interest bearing liabilities continue to re price to current rates as they mature 
our simulation modeling of a continued rising rate environment indicates that net interest income would increase 
net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to be million  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  conversely  at december   net interest income at risk for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was calculated at million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
these exposures were within our policy guidelines of 
the direction of our one year exposure to rising and declining interest rates at december  was generally consistent with our exposure at december  in the december  modeling  we used a basis point rising and a basis point falling rate scenarios 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year basis points over one year we also model changes in the shape steepness of the yield curve  other parallel shifts in the yield  such as a basis point increase in interest rates  and balance sheet growth scenarios 
we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing 
the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities 
table of contents anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future deposit activity

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon

application of fin r was effective for interests in certain variable interest entities as of december   and for all other types of variable interest entities for periods ending after march  beginning on january   the fin r guidance required us to deconsolidate tayc capital trust i 
not consolidating the tayc capital trust i did not have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition 
before january   we consolidated tayc capital trust i and reported the million trust preferred securities on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in the company s junior subordinated debentures

the cost of the award will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service 
public entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based upon the current fair value  adjusted at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in the fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation over that period 
sfas r eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options under apb opinion no 
as a result  we will be required to record compensation expense in the future for all existing stock options that have not vested as of june   and for all future grants of employee stock options

in thousands interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income gain loss on sale of investment securities  net noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted risk factors you should read carefully and consider the following risks and uncertainties because they could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the interest rate environment significantly impacts our profitability 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience imbalances in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest earning assets will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest bearing liabilities  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
in addition  loan volume and quality can be affected by market interest rates on loans 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  origination volume and overall profitability 
as of december   our internal financial models indicated an exposure to our net interest income from both declining or static flat rates 
if we experienced no change in the volume and mix of our earning assets and if interest rates were to remain static  while our earning asset yields would likely remain flat our liability rates would likely increase  resulting in a reduced net interest margin 
our net interest income would also be under stress if rates were to fall 
the net interest income at risk for year one in the falling rate scenario of basis points was calculated at million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan and security prepayments  deposit decay and pricing and reinvestment strategies and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 

table of contents we principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of financial instruments 
in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to manage this risk effectively 
if we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
for more information concerning our interest rate sensitivity  see the section of this annual report captioned management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 
our wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth 
we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers 
as a part of our liquidity management  we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments 
as we continue to grow  we are likely to become more dependent on these sources  which include federal home loan bank  or fhlb  advances  brokered deposits  out of local market certificates of deposit  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased 
at december   we had million of fhlb advances  million of brokered deposits  and million of out of local market certificates of deposit outstanding 
at december   we had no broker dealer repurchase agreements 
adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to an inability to replace these additional funding sources at maturity 
our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates 
finally  if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan is greatly complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other changes 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  actual losses may vary from current estimates 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  the loans to which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
for example  our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizeable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
net loan charge offs totaled million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not successfully implement our business strategy and manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in  we began implementing a business strategy that involves an enhanced focus on commercial banking and wealth management activities 
at part of this strategy  we discontinued offering some products and services in order to deploy additional resources to our commercial banking activities 
specifically  we discontinued non customer conforming first mortgage loan originations  some fiduciary trust services and the funding of broker sourced home equity  auto and manufactured housing loans 
as our operations become less diversified  we expect the risks associated with our commercial banking activities to have a greater impact on our overall performance 
our business strategy also has involved increasing our small to middle market business customer base and expanding the range of financial products and services we offer these customers 
this growth may place a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems and resources 
additionally  we must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures to accommodate any future growth 
we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively 
if we fail to do so  our business could be materially harmed 
further  unless our expansion of commercial banking and wealth management activities results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our strategy  our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected 
our business is subject to the vagaries of domestic and international economic conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control and could significantly harm our business 
our business is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control  including economic  political and market conditions  broad trends in industry and finance  legislative and regulatory changes  competition  changes in government monetary and fiscal policies  consolidation within our customer base and within our industry and inflation 
for example  a significant decline in general economic conditions  such as recession  unemployment and other factors beyond our control  would significantly impact our business 
a deterioration in economic conditions may result in a decrease in demand for consumer and commercial credit and a decline in real estate and other asset values 
delinquencies  foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions  and we therefore expect that our servicing costs and credit losses would increase during such periods 
our success is dependent to a significant extent upon economic conditions in the chicago metropolitan area  where virtually all of our loans are originated 
for example  our small and middle market business and commercial real estate customers in the chicago metropolitan area could be significantly affected by a local recession or economic downturn  which may result in an increase of defaults on outstanding loans and reduced demand for future loans  both of which could adversely affect us 
adverse changes in the economy of the chicago metropolitan area could also impair our ability to gather deposits and could otherwise have a negative effect on our business  including the demand for new loans  the ability of customers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our loan portfolio involves loans that are to some degree secured by real estate properties located primarily within the chicago metropolitan area 
in the event that real estate values in the chicago area decline  the value of this collateral would be impaired 
our business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the protection of depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of investors 
as a bank holding company  we 
table of contents are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the federal reserve 
the bank  as an illinois chartered member bank  is subject to regulation and supervision by the illinois commissioner of banks and real estate  which we refer to as the illinois commissioner of banks  and by the federal reserve 
we must undergo periodic examinations by our regulators  who have extensive discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies 
for additional information  see the section of this annual report captioned supervision and regulation 
our failure to comply with state and federal regulations can lead to  among other things  termination or suspension of our licenses  rights of rescission for borrowers  class action lawsuits and administrative enforcement actions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these regulations 
recently enacted  proposed and future legislation and regulations have had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on the financial services industry 
regulatory or legislative changes could cause us to change or limit some of our loan products or the way we operate our business and could affect our profitability 
we are subject to certain operational risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud 
there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years 
misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us  improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information 
employee errors and misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation 
it is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence 
we maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks  including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud 
should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence  or if it is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our losses relating to these operational risks were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these losses related primarily to non employee initiated theft or fraud involving either loan or deposit accounts 
we are subject to security risks relating to our internet banking activities that could damage our reputation and our business 
security breaches in our internet banking activities could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation 
any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information 
we rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data 
these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures that could result in damage to our reputation and our business
