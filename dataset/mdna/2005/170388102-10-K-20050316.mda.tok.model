illegal data access on september   the company found evidence of suspicious activity by a few of its small business customers in the los angeles area 
choicepoint notified law enforcement authorities in los angeles  and they commenced an investigation 
these customers opened choicepoint accounts by using stolen identities and altered documents 
these small business customers were able to access information services containing primarily the following consumer names  current addresses and former addresses  social security numbers  driver s license numbers  other public filings information  including  but not limited to  bankruptcies  liens and judgments  professional licenses  and real property data  and in certain cases  credit reports 
the company understands that a nigerian citizen pled no contest in california state court in connection with this los angeles incident and was sentenced to months in prison 
choicepoint further understands that law enforcement s investigation of the matter is ongoing 
the company s customer procedures include credentialing customers prior to granting them access to information services 
in addition  in its public filings group  the company performs random audits of previously credentialed customers to assess the propriety of their use of choicepoint information services 
in the past  the company has suspended or terminated access to choicepoint information services when account activity seems inconsistent with contract expectations and or when customer audit efforts fail to resolve concerns regarding account usage or permissible purpose 

table of contents as the company did in the recent los angeles incident  choicepoint has worked with law enforcement on other occasions of suspicious activity related to customer use of its information services 
there have been other instances in which the company has received subpoenas and other inquiries from law enforcement regarding activities of its customers  which sometimes related to potentially improper use of choicepoint information services 
in some cases  the company was not provided either the purpose or conclusions of these investigations 
the company is aware of a limited number of past instances that resulted in criminal convictions of certain former customers for activities involving improper use of choicepoint information services

approximately  of these consumers are california residents  and approximately  are residents of other states 
these numbers were determined by conducting searches of choicepoint databases that matched searches conducted by customers who the company believes may have had improper access to choicepoint information services on or after july   the effective date of the california notification law 
because choicepoint databases are constantly updated  the company s search results will never be identical to the search results of these customers 
the california notification law requires the company to notify consumers of unauthorized acquisition of personal information  including first name or first initial and last name combined with social security number  driver s license number or similar unique personal identifiers 
the company has completed mailing notices to approximately  consumers in all states 
substantially all of these notices were sent to consumers who may have been affected as a result of the recent los angeles incident 
the company used the criteria set forth in the california notification law to determine who to notify in each of the states 
the california notification law permits alternative methods for notifying consumers when the notice provider does not have sufficient contact information 
the company will use this alternative method of notice  including posting a notice on its website at www 
choicepoint

however  the company currently does not anticipate a significant increase to its estimate of the number of potentially affected consumers

risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information in this annual report on form k 
these risks are not the only ones facing the company 
choicepoint s business operations could also be impaired by additional risks and uncertainties 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if that happens  the trading prices of our common stock and any other securities we may issue in the future could decline significantly 
effects of customer fraud  actions the company has taken in response to those events  and related litigation and governmental proceedings as described under illegal data access in item of this report  on september   the company found evidence of suspicious activity by a few of its small business customers in the los angeles area 
the company s review of the recent los angeles and other similar incidents is ongoing 
choicepoint is taking a variety of steps to assist the potentially affected consumers that have been identified to date 
in addition  the company announced on march  that it will discontinue certain information services 
choicepoint cannot currently accurately estimate the total impact on its operating results and financial condition of the customer fraud  related events and the decision to discontinue those services 
the company estimates it will encounter a decline in its revenue from these customers in the public filings business  which could reduce total revenue for the year ended december  by to million and may be dilutive to earnings per share by to 
the company will review the various technology investments in this small business segment as well as other related costs incurred in serving this segment 
choicepoint will also incur incremental expenses as a result of the customer fraud and related events  including approximately million for the three bureau reports and monitoring service for affected consumers identified to date 
the company cannot currently estimate the expense for additional legal  consulting and other operating items relating to these matters 
in addition  the publicity associated with these events or changes in regulation as discussed under this risk factors may materially harm the business and choicepoint s relationship with customers or data suppliers 
the company is involved in several legal proceedings or inquiries that relate to these matters  as described in item legal proceedings of this form k 
choicepoint is unable at this time to predict the outcome of these actions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the financial results  financial condition  and liquidity and on the trading price of the company s common stock 
regardless of the merits and ultimate outcome of these lawsuits and other proceedings  litigation and proceedings of this type are expensive and will require that substantial company resources and executive time is devoted to defend these proceedings 
customers the company has few long term agreements with its customers 
although management believes that the quality of choicepoint s products and services should permit the company to maintain relationships with its customers  there can be no assurance that choicepoint will do so 
any loss of a significant number of major customers would have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position  and results of operations 
choicepoint s customers include federal  state  and local governments 
government business is subject to many unique risks  such as delays in funding  reduction or modification of contracts or subcontracts  failure to exercise options  changes in government policies  and the imposition of budgetary restraints 
a loss of 
table of contents government contract revenues also could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position  and results of operations 
the acquisition or consolidation of the company s customers by another company could decrease the demand for products and services 
after consolidation  these companies may reorganize management responsibilities or strategic and purchasing decisions that could adversely affect demand for choicepoint s products and services 
the company may lose business relationships with key contacts within a customer s organization due to budget cuts  layoffs  or other changes resulting from an acquisition or consolidation 
the consolidation of companies also may alter the technological infrastructure of the combined entity  and choicepoint s products and services may not be compatible with the new technological system 
acquisitions the company s long term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions 
while choicepoint believes it has been successful in implementing this strategy during prior years  there is no certainly that future acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or that acquired assets  data or businesses will be successfully integrated into the company s operations 
any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among other things paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient  timely manner  assuming potential liabilities arising from the products of an acquired company  managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business  distracting management focus from our core business  impairing relationships with employees  customers  and strategic partners  incurring expenses associated with the amortization of other intangibles  incurring expenses associated with a write off of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions  weak economies in certain competitive markets  or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits  or diluting the share value and voting power of existing shareholders 
suppliers choicepoint depends upon third party information suppliers for information used in its databases 
the loss of some data supply sources could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  and results of operations 
the company relies extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non proprietary databases  and its operations depend upon information derived from a wide variety of automated and manual sources 
data is obtained from public filings  information companies  governmental authorities  competitors  and customers 
agreements with data suppliers are generally short term agreements 
some suppliers are also competitors  which may make the company vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements 
choicepoint has no reason to anticipate the termination of any significant relationships with these data suppliers and believe that in most cases substitute suppliers could be arranged if any termination occurred 
however  such a termination could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position  and results of operations if the company was unable to arrange for substitute sources 
choicepoint currently maintains databases that contain information provided and used by insurance underwriters 
the company does not own the information in these databases  and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases 
if this information was withheld  the business  financial position  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents choicepoint uses social security numbers to generate certain reports 
social security numbers could become unavailable in the future because of changes in the law or because data suppliers decide not to supply them 
if this information cannot be obtained in the future  the company would be unable to generate reports as efficiently 
although names  addresses  and dates of birth are used to generate reports  without the use of social security numbers  the company believes that those reports would not be as complete or as accurate as the reports generated with social security numbers 
choicepoint also would incur significant expense to revise the software used to generate reports 
less complete or less accurate reports could adversely affect the business  financial position and results of operations 
choicepoint obtains the credit header data in its databases from consumer credit reporting agencies 
the data consists of names  addresses  social security numbers  and dates of birth 
any of these suppliers could stop supplying this data or could substantially increase their prices 
withholding this data could materially adversely affect the business  financial position and results of operations 
competition the information industry in which the company operates is highly competitive  and is expected to remain highly competitive 
in each of the markets served  choicepoint competes on the basis of price  quality  customer service  product and service selection 
the company s competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment 
due to their size  certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than choicepoint can 
as a result  these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences  emerging technologies and market trends 
in addition  new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away 
the company cannot be sure that it will be able to maintain or strengthen its competitive position in its market segments  especially against larger competitors 
if choicepoint fails to successfully compete  the business  financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 
government regulation and adverse publicity because personal  public and non public information is used to search the company s databases and access the databases of others  choicepoint is vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning these uses 
choicepoint provides many types of data and services which already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act  gramm leach bliley act  drivers privacy protection act  and to a lesser extent  various other federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace 
however  many consumer advocates  privacy advocates  and government regulators believe the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy 
they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information  particularly social security numbers  department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth 
as a result  they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors 
in particular  following publicity surrounding the matters disclosed under illegal data access in item of this report  a number of congressional leaders are calling for hearings and proposing legislative responses in light of increasing concerns over identity theft 
the following legal and regulatory developments could have a material adverse affect on the business  financial position and results of operations amendment  enactment  or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers  changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing  failure of our products and services to comply with current laws and regulations  and failure of our products and services to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient  cost effective manner 

table of contents attracting and retaining qualified personnel the company cannot be certain that it can continue to attract and retain sufficient qualified management  technical  sales  or other personnel necessary to conduct our business successfully 
the resignation  retirement  death or disability of the chief executive officer or chief operating officer and the inability to sufficiently replace either position could adversely affect the business 
during recent years  the company has significantly increased its senior management talent levels 
accordingly  the dependency on the chief executive officer and or the chief operating officer is expected to continue to diminish in future years 
system interruptions system interruptions could delay and disrupt the company s products and services  cause harm to choicepoint s business and reputation and result in a loss of customers 
the company depends heavily upon computer systems  most of which are located in alpharetta  georgia and boca raton  florida  to provide reliable  uninterrupted service 
certain events beyond the company s control  such as fires  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes  power losses and telecommunications failures  could damage computer networks and temporarily or permanently interrupt services to customers 
the systems in boca raton  florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes 
these interruptions also may interfere with suppliers ability to provide data and employees ability to attend work and perform their responsibilities 
choicepoint has attempted to shield its systems from interruptions and failures through disaster recovery planning  and property and business interruption insurance is carried in case these events occur 
however  the system safeguards and insurance still may not adequately protect the company from losses arising from system interruptions 
security breaches and customers misuse of information services security breaches in the company s facilities  computer networks  and databases may cause harm to choicepoint s business and reputation and result in a loss of customers 
many security measures have been instituted to protect the systems and to assure the marketplace that these systems are secure 
however  despite such security measures  the company s systems may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems 
third party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information 
if users gain improper access to choicepoint s databases  they may be able to steal  publish  delete or modify confidential third party information that is stored or transmitted on the networks 
in addition  misuse by customers of choicepoint s information services could cause harm to the business and reputation and result in loss of customers 
on september   the company found evidence of suspicious activity by a few small business customers in the los angeles area 
this recent fraud incident and related matters are discussed under illegal data access in item of this report 
there have been other instances in which subpoenas and other inquiries have been received from law enforcement regarding activities of choicepoint customers which sometimes related to potentially improper use of the company s information services 
the company is aware of a limited number of past instances that resulted in criminal convictions of certain former customers for activities involving improper use of certain information services 
a security or privacy breach may affect choicepoint in the following ways deterring customers from using choicepoint s products and services  deterring data suppliers from supplying data to the company  harming the company s reputation  exposing choicepoint to liability  increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach  affecting the company s ability to meet customers expectations  or causing inquiry from governmental authorities 

table of contents economy the current general economic downturn could continue to result in a reduced demand for choicepoint s products and services 
revenues are dependent to a certain extent upon general economic conditions and upon conditions in the industries served by choicepoint 
certain revenues are derived from pre employment screening services 
the revenue growth and profitability of the business depends on the overall demand for existing and new products 
a softening of demand for information services caused by a weakening of the economy generally may result in decreased revenues or lower growth rates 
the company cannot be certain that future revenues  results of operations  cash flows and profitability will not fluctuate on a quarterly or annual basis or that it will be able to refinance our existing credit facility or receivables facility 
direct marketing direct marketing products and services could be vulnerable to the following risks development of other methods of sales and advertising that are more effective than direct marketing  changes in laws and regulations relating to data privacy  in particular  telephone solicitation and email privacy  increases in postal rates or disruption in the availability of postal services that could increase the cost of direct mail production and processing and reduce demand for information among our direct mail customers  and loss of use or data by third parties 
new products  services  and technologies the company s growth partially depends on the ability to develop and market new products  services and technologies 
choicepoint has focused on developing growth opportunities in a number of potential markets 
no assurance can be given that choicepoint will be successful in developing new products  services and technologies or that these products  services and technologies will gain market acceptance or generate significant revenue 
the company s initiatives are in various stages of development and may be subject to delays in implementation  customer dissatisfaction with product or service performance or other significant undetected problems 
if the company fails to successfully introduce new initiatives  the business  financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 
litigation in addition to the legal proceedings specifically described under item of this report  choicepoint and its subsidiaries are also involved in various legal proceedings that periodically arise during the course of business 
while the company does not have reason to believe that the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  litigation is essentially unpredictable and excessive verdicts could occur 
although we believe we have valid defenses in these matters  in the future we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates
