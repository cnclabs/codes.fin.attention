in addition to the specific development and expansion projects discussed in regional results and development plans  we perform on going refurbishment and maintenance at our casino entertainment facilities to maintain our quality standards 
we also continue to pursue development and acquisition opportunities for additional casino entertainment facilities that meet our strategic and return on investment criteria 
prior to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals  the costs of pursuing development projects are expensed as incurred 
construction related costs incurred after the receipt of necessary approvals are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the resulting asset 
project opening costs are expensed as incurred 
our capital spending for totaled approximately million  excluding the cost of our acquisition of horseshoe gaming  the intangible assets from horseshoe club and the purchase of partnership interests 
capital spending was approximately million and capital spending was million  excluding the costs of our acquisitions of louisiana downs and the remaining interest in jcc 
estimated total capital expenditures for are expected to be between million and million and do not include estimated expenditures for our announced acquisition of caesars or for unidentified development opportunities 
our planned development projects  if they go forward  will require  individually and in the aggregate  significant capital commitments and  if completed  may result in significant additional revenues 
the commitment of capital  the timing of completion and the commencement of operations of casino entertainment development projects are contingent upon  among other things  negotiation of final agreements and receipt of approvals from the appropriate political and regulatory bodies 
cash needed to finance the caesars acquisition and projects currently under development as well as additional projects being pursued is expected to be made available from operating cash flows  established debt programs see debt and liquidity  joint venture partners  specific project financing  guarantees of third party debt and additional debt and or equity offerings 
debt and liquidity we generate substantial cash flows from operating activities  as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
these cash flows reflect the impact on our consolidated operations of the success of our marketing programs  our strategic acquisitions  on going cost containment focus and favorable variable interest rates 
for  we reported cash flows from operating activities of million  a increase over the million reported in the amount reflected a increase over the level 
we use the cash flows generated by the company to fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects  to pursue additional growth opportunities via strategic acquisitions of existing companies and new development opportunities and to return capital to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchase programs and dividends 
when necessary  we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with funds provided by financing activities to balance our cash requirements

in addition  we may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or growth or to refinance existing debt 
we continue to review additional opportunities to acquire or invest in companies  properties and other investments that meet our strategic and return on investment criteria 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change significantly in future periods 
the majority of our debt is due in december and beyond 
payments of short term debt obligations and other commitments are expected to be made from operating cash flows 
long term obligations are expected to be paid through operating cash flows  refinancing of debt  joint venture partners or  if necessary  additional debt and or equity offerings 
with the planned acquisition of caesars  we will assume approximately billion of caesars outstanding debt and incur approximately billion in debt to fund the acquisition 
we plan to secure the funds for the acquisition by borrowing under our amended credit agreement see credit agreement below 
credit agreement at december   we had credit facilities the credit agreement that provided for up to billion in borrowings  maturing on april  the credit agreement contains a provision that would allow an increase in the borrowing capacity to billion  if mutually acceptable to the company and the lenders 
interest on the credit agreement is based on our debt ratings and leverage ratio and is subject to change 
as of december   the credit agreement bore interest based upon basis points over libor and bore a facility fee for borrowed and unborrowed amounts of basis points  a combined basis points 
at our option  we may borrow at the prime rate under the credit agreement 
as of december   billion in borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement with an additional million committed to back letters of credit 
after consideration of these borrowings  but before consideration of amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program  million of additional borrowing capacity was available to the company as of december  in january  an agreement was reached to amend the credit agreement  which will increase our borrowing capacity from billion to billion 
the amendment also contains a provision that will allow a further increase in the borrowing capacity to billion  if mutually acceptable to the company and the lenders  and lowers the interest rate from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
the amended agreement becomes effective upon the satisfaction of various closing conditions  including the closing of our acquisition of caesars 
other significant terms and conditions of the credit agreement  including the maturity date of april  did not change 
derivative instruments we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and all amendments thereto 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement or in other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting  the type of hedge transaction and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes 
such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts 
our derivative instruments contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are limited to major banks and financial institutions  and we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
interest rate swaps we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments 
as of december   we were a party to four interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of million 
these interest rate swaps serve to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments by effectively converting fixed rates associated with long term debt obligations to floating rates 
the differences to be paid or received under the terms of interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense for the related debt 
changes in the variable interest rates to be paid or received pursuant to the terms of interest rate swap agreements will have a corresponding effect on future cash flows 
the major terms of the interest rate swaps are as follows 
swap effective date notional amount fixed rate received variable rate paid as of dec 
 next reset date swap expiration date in millions dec 
 june  dec

 the company s interest rate swaps qualify for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
the net effect of the above swaps reduced our interest expense by million 
the effect of the swaps to interest expense was immaterial 
treasury rate lock agreements we expect to issue between million and billion of new debt in the first half of to partially hedge the risk of future increases to the treasury rate  we have entered into agreements to lock in existing ten year rates to hedge against such increases 
the major terms of the treasury rate lock agreements are as follows 
effective date type of hedge treasury lock rate notional amount termination date in millions nov 
 cash flow may  dec

 cash flow may  the company has determined that the treasury rate lock agreements qualify for hedge accounting and are perfectly effective 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
the fair values of our treasury rate lock agreements are carried as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  and changes in the fair values are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to earnings over the life of the debt to be issued 
in january  we hedged an additional million notional amount with terms identical to the treasury locks existing as of december   at a rate of and a termination date of may  commercial paper to provide the company with cost effective borrowing flexibility  we have a million commercial paper program that is used to borrow funds for general corporate purposes 
although the debt instruments are short term in tenor  they are classified as long term debt because the commercial paper is backed by our credit agreement and we have committed to keep available capacity under our credit agreement in an amount equal to or greater than amounts borrowed under this program 
at december   million was outstanding under this program 
issuance of new debt in addition to our credit agreement  we have issued debt and entered into credit agreements to provide the company with cost effective borrowing flexibility and to replace short term  floating rate debt with long term  fixed rate debt 
the table below summarizes the face value of debt obligations entered into during the last three years and outstanding at december  debt issued matures face value outstanding at december  in millions commercial paper senior notes june senior notes december subsequent to the end of  we issued million of senior floating rate notes due in in a rule a private placement 
we agreed to  upon the request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the senior floating rate notes then outstanding  to exchange the private placement offering with fully registered senior floating rate notes 
if the exchange offer does not provide the holders of the senior floating rate notes freely transferable securities  we may be required to file a shelf registration statement that would allow them to resell the senior floating rate notes in the open market  subject to certain restrictions 
extinguishments of debt funds from the new debt discussed above  as well as proceeds from our credit agreement  were used to retire certain of our outstanding debt  in particular those debt obligations assumed in our acquisition transactions  to reduce our effective interest rate and or lengthen maturities 
the following table summarizes the debt obligations  in addition to our previous credit and letter of credit facilities that we have retired over the last three years issuer date retired debt extinguished face value retired in millions horseshoe gaming august senior subordinated notes due harrah s operating co december senior subordinated notes due harrah s operating co august senior subordinated notes due jcc december senior notes due in july  our board of directors authorized the company to retire  from time to time through cash purchases  portions of our outstanding debt in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these repurchases will be funded through available cash from operations and borrowings from our established debt programs 
such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
as of december   million of our senior subordinated notes had been retired under this authorization 
charges of million representing premiums paid and write offs of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of portions of our senior subordinated notes and of our previous credit and letter of credit facilities were recorded in in compliance with sfas no 
 these charges no longer qualify for presentation as extraordinary items and are  therefore  included in income from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of income 
subsequent to the end of  we retired an additional million of our senior subordinated notes due in december the loss on the early extinguishment of this debt  expected to be million  will be reported in our first quarter results 
equity repurchase programs during the past four years  our board of directors has authorized plans whereby we have purchased shares of the company s common stock in the open market from time to time as market conditions and other factors warranted 
the table below summarizes the plans in effect during the last four years 
plan authorized number of shares authorized number of shares purchased as of december  average price per share july million million july million million november million million november million n a in november  our board of directors authorized the purchase of million shares of common stock in the open market and negotiated purchases through the end of the million shares includes million shares available to be purchased pursuant to the authorization that was to expire december   plus an additional million shares 
the repurchases were funded through available operating cash flows and borrowings from our established debt programs 
guarantees of third party debt and other obligations and commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in millions debt    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase orders obligations guaranteed payments to state of louisiana community reinvestment construction commitments other contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commitments total amounts committed less than year years years after years in millions guarantees of loans letters of credit minimum payments to tribes the agreements pursuant to which we manage casinos on indian lands contain provisions required by law that provide that a minimum monthly payment be made to the tribe 
that obligation has priority over scheduled repayments of borrowings for development costs and over the management fee earned and paid to the manager 
in the event that insufficient cash flow is generated by the operations to fund this payment  we must pay the shortfall to the tribe 
subject to certain limitations as to time  such advances  if any  would be repaid to us in future periods in which operations generate cash flow in excess of the required minimum payment 
these commitments will terminate upon the occurrence of certain defined events  including termination of the management contract 
our aggregate monthly commitment for the minimum guaranteed payments pursuant to the contracts for the four managed indian owned facilities now open  which extend for periods of up to months from december   is million 
each of these casinos currently generates sufficient cash flows to cover all of their obligations  including their debt service 
we may guarantee all or part of the debt incurred by indian tribes with which we have entered a management contract to fund development of casinos on the indian lands 
for all existing guarantees of indian debt  we have obtained a first lien on certain personal property tangible and intangible of the casino enterprise 
there can be no assurance  however  that the value of such property would satisfy our obligations in the event these guarantees were enforced 
additionally  we have received limited waivers from the indian tribes of their sovereign immunity to allow us to pursue our rights under the contracts between the parties and to enforce collection efforts as to any assets in which a security interest is taken 
the aggregate outstanding balance of such debt as of december   was million 
some of our guarantees of the debt for casinos on indian lands were modified during  triggering the requirement under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to recognize a liability for the estimated fair value of those guarantees 
liabilities  representing the fair value of our guarantees  and corresponding assets  representing the portion of our management fee receivable attributable to our agreements to provide the related guarantees  were recorded and are being amortized over the lives of the related agreements 
we estimate the fair value of the obligation by considering what premium would have been required by us or by an unrelated party 
the amounts recognized represent the present value of the premium in interest rates and fees that would have been charged to the tribes if we had not provided the guarantees 
the balance of the liability for the guarantees and of the related assets at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
overall operating results on september   we reached an agreement to sell the assets and certain related current liabilities of harrah s east chicago and harrah s tunica to another gaming company 
the sale  which is subject to regulatory approvals  is expected to close in the first quarter of we present these properties in assets liabilities held for sale and as part of our discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of the net assets of these properties at december   is million  and they contributed million  net of taxes of million  to our net income 
we ceased depreciation of their assets in september had we not ceased depreciation of these assets  additional depreciation expense of million would have been recorded 
we expect to report a gain on the sale of these two properties in the quarter in which the transaction closes 
the discussion that follows is related to our continuing operations 
percentage increase decrease in millions  except earnings per share vs vs casino revenues    total revenues    income from operations income from continuing operations net income earnings per share diluted from continuing operations net income operating margin pt pts in  total revenues increased for the seventh consecutive year and were higher than in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of horseshoe gaming on july   strong results from our properties in southern nevada and organic growth at most of our properties 
we define organic growth as year over year increase in gaming revenues for properties that we have owned for both periods 
our income from operations was higher than in  driven by the increased revenues and lower gaming taxes at our bluffs run property as a result of legislation that settled an issue related to gaming taxes for casinos at racetracks 
net income increased and diluted earnings per share increased over our results 
regional results and development plans the executive decision makers of our company review operating results  assess performance and make decisions related to the allocation of resources on a property by property basis 
we  therefore  believe that each property is an operating segment and that it is appropriate to aggregate and present the operations of our company as one reportable segment 
in order to provide more detail in a more understandable manner than would be possible on a consolidated basis  our properties have been grouped as follows to facilitate discussion of our operating results west east north central south central managed harrah s reno harrah s harveys lake tahoe bill s harrah s las vegas rio harrah s laughlin las vegas horseshoe harrah s atlantic city showboat atlantic city harrah s joliet harrah s north kansas city harrah s council bluffs bluffs run harrah s st

for and  discontinued operations also included the results of properties in vicksburg  mississippi and central city  colorado  both of which were sold in west results percentage increase decrease in millions vs vs casino revenues  total revenues    income from operations operating margin pts pts southern nevada our west properties posted record revenues and income from operations in  driven by results from our southern nevada properties where strong cross market play at  and cross property play between  harrah s las vegas and the rio  room pricing trends in las vegas  record revenues at harrah s laughlin and revenues from las vegas horseshoe  which opened on april   helped southern nevada revenues increase by over levels 
we define cross market play as gaming by customers at harrah s entertainment properties other than their home casino 
income from operations for our southern nevada properties was higher than in as a result of the higher revenues and improved operating margins 
construction began in second quarter on a  square foot expansion of the rio pavilion and convention center in las vegas 
the approximate million expansion will increase the overall size of the rio s convention center to  square feet and is scheduled for completion in mid as of december   million had been spent on this project 
in  strong cross market and retail play  effective marketing and air charter programs and effective cost control measures drove record revenues and income from operations in southern nevada 
we define retail play as total rewards customers who typically spend up to per visit 
revenues at our southern nevada properties were higher than in  and income from operations was up over northern nevada revenues from our northern nevada properties were higher than in  and income from operations was higher than last year 
with the expectation of continued expansion of indian gaming in california  we believe that achieving growth at our northern nevada properties  particularly in reno  will be a challenge 
in  northern nevada revenues were higher than in  but income from operations was down 
our northern nevada properties faced the challenge of increased competition from indian casinos in california and weak retail and unrated play play by customers without a total rewards card 
increased utilization of air charter programs and targeted marketing programs helped maintain revenues  but the costs of these programs resulted in some margin erosion 
in our annual assessment of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets  we determined that the remaining goodwill associated with our reno property was impaired 
a charge of approximately million  representing the remaining unamortized goodwill at reno  was taken in the fourth quarter of for this impairment 
east results percentage increase decrease in millions vs vs casino revenues total revenues income from operations operating margin pts pt revenues at our east properties were level with and income from operations was down by from last year 
showboat s revenues and income from operations  which were and  respectively  higher than in  were aided by a new hotel tower that opened in second quarter and slot machines that were added in third quarter harrah s atlantic city s revenues and income from operations were and  respectively  lower than in harrah s atlantic city has been more directly affected than showboat by the new competitor in the atlantic city market  but marketing programs to address the aggressive customer acquisition campaign of the new competitor are having some success 
in addition  results at both of our atlantic city properties were impacted by a month long union strike during fourth quarter construction began in fourth quarter on a house of blues club at our showboat property in atlantic city 
this approximate million project will add a range of amenities to the property  including a concert hall  nightclub and restaurant  and a private member foundation room 
the project is scheduled for completion in late june as of december   million had been spent on this project 
in  contributions from recent investments at our atlantic city properties and execution of a highly targeted marketing program helped offset the impact of a new competitor in the atlantic city market 
at showboat atlantic city  where a new hotel tower opened in second quarter and slot machines were added in third quarter  revenues were up and income from operations was higher than in harrah s atlantic city s revenues and income from operations declined and  respectively  from levels  as that property was more affected by the opening of the first new competitor in atlantic city in more than a decade 
an additional slot machines were added at this property in december north central results percentage increase decrease in millions vs vs casino revenues    total revenues    income from operations operating margin pts pts an agreement has been reached to sell harrah s east chicago  therefore  this property is no longer included in our north central grouping 
results of harrah s east chicago have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in  the increases in revenues and income from operations at our north central properties were driven by the acquisition of horseshoe hammond on july   and lower gaming taxes at our bluffs run property as a result of legislation that settled an issue related to gaming taxes for casinos at racetracks 
in  higher gaming taxes and competitive pressures led to declines from revenues and income from operations at our north central properties 
chicagoland illinois combined revenues for were higher than combined revenues for  and combined income from operations was higher than last year due to results from horseshoe hammond subsequent to its acquisition 
excluding results of horseshoe hammond  combined revenues were up and income from operations was down from last year as a result of increases in state gaming taxes  admission taxes and increased marketing costs 
combined revenues and income from operations at our chicagoland illinois properties were and  respectively  below higher gaming and admission taxes  heightened competition and winter storms during the first quarter of were responsible for the declines 
new tax legislation in illinois in raised the maximum gaming tax rate to and impacted our income from operations by million in in order to sustain profitability under the higher tax scheme  operational changes were implemented at joliet in the third quarter  and revenues declined as a result of these changes 
missouri revenues at our missouri properties were higher than in  due to higher revenues at our st 
louis property  but income from operations was below last year 
gains at our st 
louis property  driven by recent capital investments including a new hotel tower  our total rewards program and improvements made to the slot floor  were more than offset by declines at our north kansas city property where recent capital improvements by two competitors impacted results 
construction was completed in third quarter on an million expansion of harrah s st 
louis  which included a second hotel tower  redesign of the hotel lobby  new valet parking areas  the addition of parking garage express ramps and the expansion of two restaurants and other amenities 
a million expansion and property enhancement project at harrah s north kansas city broke ground in second quarter this project  which will add a room hotel addition  new restaurants and other amenities  is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of as of december   million had been spent on this project 
in  combined revenues for our missouri properties declined from and income from operations was down due primarily to heightened competition in both the st 
louis and north kansas city markets 
harrah s st 
louis rebound from the increased competition began in fourth quarter  driven by our total rewards program and improvements made to the slot floor 
in the kansas city market  a competitor opened its expanded facility in third quarter and another competitor opened its new barge facility in fourth quarter iowa revenues for our iowa properties were higher than in  and income from operations more than doubled due to lower gaming taxes in following the resolution of the gaming tax rate issues discussed below 
casinos at racetracks in iowa historically had been taxed at a higher rate in than the casinos on riverboats operating in iowa 
the iowa supreme court issued an opinion in june that this disparity was unconstitutional 
the state appealed the iowa supreme court s decision to the united states supreme court and in june  the united states supreme court overturned the ruling and remanded the case back to the iowa supreme court for further consideration 
in february  the iowa supreme court ruled that the disparity violates the iowa constitution  a ruling the state appealed to the united states supreme court in april the united states supreme court has declined to hear this case 
in april  the iowa legislature passed legislation to effectively settle the issues regarding the gaming tax rates 
the new legislation provides for a tax rate of for both riverboats and racetracks effective july  however  racetracks have the option to conduct table games and video games that simulate table games by paying a million fee to the state and a gaming tax rate of 
of the million fee could be used to offset wagering taxes for each of the five fiscal years beginning july  we plan to add table games to the bluffs run facility in conjunction with the rebranding  renovation and expansion of that facility see discussion below 
also  for the period july   to june   racetracks had to make a lump sum non refundable payment to the state to enable the state to receive a total amount of taxes for that period based on a tax rate 
bluffs run paid approximately million for this lump sum payment 
during that period we had paid taxes at the rate for bluffs run  following the state s instructions 
however  given the uncertainty of this situation  we continued to accrue gaming taxes at the higher rate between and and accrued approximately million  after consideration of the lump sum payment  in state gaming taxes that we did not have to pay 
accruals related to iowa gaming taxes were adjusted in second quarter  with million  representing the adjustment for first quarter  credited to the property s income from operations and million  representing the adjustment for prior periods  credited to write downs  reserves and recoveries 
in accordance with previous agreements and as additional purchase price consideration  a payment of approximately million was made to iowa west racing association iowa west  the entity holding the pari mutuel and gaming license for the bluffs run casino and with whom we have a management agreement to operate that property 
the additional payment to iowa west increased goodwill attributed to the bluffs run property 
the payment to iowa west assumed we will operate table games at bluffs run and pay a tax rate  however  iowa west has taken the position that the purchase price adjustment should be based on a tax rate of  which would result in an additional million payment to iowa west 
if an additional payment is required  it will increase goodwill attributed to this property 
we anticipate that the issue will be resolved by arbitration during in fourth quarter  we announced plans to rebrand the bluffs run casino under the horseshoe brand as part of an million renovation and expansion of that property 
the property s greyhound racetrack will remain in operation and retain the bluffs run brand 
construction began in february with completion scheduled for the first quarter of combined revenues from our iowa properties were above revenues  but income from operations was below due  in part  to higher gaming taxes at our bluffs run property  where gaming taxes increased in accordance with a predetermined rate increase 
south central results percentage increase decrease in millions vs vs casino revenues total revenues income from operations operating margin pt pts an agreement has been reached to sell harrah s tunica  therefore  this property is no longer included in our south central grouping 
results of harrah s tunica have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
combined revenues and income from operations were higher by and  respectively  than in due to results from horseshoe bossier city and horseshoe tunica subsequent to their july   acquisition and increased revenues from louisiana downs  harrah s new orleans and harrah s lake charles and partially offset by the loss of revenues in due to the sale of harrah s shreveport 
the permanent facility at louisiana downs opened in second quarter with  slot machines 
slot machines had been in service since second quarter at louisiana downs 
combined revenues at our south central properties were up and combined income from operations was up  driven by a full year of consolidation of new orleans results subsequent to the acquisition of a controlling interest in that property in early june and results from louisiana downs  which was acquired in december harrah s new orleans contributed million in revenues and million in income from operations in compared to million in revenues and million in income from operations subsequent to its consolidation in the opening of an expanded buffet and new steakhouse at harrah s new orleans in attracted new business to that property 
prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest in that property  we had limited ability to invest in amenities  and we are now actively pursuing such opportunities 
construction began in second quarter on a story  room  million hotel tower at harrah s new orleans 
the property does not currently operate a hotel  although it does utilize rooms at third party hotels 
the hotel is expected to open in the first quarter of million had been spent on this project as of december  on december   we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in louisiana downs  a thoroughbred racetrack in bossier city  louisiana  and in may  slot machines were placed in service there 
construction was completed during second quarter on phase ii of the expansion of louisiana downs  which included a new  permanent facility with approximately  slot machines 
our renovation and expansion of louisiana downs cost approximately million 
louisiana downs contributed million in revenues in  but preopening costs related to the introduction of slot machines at the facility drove a loss from operations of million 
our lake charles property has faced increasing competition over the last several years  including the addition of slot machines at a racetrack located closer than our property to one of our texas feeder markets and additional indian casino offerings 
approximately million of goodwill is allocated to the lake charles property 
the operating results for the property did improve in over the prior year  however  a new competitor is expected to open in the lake charles market in mid should the opening of the new competitor negatively impact operating results at our lake charles property  it could impact the analysis for the impairment of goodwill for that operating unit 
due to a decision to sell harrah s shreveport  which was completed in second quarter  we classified that property in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and ceased depreciating its assets 
since the horseshoe gaming acquisition gave us a continued presence in the shreveport bossier city market  harrah s shreveport s operating results were not classified as discontinued operations 
no gain or loss was recorded on this sale 
on june   we announced an agreement to sell harrah s vicksburg and that sale was completed on october  results for harrah s vicksburg were presented as discontinued operations and results for were reclassified to conform to the presentation 
a loss of million  net of tax  resulted from this sale

we recently suspended operation of luckyme  our on line gaming initiative in the united kingdom 
no material charges were recorded as a result of this action 
losses related to luckyme were approximately million for revenues from our managed properties were higher in than in the previous year due to a full year of management fees from harrah s rincon casino and resort  owned by the rincon san luiseno band of mission indians rincon in southern california  which opened in august the increased fees from rincon were partially offset by changes in fee structures provided by extended management agreements and by the elimination of management fees from harrah s new orleans subsequent to its consolidation with our financial results in june construction began in january on a million expansion of harrah s cherokee smoky mountains casino in cherokee  north carolina  that will add a story hotel tower with approximately rooms  which is scheduled for completion in second quarter a room hotel and  square foot conference center opened at that property in second quarter  and in fourth quarter  an expansion project was completed that added approximately  square feet of casino space

write downs  reserves and recoveries include various pretax charges to record asset impairments  contingent liabilities reserves  project write offs  demolition costs and recoveries at time of sale and of previously recorded reserves and other nonroutine transactions 
in  we began tracking demolition costs separate from project opening costs 
the components of write downs  reserves and recoveries were as follows in millions contribution to the harrah s foundation demolition costs write off of abandoned assets and other costs settlement of litigation termination of contracts reversal of prior year iowa gaming tax accrual impairment of goodwill impairment of long lived assets settlement of sales tax contingency charge for structural repairs at reno recoveries from previously impaired assets and reserved amounts project opening costs for each of the three years presented include costs incurred in connection with the integration of acquired properties into harrah s entertainment s systems and technology and costs incurred in connection with expansion and renovation projects at various properties 
corporate expense increased in from  primarily due to higher incentive compensation plan expenses  on going costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance and increased depreciation expense 
merger and integration costs for the caesars acquisition include costs for consultants and dedicated internal resources to plan for the merger and integration of caesars into harrah s entertainment 
amortization of intangible assets increased in due to amortization of intangible assets acquired from horseshoe gaming on july   based on the preliminary purchase price allocation for that acquisition 
interest expense was higher in than in due to additional debt related to our acquisition of horseshoe gaming on july  for our fixed rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements  the average interest rate received was 
the average interest rate on our variable rate debt  excluding the impact of our swap agreements  was at december   compared to at december  a change in interest rates will impact our financial results 
for example  assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical change in corresponding interest rates would change interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
our variable rate debt  including million of fixed rate debt for which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  represents approximately of our total debt  while our fixed rate debt is approximately of our total debt

effects of current economic and political conditions competitive pressures due to the limited number of new markets opening for development in recent years  many casino operators are reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers  thereby increasing competition in those markets 
as companies have completed expansion projects  supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets and competition has increased significantly 
furthermore  several operators  including harrah s entertainment  have announced plans for additional developments or expansions in some markets 
the louisiana legislature has authorized the use of slot machines at horse racing tracks in four parishes in louisiana 
we operate casinos in three of these markets 
in first quarter  a horse racing facility  located in one of those parishes where the use of slot machines has been authorized and near our property in lake charles  louisiana  opened with approximately  machines 
the horse racing facility is approximately miles closer to one of our major feeder markets than our property 
revenues and income from operations at our lake charles property have been negatively impacted by the addition of this new competitor 
in fourth quarter  we acquired a controlling interest in louisiana downs  a thoroughbred racetrack in bossier city  louisiana  which is in another of the parishes where the use of slot machines has been authorized 
in orleans parish  where harrah s new orleans is located  voters approved the use of slot machines at a racetrack in october in the third quarter of  the state of louisiana selected a competitor to receive the fifteenth and final riverboat gaming license to be issued by the state  under the legislation legalizing riverboat gaming in that state 
the competitor s project is for a riverboat casino in lake charles 
construction of that facility began in september  and it is anticipated to open by mid we believe that the new riverboat competition in the lake charles area will have a negative impact on our operations there 
in atlantic city  a competitor opened a  room hotel and casino in july and in  announced plans to expand gaming and nongaming amenities  including a new hotel tower  at that property 
a competitor in missouri completed a large casino expansion in third quarter that is located near our st 
louis property  a competitor in the joliet market completed a new barge facility in second quarter and another competitor in the chicagoland market replaced its boats with barges in second quarter in the kansas city market  a competitor opened its expanded facility in third quarter and another competitor opened its new barge facility in fourth quarter the short term impact of increased competition in these markets has been negative 
a competitor is scheduled to open a new property in las vegas in the second quarter of  which could impact our properties there 
in october  the legislature of the state of new york approved a bill authorizing six new tribal casinos in that state and video lottery terminals at tracks 
the measure allows the governor of new york to negotiate gaming compacts with american indian tribes to operate three casinos in the catskills and three casinos in western new york 
in september  the state of california and approximately indian tribes executed class iii gaming compacts  which other california tribes can join 
the compacts will allow each tribe to operate  on tribal trust lands  two casinos with up to  slot machines per tribe and unlimited house banked card games 
our own agreements with rincon are a result of these events see regional results and development plans  managed casinos and other 
other states are also considering legislation enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino like operations 
although the short term effect of such competitive developments on our company generally has been negative  we are not able to determine the long term impact  whether favorable or unfavorable  that these trends and events will have on current or future markets 
we believe that the geographic diversity of our operations  our focus on multi market customer relationships  our service training  our rewards and customer loyalty programs  and our continuing efforts to establish our brands as premier brands upon which we have built strong customer loyalty have well positioned us to face the challenges present within our industry 
we utilize the capabilities of winet  a sophisticated nationwide customer database  and total rewards  a nationwide loyalty program that allows our customers to earn cash  comps and other benefits for playing at harrah s entertainment casinos 
we believe these sophisticated marketing tools provide us with competitive advantages  particularly with players who visit more than one market 
political uncertainties the casino entertainment industry is subject to political and regulatory uncertainty 
from time to time  individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums  which could adversely impact our operations 
the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation and referendums in the future cannot be predicted 
the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  which would affect the industry 
it is not possible to determine the scope or likelihood of possible future changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws 
if adopted  such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
addition of international operations the planned acquisition of caesars will include certain properties located in countries outside the united states 
international operations are subject to inherent risks including variation in local economies  currency fluctuation  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  trade barriers  burden of complying with a variety of international laws and political and economic instability 
in addition  caesars has announced plans to develop and operate a casino in the united kingdom  partnering with quintain estates and development group 
development in the united kingdom is dependent on passage of proposed legislative reform in the united kingdom gaming laws and regulations and on receipt of a gaming license 
economic conditions historically  economic conditions have had little effect on our operations  but we believe that adverse economic conditions could affect future results 
we feel that our marketing programs  use of our technology to change the mix of slot machines and table games and our cost management programs have helped  in the past  to offset the impact of a sluggish economy 
national defense and homeland security matters the september   terrorist attacks  the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
for example  the united states coast guard is considering regulations designed to increase homeland security  which  if passed  could affect some of our properties and require significant expenditures to bring such properties into compliance 
furthermore  given current conditions in the global insurance markets  we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the estimated lives assigned to our assets  the determination of bad debt  asset impairment  fair value of self insurance reserves and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be those in which our policies  estimates and judgments have a significant impact on issues that are inherently uncertain 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the operating unit level  which for most of our assets is the individual casino 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have approximately billion in goodwill and other intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets resulting from our acquisition of other businesses 
the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we determine the estimated fair values based on independent appraisals  discounted cash flows  quoted market prices and estimates made by management 
to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets aquired  such excess is allocated to goodwill 
an accounting standard adopted in requires a review at least annually of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets for impairment 
we completed our initial assessment for impairment of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets and recorded an impairment charge in first quarter we complete our annual assessment for impairment in fourth quarter each year  and in fourth quarter  we determined that  except for the goodwill associated with harrah s reno  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives have not been impaired 
a charge was recorded in fourth quarter for the impairment of reno s remaining goodwill 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
total rewards point liability program our customer rewards program  total rewards  offers incentives to customers who gamble at our casinos throughout the united states 
prior to  customers received cash back and other offers made in the form of coupons that were mailed to the customer and were redeemable on a subsequent visit to one of our properties 
the coupons generally expired days after they were issued 
given the requirement of a return visit to redeem the offer and the short term expiration date  with no ability to renew or extend the offer  we recognized the expense of these offers when the coupons were redeemed 
in fourth quarter  a decision was made to change our total rewards program in to give our customers greater flexibility and control over the rewards they receive for playing at our casinos 
under the new program  customers are able to accumulate  or bank  reward credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance will be forfeited if the customer does not earn a reward credit over the prior six month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward credits under the revised program  our accounting for the total rewards program changed and we accrue the expense of reward credits  after consideration of estimated breakage  as they are earned 
to implement this change in the program  an initial bank of reward credits was offered to our existing customers 
the amount of credits offered for this initial bank was calculated based upon tracked play at our casinos 
as a result of the decision to extend this initial offer  an accrual of million was recorded in to recognize our estimate of the expense of this implementation offer 
under the current program  the value of the cost to provide reward credits is expensed as the reward credits are earned 
to arrive at the estimated cost associated with reward credits  estimates and assumptions are made regarding incremental marginal costs of the benefits  breakage rates and the mix of goods and services for which reward credits will be redeemed 
we use historical data to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was accrued for the cost of anticipated total rewards credit redemptions 
the company is planning to integrate the properties acquired from horseshoe gaming in into our total rewards program during our horseshoe properties have a customer rewards program in which customers earn points based on their play 
these points are primarily redeemable for cash and expire after one year 
the liability related to the outstanding points  which is based on historical redemption activity  was million at december  bad debt reserves we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected 
methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables 
historical collection rates are considered  as are customer relationships  in determining specific reserves 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in our bad debt reserve 
as with many estimates  management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts 
self insurance accruals we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with general liability  workers compensation and employee health coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  we had total self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets of million and million  respectively 
in estimating these costs  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we also rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
these claims are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the undiscounted claims  including those claims incurred but not reported 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
we continually monitor the potential for changes in estimates  evaluate our insurance accruals and adjust our recorded provisions 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or income tax returns 
the effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we are unaware of any circumstances that would cause the deferred tax assets to not be realizable  except as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements where the company has provided a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and other deferred state tax assets 
although the company consistently generates taxable income on a consolidated basis  these assets were not deemed realizable because they are attributable to subsidiaries that are not expected to produce future taxable earnings 
additionally  certain of the company s prior year returns are under exam by the internal revenue service as well as other taxing authorities 
in the event that the taxing authorities ultimately sustain adjustments to the company s previously reported taxable income  the company will remit payments accordingly 
although the additional tax payments coupled with the expiration of bonus depreciation provisions in could cause total payments to exceed the reported amount of income tax expense  we do not expect these items to have a material impact on the company s liquidity 
recently issued and proposed accounting standards the following are accounting standards adopted or issued in that could have an impact to our company 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises where equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards 
these entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
companies were required to apply the provisions of fin prospectively for all variable interest entities created after january  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin to clarify some of the provisions of the original interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
the additional guidance explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
application of revised fin was required for public companies with interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application for public entities for all other types of entities was required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
public companies other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  sfas no 
r requires that we recognize an expense for our equity based compensation programs  including stock options 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
r to determine its impact on our future financial statements 
risk factors relating to our business the company is subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies  the enforcement of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty 
regulatory authorities at the us federal  state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any one of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums  which could adversely impact our operations 
the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation and referendums in the future cannot be predicted 
the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  including increases in tax rates  which would affect the industry 
if adopted  such changes could adversely impact harrah s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the development and construction of new hotels  casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones are susceptible to delays  cost overruns and other uncertainties  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may decide to develop  construct and open new hotels  casinos and other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise 
if the caesars merger is consummated  we will also continue to develop the projects that are currently being undertaken by caesars 
future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments and could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  guarantees of third party debt  the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets  which could have an adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the development and construction of new hotels  casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones are susceptible to various risks and uncertainties  such as the existence of acceptable market conditions and demand for the completed project  general construction risks  including cost overruns  change orders and plan or specification modification  shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  labor disputes  unforeseen environmental  engineering or geological problems  work stoppages  fire and other natural disasters  construction scheduling problems and weather interferences  changes and concessions required by governmental or regulatory authorities  delays in obtaining  or inability to obtain  all licenses  permits and authorizations required to complete the project  and disruption of our existing operations and facilities 
our failure to complete any new development or expansion project as planned  on schedule  within budget or in a manner that generates anticipated profits  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash  and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
harrah s entertainment  inc is a holding company and harrah s operating company conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
as a result  our ability to meet our debt service obligations substantially depends upon our subsidiaries cash flow and payments of funds to us by our subsidiaries 
this ability  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
an economic downturn in a region in which we operate  or will operate after the merger  may adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
based on harrah s entertainment s current level of operations and recent acquisitions  including the pending acquisition of caesars  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurances  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
acts of terrorism and war may negatively impact the company s future profits 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties 
we cannot predict the extent to which terrorism  security alerts or war  or hostilities in iraq will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results 
for example  the united states coast guard is considering regulations designed to increase homeland security  which  if passed  could affect some of our properties and require significant expenditures to bring such properties into compliance 
in addition  as a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future  premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased  and some types of insurance are no longer available 
given current conditions in the global insurance markets  we are predominately uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
if any such event were to affect our properties  we would likely be adversely impacted 
work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact the company s future profits 
some of our employees are represented by labor unions 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
from time to time we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non union employees 
while these efforts have achieved only limited success to date  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future 
the company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger with caesars 
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the businesses of caesars with our businesses 
the combination of two independent companies is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
this process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies  and may not result in the full benefits expected by us and caesars

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our debt between fixed rate and variable rate obligations 
of our approximate billion total debt at december   billion  including the fixed rate debt for which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  is subject to variable interest rates 
the average interest rate on our variable rate debt  excluding the impact of our swap agreements  was at december  assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical change in interest rates would change interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
we utilize interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments 
we also utilize treasury rate locks to hedge the risk of future treasury rate increases for certain forecasted debt issuances 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the table below provides information as of december   about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations  interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks 
for debt obligations  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract and weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  for treasury rate locks  notional amounts are presented by contractual maturity dates  and average lock rates are based on contractual terms 
in millions thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt fixed rate  average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate treasury rate locks notional amount average lock rate the fair values are based on the borrowing rates currently available for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities and market quotes of the company s publicly traded debt 
the fair values are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes 
our long term variable rate debt reflects borrowings under revolving credit and letter of credit facilities provided to us by a consortium of banks with a total capacity of billion 
the interest rates charged on borrowings under these facilities are a function of the london inter bank offered rate  or libor and prime rate and are based on the rates as of december  as such  the interest rates charged to us for borrowings under the facilities are subject to change as libor changes 
foreign currency translation gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  although we are pursuing development opportunities in the united kingdom  we currently have no material ownership interests in businesses in foreign countries 
accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future operating results or cash flows
