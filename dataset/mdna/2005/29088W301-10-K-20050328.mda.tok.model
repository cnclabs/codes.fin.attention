item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a technology company providing individual animal tracking  food safety and database management services to the agricultural  foodservice and healthcare industries 
we are developing a broad portfolio of innovative products including verifeye  solo  cis and handscan contamination detection systems  for use in beef processing  and potentially in restaurants  hospitals  and retail food processors 
our agricultural products include cattlelog  a usda approved pvp providing individual animal data collection and reporting that enables livestock tracking  verification  and branding 
we are structured into two business segments  fst and ais 

table of contents key indicators of financial condition and operating performance we believe that sales growth will be our best indicator of success 
we believe that increased sales volume will be necessary to permit us to generate a self sustaining cash flow from operations 
the success of our business model depends on the broad acceptance of our technologies into markets that are just now developing as a result of the growing focus on food safety and assurance 
we believe that our products  if adopted on a wide scale basis  would have a significant impact on improving the safety  quality and confidence in our nation s food supply 
however  potential customers for our products historically have been very slow to change and reluctant to adopt new technologies and business practices 
this means that before the industry will fully embrace our primary technologies  like verifeye and cattlelog  they likely will conduct a substantial amount of due diligence and testing to ensure that the technology not only performs but also delivers an acceptable rate of return on their investment 
potential factors that may speed up industry adoption of our primary technologies include a regulatory or economic mandate that forces industry adoption 
as noted in how we operate key segments of the beef industry are currently experiencing poor market conditions  which could adversely effect sales of our products and services 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources in january  we completed a private equity placement of common stock and warrants  receiving million in cash 
cash and cash equivalents as of february  were million 
increases in sales of our products are expected to be the most important source of future cash flow 
we expect that our existing cash balances  working capital and sales of our products and services will only be sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for the next twelve months 
unless we are able to generate significantly higher sales from our products and services in  we will need to seek additional sources of liquidity and implement cost control measures 
there can be no assurance that sources of liquidity will be available in an amount and on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we are unable to significantly grow our sales in the next months or raise additional funds  our business may not ultimately be financially viable 
if required  we will continue to explore the need for other debt or equity financing alternatives to meet our working capital requirements 
if additional funds are raised through alternative debt financing that provides for the issuance of equity securities or through the issuance of equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any additional funding will be available when needed  or that if available  such financing will include favorable terms

sources and uses of cash as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million compared to million at december  our working capital balance as of december  was million compared to  as of december  with the addition of the million in private equity funding in january  our cash and cash equivalents as of february  is million and our working capital balance is million 
we have had significant negative cash flows from operating activities for each fiscal and quarterly period to date 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in in  cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of net operating losses offset by changes in working capital

in addition  we received  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our future working capital requirements will depend on a variety of factors including our successful implementation of our current business plan  the adoption and timely implementation of our products and our reduction of net cash outflow 
commercial and contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations  which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash rounded payments due by period total less than year years years more than years purchase orders operating lease commitments obligations relating to advance payments from customers total contractual obligations general inflation has not had a significant impact on our business and it is not expected to have a major impact in the foreseeable future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to lease revenues from two verifeye cis units in the current year compared to lease revenues from one verifeye cis unit for approximately three and one half months in contributed  in revenues in compared to  in  as well as an increase in both cattlelog and electronic identification eid tag revenues in the current year contributed  and  in revenues  respectively  in compared to  and  respectively  in 
these increases were offset by a decrease in revenues from the sale of verifeye solo units contributed  in revenues in compared to  in and a decrease in supply chain management consulting fees  due to the termination of a contract in july  contributed in revenues in compared to  in 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due principally to the increase in revenues in and the associated increases in direct costs 
we generated a gross profit of  or for the year ended december  compared to  or for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit is due primarily to the increase in revenues and a reduction in indirect overhead costs in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  reflecting increased professional fees and insurance costs offset in part by a reduction in expenses for salaries and wages 
in addition  the current year includes provisions for obsolete inventory of  non cash stock compensation expense of  incurred as the result of accelerating the vesting and extending the expiration date of stock options in accordance with separation agreements with two former officers of the company and a non cash expense of  due to the issuance of restricted stock as consideration for consulting services 
technology and development our technology and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase in development costs for a prototype unit for handscan  our hand hygiene product  and other derivative verifeye products 
as we continue to expand verifeye derivative products  such as handscan  these costs are expected to increase 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to an increase in the portion of property  plant and equipment that was fully depreciated during other income and expense interest and other income  net increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  other income for the current year consisted of interest income of  and miscellaneous income consisting of a  gain due to the favorable settlement of a capital lease obligation and the receipt of  in royalty payments from the amiris technology license  offset in part by miscellaneous rental expense of  income for the year ended december   consisted of interest income of  and the receipt of  in royalty payments from the amiris technology license and miscellaneous income from various sources of  offset in part by miscellaneous expense of approximately  related to the settlement of disputed consulting fees incurred in a prior period and the associated arbitration fees and miscellaneous rental expense of  interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to the settlement of our capital lease obligation during the first quarter of net decrease in fair value of common stock warrants and additional investment rights of million for represents the net decrease in fair value of the warrants and the additional investment rights that we issued in connection with our january private equity financing from the transaction date of january  through december  of million and million  respectively  and the net increase in fair value of the warrants issued in our november private equity financing from december  to december   of  the increase in fair value of common stock warrants of  for represents the 
table of contents increase in the estimated fair value of the warrants that we issued in connection with our private equity financing from the transaction date of november  through december  these transactions are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective december   the registration rights agreements for both the november and january private equity financings were amended to clarify that we are not liable for liquidated damages with respect to the warrant shares 
under eitf  this amendment changed the accounting for the warrant shares  which were reclassified to stockholders equity on december   after the change in their fair value was determined as of december  and the net decrease in fair value of the warrants was included in net decrease in fair value of common stock warrants and additional investment rights in the consolidated statement of operations 
due to losses incurred  we did not recognize income tax expense for the years ended december  and as of december   we had approximately million of federal income tax loss carry forwards that can be used to offset future taxable income 
our tax loss carry forwards begin to expire in and we are not currently aware of any limitation on our ability to offset future taxable income 
utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in the event of an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code 
discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we determined that in order to improve our productivity and our use of working capital we would sell or dispose of all of our previously acquired cattle operations 
through the subsequent divestitures  we significantly changed our market focus and revenue source 
as of january   the divestiture of all cattle operations was complete 
the results of operations of the acquired  and subsequently disposed  entities are included in our consolidated statements of operations under discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets sold included only property and equipment 
all associated goodwill was reduced to zero 
there were no liabilities in the disposal group 
the revenue and pretax gain loss related to assets sold or disposed amounted to years ended december  revenue pretax gain loss the loss from discontinued operations in the year ended december  includes the payment of legal expenses relating to previously closed cattle operations and the write down to fair market value of assets held for sale  partially offset by the collection of receivables  previously considered uncollectible 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in revenues from the sale of verifeye solo units and the introduction of revenues from the lease of a verifeye cis unit for the period from september  through december  this increase is partially offset by a change in marketing strategy for eid tags in the second quarter of contributed  in revenues in compared to  in  the nonrenewal of a feedyard data management service contract in the first quarter of contributed  in compared to in and the discontinuation of the sale of web advertising at the end of contributed  in compared to in 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is due principally to the reduction in costs for eid tags from the prior year  which contributed costs of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  in addition  indirect overhead costs  such as support personnel  facilities costs  telecommunication charges and material purchases were reduced by approximately  in the current year 
these decreases in cost of revenues were offset by the costs associated with the sale of verifeye solo units and depreciation on the verifeye cis unit in we generated gross profits of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit is due primarily to the increase in both verifeye solo and verifeye cis revenues  which consist of higher margin technology products and a decrease in sales of eid tags  which typically generate lower profit margins  as well as the decrease in indirect overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily associated with the cost savings initiatives that have been implemented over the last two years and include decreases in salaries and wages  communications  travel  advertising and media expenses 
technology and development our technology and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily associated with the reduction of workforce and decreases in consulting  materials and supplies and facilities expenses 
furthermore  the company had fewer products under development and products such as cattlelog  our exclusive individual animal data collection and reporting system and verifeye solo  were essentially complete 
impairment  restructuring and related charges the impairment  restructuring and related charges incurred in the year ended december   consist of  in severance and related outplacement benefits for employees who were terminated during the second quarter of   in other closure  employee and professional costs  an impairment charge of  to write down to fair value the capitalized software expenses incurred to establish our interactive website  which was replaced with a less expensive website design  an impairment of  to write off the unamortized goodwill associated with our acquisition of cyberstockyard  inc and  to write off the unamortized goodwill associated with our acquisition of pcc 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the disposal of approximately  of property  plant and equipment and non cash impairment of approximately  of property  plant and equipment during the last three quarters of other income and expense interest and other income  net decreased to  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous income in to  from million in  relating primarily to the settlement of certain consulting 
table of contents and litigation fees  which had been previously accrued 
in addition  interest income for the year ended december   decreased to  from  in the year ended december   generated principally by notes receivable from related parties outstanding in this income was offset in by miscellaneous expenses from several sources of  interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to the termination of the line of credit on may  the increase in fair value of common stock warrants represents the increase in the estimated fair value of the warrants that we issued in connection with our private equity financing from the transaction date of november  through december  this transaction is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on may   we terminated our million revolving line of credit agreement from cit and agreed to pay a termination fee of  as a result of the termination  we recorded a loss of million related to the write off of unamortized financing costs and the termination fee 
the impairment of investment in unconsolidated investee consists of a non cash charge of million to write down our investment in turnkey computer systems to its estimated fair value 
the investment was subsequently sold back to turnkey computer systems  inc for  in cash 
the resulting gain on sale was not material 
due to the losses incurred  we did not recognize income tax expense for the years ended december  and as of december   we had approximately million of federal income tax loss carry forwards that can be used to offset future taxable income 
discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we determined that in order to improve our productivity and our use of working capital we would sell or dispose of all of our previously acquired cattle operations

in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which the company s financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting principles identified relate to revenue recognition  accounting for obligations and instruments potentially to be settled in our stock  and long lived assets 
these critical accounting policies and our other significant accounting policies are further disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues from the sale of all ais products and services are recognized as products are shipped or services are provided 
we recognize revenues from the sale of hand held verifeye solo units using the revenue recognition principles of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
these principles provide that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangements meet the following criteria the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a right of return  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
in addition  these principles provide that arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the amount allocated to the delivered item s is limited to that amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting specified performance conditions 
finally  these principles provide that applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting 
solo sales are reviewed by management to determine the separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenues among these units of accounting 
revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as products are shipped or services are provided 
we also follow the revenue recognition principles of sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
when we sell products and give the buyer the right to return the product  revenue from the sales transactions are recognized at the time of the sale only if all of the specified conditions have been met 
sales revenue and cost of sales that are not recognized at the time of the sale because the specified conditions have not been met are recognized either when the return privilege has substantially expired or if those conditions are subsequently met  whichever occurs first 
revenues from operating leases of verifeye cis units are reported on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
accounting for obligations and instruments potentially to be settled in the company s stock we account for obligations and instruments potentially to be settled in our stock in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock 
this issue addresses the initial balance sheet classification and measurement of contracts that are indexed to  and potentially settled in  our own stock 
under eitf contracts are initially classified as equity or as either assets or liabilities  in the following situations equity contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement  and contracts that give an issuer a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in its own shares physical settlement or net share settlement  assuming that all the criteria for equity classification have been met 

table of contents assets or liabilities contracts that require net cash settlement including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the company  and contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares physical settlement or net share settlement 
all contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently accounted for based on the then current classification 
contracts initially classified as equity do not recognize subsequent changes in fair value as long as the contracts continue to be classified as equity 
for contracts classified as assets or liabilities  we report changes in fair value in earnings and disclose these changes in the financial statements as long as the contracts remain classified as assets or liabilities 
if contracts classified as assets or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares  any previously reported gains or losses on those contracts continue to be included in earnings 
the classification of a contract is reassessed at each balance sheet date 
on november   we issued  shares of common stock to the biegert family irrevocable trust in a private placement transaction the biegert transaction for per share  receiving proceeds of million 
in connection with the transaction  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants were exercisable immediately and expire november  the million of proceeds were allocated to the common stock and warrants based on their relative fair values 
on january   we issued  shares of common stock to a group of investors in a private placement transaction the sage transaction for per share  receiving gross proceeds of million 
in connection with the transaction  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and additional investment rights to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the exercise price of the additional investment rights was per share and these rights expired unexercised on july  the exercise price of the warrants was per share at time of issuance and was repriced to per share in january the warrants were exercisable immediately and expire on january  the million of net proceeds were allocated to the common stock  warrants and additional investment rights based on their relative fair values 
in accordance with eitf  a transaction which includes a potential for net cash settlement  including liquidated damages  requires that derivative financial instruments  including warrants and additional investment rights  initially be recorded at fair value as an asset or liability and subsequent changes in fair value be reflected in the statement of operations 
the registration rights agreements for both the biegert transaction and the sage transaction provided that if the registration statements for the warrants and additional investment rights did not remain effective  it is possible we would be required to make cash payments  as liquidated damages 
in accordance with eitf  the fair values of the warrants and the additional investment rights were accounted for as a liability  and subsequent changes in their fair value are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
effective december   the registration rights agreements for both the biegert transaction and the sage transaction were amended and we are no longer liable for liquidated damages with respect to the warrant shares 
under eitf  this amendment changed the classification of the warrants from a liability to permanent equity for the warrant shares  which were reclassified to additional paid in capital on december   after the change in their fair value was determined as of december  long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 

table of contents under sfas no 
 long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are classified as held for sale when six specific criteria are met 
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill is included in an asset group when the asset group is or includes a reporting unit 
the results of operations of a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of an entity 
in the period in which a component of an entity has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale  the income statement for current and prior periods report the results of operations of the component  including any gain or loss resulting from adjustments to fair value  in discontinued operations 
assets not meeting the criteria of held for sale  continue to be classified as held and used until they are disposed of 
impairment losses for assets held and used are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group exceeds its fair value and are included in continuing operations 
during the second quarter of  we determined that we would sell or close all the remaining owned cattle operations 
in connection with the determination to divest these operations and pursuant to sfas no 
 we evaluated the fair value of the long lived assets  including intangibles of our cattle operations 
the assets of the operations  which were liquidated or sold  were adjusted to the estimated fair value and both the write down of these assets and the results of operations for these businesses are included in discontinued operations 

table of contents factors affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements can be identified by the use of predictive  future tense or forward looking terminology  such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  will and words of similar meaning 
these statements include statements regarding  among other things  our product and service development  projected capital expenditures  liquidity and capital  development of additional revenue sources  expansion into new market segments  technological advancement  ability to develop brand awareness and market acceptance of our products and services 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements  including the acceptance by our customers of our products and services  our ability to grow revenue  the impact of competition on pricing  general economic conditions  employee turnover  the impact of litigation and other factors 
other factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in factors affecting our business  financial condition and results of operation  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and as set forth from time to time in our other public filings and public statements 
readers of this report are cautioned to consider these risks and uncertainties and to not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
we obtained the market and competitive position data used throughout this report from our own research  surveys or studies conducted by third parties  industry or general publications 
industry publications and surveys generally state that they have obtained information from sources believed to be reliable  but do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such information 
while we believe that each of these studies and publications is reliable  we have not independently verified such data  and we do not make any representations as to the accuracy of such information 
similarly  we believe our internal research is reliable  but it has not been verified by independent sources 
in addition to the other information included in this report and our other public filings and releases  the following factors should be considered when evaluating our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects we have a history of net losses and negative cash flows from operations and expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operations for at least the next year 
if we continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operations  our business may not ultimately be financially viable 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  and a net loss of million for the year ended december   or of total revenue 
as of december   we had accumulated net losses totaling million 
our revenue may not grow as anticipated and  as a result  our financial condition and results of our operations may be harmed and our business may not be financially viable in the future 
to achieve profitability and improve cash flow from operations  we must successfully address the following risks while maintaining or growing our profit margins adverse market conditions existing within segments of the us beef industry  lack of wide scale commercial acceptance of our products and services  lack of wide scale sales and distribution channels for our products and services  failure to introduce new products and services  
table of contents inability to respond promptly to competitive and industry developments  failure to achieve brand recognition  and failure to upgrade and enhance our technologies to accommodate expanded product and service offerings and increased customer demand 
although we have recently raised million of equity capital to support operations  if we are unable to significantly grow the sales of our products and services in the next months  we will need to either raise debt or equity capital and further reduce operating costs to maintain a sufficient cash balance 
we expect cash balances will be sufficient to operate throughout fiscal should we find it necessary to raise additional funds  we may find that such funds are either not available or are available only on terms that are unattractive due to cost or dilution of existing shareholders interest  or both 
in the event that we find it necessary to raise additional funds to sustain operations and we are unable to do so  our business may not ultimately be financially viable 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  results of operations and financial condition is likely to be adversely effected 
if our products do not achieve broad market acceptance  our business may not ultimately be successful 
we believe that broad market acceptance  reflected in increased sales volume  will be necessary to permit us to generate a self sustaining cash flow from operations 
the success of our business model depends on the broad acceptance of our technologies into markets that are just now developing as a result of the growing focus on food safety and assurance 
furthermore  some of our primary target segments within the us beef industry are experiencing unpredictable economic conditions and are expected to continue to struggle with supply  trade and profitability issues in the near term 
although we believe that our products  if adopted on a wide scale basis  would have a significant impact on improving the safety  quality and confidence in our nation s food supply  our customers for these products historically have been very slow to change and reluctant to adopt new technologies and business practices 
this means that before our target customers will fully embrace technology like verifeye and cattlelog  there will be a substantial amount of due diligence and testing to ensure that the technology not only performs but also delivers an acceptable rate of return on investment 
if our target markets do not have the financial resources to purchase our product or do not complete their due diligence and testing and  ultimately  adopt our products  in a timely basis  our business will be harmed 
any significant defect in our products could cause us to lose revenue and expose us to product liability claims 
the products we offer are inherently complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  have in the past and may in the future contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced 
these errors and defects could cause damage to our reputation  loss of revenue  product returns  order cancellations or lack of market acceptance for our products 
we have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our products to fix these errors or defects 
our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provisions contained in our agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial 
in addition  our insurance against product liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim 
our two business segments are difficult to evaluate because they have a limited operating history 
although we were formed in  our current product and service offerings have a very limited operating history 
if we are unable to expand the market for the products and services of both our fst segment and our ais segment  or if any of our products are not adopted by our target customers or do not perform as we expect them to  our results of operations and prospects will be materially and adversely impacted 

table of contents our business may be harmed by competitors 
we may face competition from companies that may develop competing technologies or services 
because the market for beef production consists primarily of a number of large producers  it is possible that these competing technologies or services will be created by companies with significantly greater resources than ours 
in the event we are unable to effectively compete with these potential new technologies or services  our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted 
our ability to develop new products is uncertain and our products may not develop as we anticipate 
the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of developing new products is inherently uncertain 
prospective products  such as derivative products relating to our existing meat inspection system  require time and resources to develop  may not ultimately be commercially viable  may not achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace and may fail to receive regulatory approval  if required 
in addition  new products by competitors could adversely affect the realization of products that are commercially successful 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law and confidentiality agreements with third parties 
we cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  the patents or trademarks may be challenged by other parties  infringed upon or invalidated 
because brand recognition is an important component of our business strategy  the protection of our trademarks is critical to our success 
in addition  we depend upon our proprietary database of industry and client information to provide our clients with our information services 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and technology or obtain access to our confidential proprietary database 
other parties may also breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts 
we may not become aware of these breaches or have adequate remedies available 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trademark protection may be unavailable in certain countries to which we might expand our operations 
we are also reliant on our exclusive licensing agreement with iowa state university and the agricultural research service 
if we breach this agreement  our rights to the technology incorporated into our food safety products could be limited or eliminated  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in technology markets  there is generally frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims that we infringe third party proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert patent  copyright or other infringement claims against us that could prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our products or services in the united states and abroad 
there also can be no assurance that former employers of our present and future employees will not claim that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of our personnel
