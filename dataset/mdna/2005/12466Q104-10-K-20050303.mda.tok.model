actual results could differ materially from historical results or those anticipated by such statements 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the corporation include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates general economic conditions the legislative regulatory climate monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios demand for loan products deposit flows competition demand for financial services in the corporation s market area technology and accounting principles  policies and guidelines these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements contained herein 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
the following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of the corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies that required our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  or using different assumptions  are described below 
allowance for loan losses we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  overall portfolio quality and specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 

table of contents impairment of loans we measure impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
a valuation allowance is maintained to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
the loans currently designated as impaired are being valued based on collateral 
the reserves that we have established are based on appraisals of the collateral and have been adjusted for items such as selling costs and current conditions 
we believe these adjustments are reasonable 
impairment of securities impairment of investment securities results in a write down that must be included in net income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
we regularly review each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price  the duration of that market decline  the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer and our ability and intention with regard to holding the security to maturity 
valuation of derivatives the corporation enters into rate lock commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that are originated for resale are considered to be derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from to days 
for such rate lock commitments  we protect the corporation from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments  whereby an investor commits to buy the loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the investor has assumed the interest rate risk on the loan 
as a result  the corporation is not exposed to losses nor will it realize gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates 
the market values of rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not readily ascertainable with precision because rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not actively traded 
because of the high correlation between rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts  no gain or loss occurs on the rate lock commitments 
goodwill on january   the corporation adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
in assessing the recoverability of the corporation s goodwill  all of which was recognized in connection with the bank s acquisition of c f finance in september  we must make assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
major assumptions used in determining impairment were increases in future income  sales multiples in determining terminal value and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
we completed the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment to be recognized in as part of the impairment test  we performed sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate  lowering sales multiples and reducing increases in future income 
based on the sensitivity analysis performed  no charge for impairment was determined to be necessary 
if the underlying estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
defined benefit pension plan the bank maintains a non contributory  defined benefit pension plan for eligible full time employees as specified by the plan 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities  are valued using market quotations 
the bank s actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions 
key 
table of contents assumptions include the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
changes in these assumptions in the future  if any  may impact pension expense as measured in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
accounting for income taxes determining the corporation s effective tax rate requires judgment 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain 
in addition  the corporation s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although we believe that the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the income tax provision and accrual 
for further information concerning accounting policies  refer to note of the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
overview our primary financial goals are to maximize the corporation s earnings and to deploy capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance shareholder value 
we track three primary financial performance measures in order to assess the level of success in achieving these goals return on average assets return on average equity growth in earnings in addition to these financial performance measures  we track the performance of the corporation s three principal business activities retail banking mortgage banking consumer finance we also actively manage our capital through growth stock repurchases dividends financial performance measures for the corporation  net income declined percent to million in fiscal net income per diluted share declined percent to in the same period 
the corporation s roa was percent for the year ended december  compared with percent for  and its roe was percent for the year ended december  compared with percent for although all of our financial performance measures declined in  net income reflected the complementary balance of the corporation s business segments 
for the year  our mortgage banking segment s net income declined  as anticipated  after the record year that resulted from s strong mortgage loan demand 
this decline was partly offset by increased net income in both the retail banking and consumer finance segments 
these increases reflected economic growth that boosted commercial and consumer loan demand  as well as interest rates  in the second half of 
table of contents we expect the following factors to influence the corporation s financial performance in interest rate volatility  which will likely continue to affect demand for home mortgage loans in the mortgage banking segment and affect the net interest margin in the retail banking segment  general economic trends in our markets  which can affect the quality of the loan portfolios in the retail banking and consumer finance segments  the ability to expand the mortgage banking segment by opening or acquiring new production offices  in conjunction with the expansion of the segment s product offerings in cooperation with the retail banking segment  the ability to expand the retail banking segment by opening or acquiring new branches  loan demand at the retail banking segment  the extent to which deposit and loan growth at the retail banking branch in newport news  virginia  along with the new branches projected to open in  create market penetration on the virginia peninsula  the extent to which loan demand is affected by the increased competition in the consumer finance segment  and the effectiveness of updated technology at the consumer finance segment in enhancing dealer relationships  improving operational efficiencies and expanding capacity for new business in existing and new markets 
principal business activities an overview of the financial results for each of the corporation s principal segments is presented below 
a more detailed discussion is included in the section results of operations 
retail banking pretax earnings for the retail banking segment were million for the year ended december   compared with million in the increase in pretax earnings for the comparative month periods primarily resulted from higher average earning assets  which were principally funded by growth in deposits  an increase in net interest margin  a lower provision for loan losses and an increase in non interest income 
these improvements were offset in part by an increase in non interest expense 
the increase in average earning assets and the net interest margin resulted from a higher average balance of loans to third party customers by the retail banking segment 
a lower provision for loan losses was required in because we decreased reserve allocation percentages based on historical charge offs and current economic conditions 
the increase in non interest income reflected the effect of deposit growth on deposit service charges  which was partially offset by a decline in calls of securities that resulted from the rising interest rate environment in the increase in non interest expense reflected an increase in salaries and benefits for bank operations and administrative personnel to support growth and the expansion of the retail banking segment into the peninsula and hanover markets of virginia 
mortgage banking pretax earnings for the mortgage banking segment were million for the year ended december   compared with million in the decrease in earnings resulted from declines in loan refinancings  lower gains on sales of a proportionately higher volume of variable rate loans versus fixed rate loans and the lower interest rate spread on loans held for sale 
for  loan originations at c f mortgage for refinancings declined to million from million in loans originated for new and resale home purchases declined slightly to million from million in the volume of mortgage loan applications  closings  fundings and the level of the mortgage loan pipeline followed a more seasonal pattern in we expect that future earnings for the mortgage banking segment will be negatively affected if the upward trend in interest rates continues and there are fewer new and resale home sales and loan refinancings 

table of contents consumer finance pretax earnings for the consumer finance segment  which consists solely of c f finance  totaled million for the year ended december   compared with pre tax earnings of million in a percent increase in average loans outstanding favorably impacted earnings in however  earnings also included a million increase in the provision for loan losses as a result of higher charge offs against the allowance for loan losses versus dealer reserves in effective january   the consumer finance segment no longer originated loans that provided for dealer reserves 
in addition  earnings for included an increase in the cost of borrowings and in operating expenses to support growth and technology investments 
we expect the continuing investments in technology to create future efficiencies and to expand capacity 
in addition  we expect the initial salary costs associated with the expansion of the consumer finance segment into the northern virginia and nashville  tennessee markets will affect short term earnings of the consumer finance segment 
future earnings at the consumer finance segment will be impacted by economic conditions including  but not limited to  the employment market  interest rates and the resale market for used automobiles 
capital management during  our total assets grew by percent 
a detailed discussion of the changes in our financial position is included in the section financial condition 
our dividend pay out increased to percent in from percent in we increased the quarterly dividend per share by percent in and by percent over the past two years 
in  we repurchased  of the corporation s common stock and in we repurchased  shares 
in  we will continue to employ capital management strategies that are similar to those employed in recent years 

table of contents table average balances  income and expense  yields and rates the following table shows the average balance sheets for each of the years ended december   and the table also shows the amounts of interest earned on earning assets  with related yields and interest on interest bearing liabilities  together with the rates  are shown 
loans include loans held for sale 
loans placed on a non accrual status are included in the balances and are included in the computation of yields  but had no material effect 
interest on tax exempt securities is presented on a taxable equivalent basis which converts the income on loans and investments for which no taxes are paid to the equivalent yield if taxes were paid  which is computed using the federal corporate income tax rate of percent in and and percent in dollars in thousands average balance income expense yield rate average balance income expense yield rate average balance income expense yield rate assets securities taxable tax exempt total securities loans  net interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds total earning assets allowance for loan losses total non earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity time and savings deposits interest bearing deposits money market deposit accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit  thousand or more other certificates of deposit total time and savings deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities demand deposits other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income interest rate spread interest expense to average earning assets net interest margin for purposes of yield  interest rate spread and net interest margin calculations  interest income in excluded of interest previously recognized as principal curtailments on loans removed from non accrual status in 
table of contents results of operations net interest income compared to net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or percent  from million for the comparable period in the higher net interest income resulted from an increase of percent in the average balance of interest earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin to percent in from percent in average loans outstanding remained relatively flat during  while the yield increased basis points to 
a million increase in loans held for investment was offset by a million decrease in the average loans held for sale 
the increase in average loans held for investment resulted from an increase in loans at the retail banking and consumer finance segments 
the increase in loans at the retail banking segment was mainly attributable to loan production in the virginia peninsula market 
the increase in the consumer finance segment was mainly attributable to the new markets this segment serves  in addition to overall growth at existing locations 
the decrease in average loans held for sale was a result of the increase in mortgage interest rates that began in the third quarter of the yield on loans held for investment at the retail banking segment and the consumer finance segment increased basis points and basis points  respectively 
these increases were a result of the impact of a basis point increase in the prime rate during the second half of the yield on loans held for sale remained relatively flat 
this was mainly a result of the shift in originations to lower yielding adjustable rate mortgages versus fixed rate products 
average securities available for sale increased million during  and the average yield on these securities declined by basis points 
the decline in the taxable equivalent yields resulted from the maturities and calls of higher yielding securities during and and the reinvestment of proceeds in lower yielding securities as a result of the lower rate environment in the first half of average interest earning deposits at other banks  primarily the fhlb  increased million and their average yield increased by basis points as a result of the increase in short term interest rates during the second half of the increase in average interest earning deposits at other banks reflected deposit growth and the decrease in average loans held for sale  which resulted in excess funds in lower yielding accounts 
a basis point decrease in the cost of deposits during was a result of the falling interest rate environment in prior periods and the increase in non interest bearing demand deposits as a percentage of total average deposits 
the lower rate environment resulted in decreases in the rates paid on savings and interest bearing checking accounts and the repricing of maturing certificates of deposit at lower rates 
the increase in non interest bearing demand deposits was a result of the bank s efforts to attract these deposits through product offerings and an emphasis on obtaining transactional deposit accounts from its commercial customers 
although interest rates increased in the second half of  deposits will reprice gradually as existing certificates of deposit mature in future periods 

table of contents the decrease in the rate on other borrowings in resulted from a lower libor based rate on c f finance s line of credit with an unrelated third party and the repayment of million in debt that carried interest rates of percent to percent and that was associated with the acquisition of c f finance 
we expect that the net interest margin will benefit in the short term as prime based loans reprice as the prime rate changes 
however  we also expect that the favorable impact of the deposit repricing lag will neutralize in the longer term and the cost of other borrowings will continue to increase as short term interest rates rise 
compared to during  net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  increased percent to million from million in the higher net interest income resulted from an increase of percent in the average balance of interest earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin to percent in from percent in the increase in average earning assets reflected an million increase in the average balance of loans and a million increase in the average balance of interest earning deposits at other banks  primarily the fhlb  offset in part by a slight decrease in the average balance of securities 
the increase in average loans resulted from an increase in loans at the bank  the acquisition of c f finance and an increase in loans held for sale at c f mortgage 
the increase in average loans at the bank approximated million in the increase in average loans at c f finance  which was acquired september   approximated million 
the increase in average loans held for sale at c f mortgage approximated million in  and resulted from an increase in originations at c f mortgage 
loans originated at c f mortgage totaled billion in and million in  loans sold at c f mortgage totaled billion in and million in average interest earning deposits at other banks increased because our deposit growth exceeded loan demand and calls of investment securities in the low interest rate environment resulted in excess funds in lower yielding accounts 
the increase in the corporation s taxable equivalent net interest margin reflected an increase in the yield on interest earning assets to percent in from percent in  coupled with a decrease in the cost of funds to percent in from percent in the yield on interest earning assets was favorably impacted by the higher yield on average loans at c f finance relative to the bank and c f mortgage 
for  c f finance had average loans of million with individual loan rates ranging from percent to percent 
the favorable impact of c f finance s yield was partly offset by a decrease in the yield on loans held by the bank  which resulted from the low interest rate environment  and by an increase in the average balance of lower yielding loans held for sale at c f mortgage 
the taxable equivalent yield on the corporation s securities portfolio declined to percent for from percent for as a result of the maturities and calls of higher yielding securities  coupled with the reinvestment of proceeds in lower yielding securities 
the decrease in the cost of funds for reflected lower rates on interest bearing deposits  money market deposits and savings accounts and the repricing of maturing certificates of deposit at lower rates  offset in part by higher cost funds related to c f finance 
c f finance has a line of credit with an unrelated third party 
this line of credit bears interest at libor plus basis points 
as part of the acquisition of c f finance  the corporation borrowed million from the fhlb at rates between percent and percent and million from an unrelated third party at percent interest 
as part of the purchase price of c f finance  the bank issued million in subordinated debt at percent to the former shareholders of c f finance 
the million loan and the million in subordinated debt were repaid in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents interest income and expense are affected by fluctuations in interest rates  by changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and by the interaction of rate and volume factors 
table shows the direct causes of the year to year changes in the components of net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
we calculated the rate and volume variances using a formula prescribed by the sec 
rate volume variances  the third element in the calculation  are not shown separately in the table  but are allocated to the rate and volume variances in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

the decline in volume at the mortgage banking segment also contributed to lower title insurance revenue  which is included in other income 
in addition  gains on calls of available for sale securities at the retail banking segment decreased as a result of fewer calls in these decreases were offset in part by higher service charge income resulting from deposit account growth 
compared to total non interest income increased by million  or percent  in the increase was attributable to an increase in gains on sales of loans and other service charges and fees resulting from an increase in the volume of loans closed and sold by the mortgage banking segment 
the increase also included an increase in service charges at the retail banking segment  resulting from the bank s overdraft program that was started at the beginning of the increase in gains on calls of available for sale securities reflected calls of securities at premiums due to the low interest rate environment during

the retail banking segment opened a branch in mechanicsville  virginia at the end of and a branch in newport news  virginia in january start up costs associated with the bank s expansion efforts will continue throughout as we expect the bank to begin construction of two new branches on the virginia peninsula 
we will also incur additional costs as the retail banking segment relocates its operations departments to a new facility in the consumer finance segment continues to invest in both technology and people to create efficiencies and serve new markets 
we have hired additional personnel to begin serving that segment s northern virginia and nashville  tennessee markets 
a decrease in non interest expenses for the mortgage banking segment resulted from lower production based compensation and operating expenses 

table of contents compared to non interest expense in increased million  or percent  over this increase was attributable to the acquisition of c f finance in september  higher variable compensation costs and other operating expenses at the mortgage banking segment resulting from the increase in loan production and the increase in personnel expenses at the retail banking segment resulting from an increase in operations and administrative personnel  as well as higher employee benefits expense 
the increase in benefits costs was attributable to higher pension and health care costs and an increase in the average number of full time equivalent employees 
income taxes applicable income taxes on earnings amounted to million  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent  compared with million  or percent  in and million  or percent  in the decrease in the effective tax rate for resulted from a higher proportion of earnings from tax exempt assets  such as obligations of states and political subdivisions 
the change in the composition of earnings mainly reflected the lower earnings at the mortgage banking segment 
conversely  the increase in the effective tax rate for as compared to resulted from a decrease in earnings from tax exempt assets as a percentage of total income mainly resulting from the increased earnings at the mortgage banking and the consumer finance segments 

table of contents asset quality allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
the provision for loan losses increases the allowance  and loans charged off  net of recoveries  reduce the allowance 
the following table presents the corporation s loan loss experience for the periods indicated table allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance  beginning of period provision for loan losses retail banking and mortgage banking consumer finance total provision for loan losses loans charged off real estate residential mortgage real estate construction commercial  financial and agricultural consumer consumer finance total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate residential mortgage commercial  financial and agricultural consumer consumer finance total recoveries net loans charged off acquisition of moore loans allowance  end of period ratio of net charge offs to average total loans outstanding during period for consumer finance ratio of net charge offs to average total loans outstanding during period for retail banking and mortgage banking during  the allowance for loan losses at the combined retail banking and mortgage banking segments remained basically unchanged 
the consumer finance segment  consisting solely of c f finance  accounted for the majority of the activity in the allowance for loan losses during in addition to maintaining the allowance for loan losses  c f finance has retained dealer reserves that were established at the time loans were made and are specific to each individual dealer 
loans charged off at c f finance have first been charged to the dealer reserves  to the extent that an individual dealer had reserves  and the remainder has been charged to the allowance for loan losses 
dealer reserves are a liability of c f finance and payable to individual dealers upon the termination of the relationship with c f finance and the payment of outstanding loans associated with a specific dealer 
in order to conform its 
table of contents dealer agreements to standard industry practices  c f finance ceased originating loans with a dealer reserve provision at january  however  existing dealer reserves at december  were retained to absorb future losses for each specific dealer 
the provision for loan losses and the corresponding allowance for loan losses at the consumer finance segment will increase in future periods as dealer reserves are reduced by virtue of loan charge offs or balance pay offs to dealers 
the following table summarizes the dealer reserves activity year ended december  dollars in thousands dealer reserves at the beginning of year reserve holdback at loan origination loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off acquisition of c f finance dealer reserves at the end of year c f finance serves customers who have limited access to traditional automobile financing 
c f finance s typical borrowers have experienced prior credit difficulties or have modest income 
because c f finance serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources  we expect c f finance to sustain a higher level of credit losses than traditional automobile financing sources 
throughout  we implemented changes to the loan underwriting guidelines to improve asset quality on new loans 
as a result  aggregate charge offs to the allowance for loan losses and dealer reserves declined in because c f finance provides financing in a relatively higher risk market  c f finance generally charges interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources 
loan loss allowance methodology retail and mortgage banking 
we conduct an analysis of the loan portfolio on a regular basis 
we use this analysis to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and to determine the necessary provision for loan losses 
the review process generally begins with loan officers identifying problem loans to be reviewed on an individual basis for impairment 
in addition to these loans  all commercial loans are considered for individual impairment testing 
impairment testing includes consideration of the current collateral value for each loan  as well as any known internal or external factors that may affect collectibility 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we may establish a specific allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed fair value 
we segregate the loans meeting the criteria for special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  as well as impaired loans  from performing loans within the portfolio 
we then group loans by loan type eg  commercial  consumer and by risk rating eg  substandard  doubtful 
we assign each loan type an allowance factor based on the associated risk  complexity and size of the individual loans within the particular loan category 
we assign classified loans a higher allowance factor than non rated loans within a particular loan type based on our concerns regarding collectibility or our knowledge of particular elements surrounding the borrower 
our allowance factors increase with the severity of classification 
allowance factors used for unclassified loans are based on our analysis of charge off history and our judgment based on the overall analysis of the lending environment including the general economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is the aggregate of specific allowances  the calculated allowance required for classified loans by category and the general allowance for each portfolio type 

table of contents in conjunction with the methodology described above  we consider the following risk elements that are inherent in the loan portfolio residential real estate loans and equity lines of credit carry risks associated with the continued credit worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral 
construction loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule  the project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may at any point in time be less than the principal amount of the loan 
construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor  who may or may not be a bank loan customer  is unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure unrelated to the project 
commercial real estate loans may carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business or a real estate project  in addition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate  because the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business or project 
commercial business loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business  which is usually the source of loan repayment  and the value of the collateral  which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate 
consumer loans carry risks associated with the continued credit worthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral eg  rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles  or lack thereof 
consumer loans are more likely than real estate loans to be immediately adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
loan loss allowance methodology consumer finance 
the consumer finance segment s loans consist of non prime automobile loans 
these loans carry risks associated with the continued credit worthiness of borrowers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources and the value of rapidly depreciating collateral 
these loans do not lend themselves to a classification process because of the short duration of time between delinquency and repossession 
therefore  the loan loss analysis review process generally focuses on the rates of delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses 
allowance factors also include an analysis of charge off history and our judgment based on the overall analysis of the lending environment

consumer finance dollars in thousands non accrual loans accruing loans past due for days or more allowance for loan losses dealer reserves non accrual consumer finance loans to total consumer finance loans allowance for loan losses to total consumer finance loans dealer reserves to total consumer finance loans total allowance for loans losses and dealer reserves to total consumer finance loans 
table of contents as shown in table  the non performing assets of the combined retail and mortgage banking segments increased to million as of december   compared with million at december  this increase resulted primarily from one commercial real estate loan relationship that became more than days delinquent and was placed on non accrual status in the first quarter of the non accrual principal balance outstanding of this relationship is million for which we have recorded a specific reserve of  at december  we are closely monitoring this relationship 
the increase in non accrual loans attributable to this relationship was offset in part by the removal of another commercial loan relationship approximating  from non accrual status 
although this relationship was contractually past due more than days at december   we have determined that a return to accrual status was appropriate based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral  the improved financial strength of the borrower and a sustained period of contractual repayment performance 
the decrease in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans resulted from a review of the loan loss calculation and the reserve allocation percentages used in the calculation 
in several instances  we decreased these allocation percentages based on historical charge offs and current economic conditions 
we believe that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any losses that may become uncollectible 
as shown in table  non performing assets of the consumer finance segment increased to million at december  from million at december   and was accompanied by an increase in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses and dealer reserves to non accrual loans to percent at december  from percent at december throughout  we implemented changes to the loan underwriting guidelines to improve asset quality on new loans 
charge offs during the first half of included loans that were originated under previous guidelines and that were non performing at december  as previously mentioned  effective january   c f finance no longer originates loans with a dealer reserve provision 
therefore  the ratio of dealer reserves to total consumer finance loans declined from percent at december  to percent at december  the decline in the dealer reserves is offset in part by a higher provision for loan losses that resulted in an increase in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total consumer finance loans from percent at december  to percent at december  during periods of economic slowdown or recession  delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses generally increase at the consumer finance segment 
these periods also may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default 
significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which we may sell repossessed automobiles or delay the timing of these sales 
because c f finance focuses on non prime borrowers  the actual rates of delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses on these loans are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn 
while we manage the higher risk inherent in loans made to non prime borrowers through the underwriting criteria and collection methods employed by c f finance  we cannot guarantee that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks 
however  we believe that the current allowance for loan losses and the dealer reserves are adequate to absorb any losses on existing consumer finance segment loans that may become uncollectible 
we generally place loans at the retail banking  mortgage banking and consumer finance segments on non accrual status when the collection of principal or interest is days or more past due  or earlier  if collection is 
table of contents uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower 
loans greater than days past due may remain on accrual status if we determine we have adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest 
for those loans that are carried on non accrual status  payments are first applied to principal outstanding 
at the consumer finance segment  automobiles securing the loans are generally repossessed after a loan becomes more than days delinquent 
repossessions are handled by independent repossession firms engaged by c f finance and must be approved by a collections officer 
after any prescribed waiting period  the repossessed automobile is sold by a third party auctioneer 
c f finance does not sell any vehicles on a retail basis 
we credit the proceeds from the sale of the automobile at auction  and any other recoveries  against the balance of the loan 
auction proceeds from the sale of the repossessed vehicle and other recoveries are usually not sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the loan  and the resulting deficiency is charged off 
the charge off represents the difference between the actual net sale proceeds and the amount of the delinquent loan 
c f finance pursues collection of deficiencies when it deems such action to be appropriate 
for those loans that are carried on non accrual status  payments are first applied to principal balances outstanding 
we would have recorded additional gross interest income of  for   for and  for if non accrual loans had been current throughout these periods 
interest received on non accrual loans was  in   in and  in we measure impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due 
we maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
at december  the balances of impaired loans were million for and million for for which a specific valuation allowance of  at december  and  at december  was established 
the average balance of impaired loans was million for and million for we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 

table of contents financial condition summary a financial institution s primary sources of revenue are generated by its earning assets  while its major expenses are produced by the funding of those assets with interest bearing liabilities

at december   the corporation had total assets of million  up percent over the previous year end 
in  total assets increased million  or percent over year end asset growth in was principally a result of increases in loans held for sale and loans held for investment

these securities matured in the first quarter of  and  to the extent these funds were not used to fund the increase in loans held for sale  loans held for investment and additional securities purchases  they were held in the bank s overnight interest bearing account at the fhlb at december  asset growth in was principally attributable to increased interest bearing deposits in other banks and increased securities available for sale resulting from growth in deposits in excess of loan demand at the end of loan portfolio general through the retail banking segment  we engage in a wide range of lending activities  which include the origination  primarily in the banking segment s market area  of one to four family and multi family residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans  land acquisition and development loans  consumer loans and commercial business loans

residential mortgage lending held for sale the mortgage banking segment s guidelines for underwriting conventional conforming loans comply with the underwriting criteria established by fannie mae and or freddie mac 
the guidelines for conventional non conforming loans are based on the requirements of private investors and information provided by third party investors 
the guidelines used by c f mortgage to originate fha insured and va guaranteed loans comply with the criteria established by hud and the va 
the conventional loans that c f mortgage originates or purchases that have loan to value ratios greater than percent at origination are generally covered by private mortgage insurance 
the borrower pays the cost of the insurance 
residential mortgage lending held for investment the retail banking segment originates residential mortgage loans secured by properties located in its primary market area in southeastern and central virginia 
the bank offers various types of residential mortgage loans in addition to traditional long term  fixed rate loans 
such loans include and year amortizing mortgage loans with fixed rates of interest and fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of years but subject to call after five  seven or years at the option of the bank 
the bank underwrites the loans on terms consistent with pre existing secondary mortgage market standards 
loans associated with residential mortgage lending are included in the real estate residential mortgage category in table 
table of contents construction lending the retail banking segment has an active construction lending program 
the bank makes loans primarily for the construction of one to four family residences and  to a lesser extent  multi family dwellings 
the bank also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects  generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the bank 
the amounts  interest rates and terms for construction loans vary  depending upon market conditions  the size and complexity of the project  and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors of the loan 
the term for the bank s typical construction loan ranges from nine months to months for the construction of an individual residence and from months to a maximum of three years for larger residential or commercial projects 
the bank does not typically amortize its construction loans  and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
the bank s construction loans generally have a floating or variable rate of interest but occasionally have a fixed interest rate 
the bank does not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis 
for residential builder loans  the bank limits the number of models and or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions  the builder s financial strength and track record and other factors 
generally  the maximum loan to value ratio for one to four family residential construction loans is percent of the property s fair market value  or percent of the property s fair market value if the property will be the borrower s primary residence 
the fair market value of a project is determined on the basis of an appraisal of the project usually conducted by an independent  outside appraiser acceptable to the bank 
for larger projects where unit absorption or leasing is a concern  the bank may also obtain a feasibility study or other acceptable information from the borrower or other sources about the likely disposition of the property following the completion of construction 
construction loans for nonresidential projects and multi unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the bank than residential mortgage loans 
the bank attempts to minimize such risks by making construction loans in accordance with the bank s underwriting standards and to established customers in its primary market area and by monitoring the quality  progress and cost of construction 
the maximum loan to value ratio established by the bank for non residential projects and multi unit residential projects is percent  however  this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
loans associated with construction lending are included in the real estate construction category in table consumer lot lending consumer lot loans are loans made to individuals for the purpose of acquiring an unimproved building site for the construction of a residence that generally will be occupied by the borrower 
consumer lot loans are made only to individual borrowers  and each borrower generally must certify to the bank his intention to build and occupy a single family residence on the lot generally within three or five years of the date of origination of the loan 
these loans typically have a maximum term of either three or five years with a balloon payment of the entire balance of the loan being due in full at the end of the initial term 
the interest rate for these loans is fixed or variable at a rate that is slightly higher than prevailing rates for one to four family residential mortgage loans 
we do not believe consumer lot loans bear as much risk as land acquisition and development loans because such loans are not made for the construction of residences for immediate resale  are not made to developers and builders  and 
table of contents are not concentrated in any one subdivision or community 
beginning in  the bank began purchasing lot loans originated by c f mortgage 
these loans must satisfy the bank s underwriting criteria  including loan to value and credit score guidelines 
loans associated with consumer lot lending are included in the real estate construction category in table commercial real estate lending the bank s commercial real estate loans are primarily secured by the value of real property and the income arising from such property 
the proceeds of commercial real estate loans are generally used by the borrower to finance or refinance the cost of acquiring and or improving a commercial property 
the properties that typically secure these loans are office and warehouse facilities  hotels  retail facilities  restaurants and other commercial properties 
the bank s present policy is generally to restrict the making of commercial real estate loans to borrowers who will occupy or use the financed property in connection with their normal business operations 
however  the bank also will consider making commercial real estate loans under the following two conditions 
first  the bank will consider making commercial real estate loans for other purposes if the borrower is in strong financial condition and presents a substantial business opportunity for the bank 
second  the bank will consider making commercial real estate loans to creditworthy borrowers who have substantially pre leased the improvements to high caliber tenants 
the bank s commercial real estate loans are usually amortized over a period of time ranging from years to years and usually have a term to maturity ranging from five years to years 
these loans normally have provisions for interest rate adjustments after the loan is three to five years old 
the bank s maximum loan to value ratio for a commercial real estate loan is percent  however  this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
most commercial real estate loans are further secured by one or more unconditional personal guarantees 
in recent years  the bank has structured many of its commercial real estate loans as mini permanent loans 
the amortization period  term and interest rates for these loans vary based on borrower preferences and the bank s assessment of the loan and the degree of risk involved 
if the borrower prefers a fixed rate of interest  the bank usually offers a loan with a fixed rate of interest for a term of three to five years with an amortization period of up to years 
the remaining balance of the loan is due and payable in a single balloon payment at the end of the initial term 
in addition  the bank offers a fixed rate of interest for up to years for loans that fully amortize during the year term 
if the borrower prefers a variable or floating rate of interest  the bank usually offers a loan with an interest rate indexed to the bank s prime rate plus a margin for a term of five years with the remaining balance of the loan due and payable in a single balloon payment at the end of five years 
we believe that shorter maturities for commercial real estate loans are necessary to give the bank some protection from changes in the borrower s business and income as well as changes in general economic conditions 
in the case of fixed rate commercial real estate loans  shorter maturities also provide the bank with an opportunity to adjust the interest rate on this type of interest earning asset in accordance with the bank s asset and liability management strategies 
loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are usually dependent on successful operation or management of the properties securing such loans  repayment of such loans is subject to changes in both general and local economic conditions and the borrower s business and income 
as a result  events 
table of contents beyond the control of the bank  such as a downturn in the local economy  could adversely affect the performance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks by lending to established customers and generally restricting its commercial real estate loans to its primary market area 
emphasis is placed on the income producing characteristics and capacity of the collateral 
loans associated with commercial real estate lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table land acquisition and development lending land acquisition and development loans are made to builders and developers for the purpose of acquiring unimproved land to be developed for residential building sites  residential housing subdivisions  multi family dwellings and a variety of commercial uses 
the bank s policy is to make land acquisition loans to borrowers for the purpose of acquiring developed lots for single family  townhouse or condominium construction 
the bank will make both land acquisition and development loans to residential builders  experienced developers and others in strong financial condition to provide additional construction and mortgage lending opportunities for the bank 
the bank underwrites and processes land acquisition and development loans in much the same manner as commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans 
for land acquisition and development loans  the bank uses a lower loan to value ratio  which is a maximum of percent for unimproved land and percent of the discounted appraised value of the property as determined in accordance with the bank s appraisal policies for developed lots for single family or townhouse construction 
the bank can waive the maximum loan to value ratio for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
the term of land acquisition and development loans ranges from a maximum of two years for loans relating to the acquisition of unimproved land to  generally  a maximum of three years for other types of projects 
all land acquisition and development loans generally are further secured by one or more unconditional personal guarantees 
because these loans are usually in a larger amount and involve more risk than consumer lot loans  the bank carefully evaluates the borrower s assumptions and projections about market conditions and absorption rates in the community in which the property is located and the borrower s ability to carry the loan if the borrower s assumptions prove inaccurate 
loans associated with land acquisition and development lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table commercial business lending commercial business loan products include revolving lines of credit to provide working capital  term loans to finance the purchase of vehicles and equipment  letters of credit to guarantee payment and performance  and other commercial loans 
in general  these credit facilities carry the unconditional guaranty of the owners and or stockholders 
revolving and operating lines of credit are typically secured by all current assets of the borrower  provide for the acceleration of repayment upon any event of default  are monitored monthly or quarterly to ensure compliance with loan covenants  and are re underwritten or renewed annually 
interest rates generally will float at a spread tied to the bank s prime lending rate 
term loans are generally advanced for the purchase of  and are secured by  vehicles and equipment and are normally fully amortized over a term of two to five years  on either a fixed or floating rate basis 

table of contents loans associated with commercial business lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table home equity and second mortgage lending the bank offers its customers home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans that enable customers to borrow funds secured by the equity in their homes 
currently  home equity lines of credit are offered with adjustable rates of interest that are generally priced at the prime lending rate plus a spread 
second mortgage loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rates 
call option provisions are included in the loan documents for some longer term  fixed rate second mortgage loans  and these provisions allow the bank to make interest rate adjustments for such loans 
second mortgage loans are granted for a fixed period of time  usually between five and years  and home equity lines of credit are made on an open end  revolving basis 
home equity loans  second mortgage loans and other consumer loans secured by a personal residence generally do not present as much risk to the bank as other types of consumer loans 
beginning in  the bank began purchasing home equity lines of credit originated by c f mortgage 
these loans must satisfy the bank s underwriting criteria  including loan to value and credit score guidelines 
loans associated with home equity and second mortgage lending are included in the equity lines category in table consumer lending the bank offers a variety of consumer loans  including automobile  personal secured and personal unsecured  credit card  and loans secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit 
the shorter terms and generally higher interest rates on consumer loans help the bank maintain a profitable spread between its average loan yield and its cost of funds 
consumer loans secured by collateral other than a personal residence generally involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral or  in certain cases  the absence of collateral 
however  the bank believes the higher yields generally earned on such loans compensate for the increased credit risk associated with such loans 
loans associated with consumer lending are included in the consumer category in table automobile sales finance c f finance has an extensive automobile dealer network from which it buys automobile loan contracts through its branch offices 
branch personnel have a specific credit authority based upon their experience and historical loan portfolio results  as well as established underwriting criteria 
although the credit approval process is decentralized  c f finance s application processing system includes controls designed to ensure that credit decisions comply with its underwriting policies and procedures 
finance contract application packages completed by prospective borrowers are submitted by the automobile dealers electronically through a third party online automotive sales and finance platform to c f finance s automated origination and application scoring system  which processes the credit bureau report  
table of contents generates all relevant loan calculations and recommends the loan structure 
c f finance personnel with credit authority review the system generated recommendations and determine whether to approve or deny the application 
the credit decision is based primarily on the applicant s credit history with emphasis on prior auto loan history  current employment status  income  collateral type and mileage  and the loan to value ratio 
c f finance s underwriting and collateral guidelines form the basis for the credit decision 
exceptions to credit policies and authorities must be approved by a designated credit officer 
c f finance s typical borrowers have experienced prior credit difficulties or have modest income 
because c f finance serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources  we expect c f finance to sustain a higher level of credit losses than traditional automobile financing sources 
however  c f finance generally charges interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources 
these higher rates should more than offset the increase in the provision for loan losses for this segment of the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans associated with automobile sales finance are included in the consumer finance category in table securities the investment portfolio plays a primary role in the management of the corporation s interest rate sensitivity and generates substantial interest income 
in addition  the portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and is used as needed to meet collateral requirements 
the investment portfolio consists of securities available for sale  which may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the securities prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs and other similar factors

total deposits at december  increased million  or percent  over december  in  the changes by deposit category were a percent increase in non interest bearing deposits  a percent increase in savings and interest bearing demand deposits and a percent decrease in time deposits 
the increase in non interest bearing deposits resulted from the bank s efforts to attract these deposits through product offerings and an emphasis on obtaining transactional deposit accounts from its commercial customers 
in addition  the bank opened a branch in mechanicsville  virginia at the end of and a branch in newport news  virginia in january the decrease in time deposits can be attributed to investors preferring short term  no penalty deposits in order to maintain flexibility in their investing options as the value of the stock market improves

short term borrowings also include securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which are secured transactions with customers and generally mature the day following the day sold 
long term borrowings consist of advances from the fhlb and advances under a non recourse revolving bank line of credit  which were used to fund a portion of outstanding loans at c f finance 
fhlb advances are secured by a blanket floating lien on all qualifying real estate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties and by a blanket floating lien on all qualifying real estate mortgage loans secured by commercial properties 
the bank line of credit is non recourse and is secured by loans at c f finance 
during  the corporation had additional long term borrowings outstanding that were used to partially fund the acquisition of c f finance 
these borrowings consisted of million of subordinated notes to the previous owners of c f finance and a million loan from a third party financial institution 
these borrowings were repaid in utilizing a portion of the corporation s excess liquidity because they carried interest rates of percent and percent  respectively

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements to meet the financing needs of customers  the corporation is a party  in the normal course of business  to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commitments to sell loans and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in addition to the amount on the balance sheet 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
we obtain collateral based on our credit assessment of the customer in each circumstance 
loan commitments are agreements to extend credit to a customer provided that there are no violations of the terms of the contract prior to funding 
commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer 
since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the total amount of loan commitments was million at december  and million at december  standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
the total contract amount of standby letters of credit  whose contract amounts represent credit risk  was million at december  and million at december  at december   c f mortgage had rate lock commitments to originate mortgage loans amounting to million and loans held for sale of million 
c f mortgage has entered into corresponding mandatory commitments  on a best efforts basis  to sell loans of million 
these commitments to sell loans are designed to eliminate c f mortgage s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in connection with rate lock commitments and loans held for sale 
c f mortgage sells substantially all of the residential mortgage loans it originates to third party investors  some of whom require the repurchase of loans in the event of early default or faulty documentation 
mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are sold under agreements that define certain eligibility criteria for the mortgage loans 
recourse periods vary from days up to one year and conditions for repurchase vary with the investor 
mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single family residences and generally either have loan to value ratios of percent or less or have private mortgage insurance or are insured or guaranteed by an agency of the us government 
we include recourse considerations in our calculation of the corporation s capital adequacy 
payments made under these recourse provisions were  in   in and  in risks also arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
c f mortgage has procedures in place to evaluate the credit risk of investors and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations

liquidity the objective of the corporation s liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to satisfy the credit needs of our customers and the demands of our depositors  creditors and investors 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position are the current components of a solid foundation for the corporation s liquidity position 
additional sources of liquidity available to the corporation include cash flows from operations  such as loan payments and payoffs and deposit growth  and the capacity to borrow additional funds 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits at other banks and nonpledged securities available for sale  totaled million at december  the corporation s funding sources consist of an established federal funds line with a regional correspondent bank that had no outstanding balance under a total line of million as of december   an established line with the fhlb that had million outstanding under a total line of million as of december  and a revolving line of credit with a third party bank that had million outstanding under a total line of million as of december  we have no reason to believe these arrangements will not be renewed at maturity

as a result of the corporation s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  we believe that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy the corporation s operational requirements and contractual obligations 

table of contents capital resources the assessment of capital adequacy depends on such factors as asset quality  liquidity  earnings performance  and changing competitive conditions and economic forces

fin provides guidance with respect to the identification of variable interest entities when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
an entity is deemed a variable interest entity  subject to the interpretation  if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or in cases in which the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  which include the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur

in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs in exchange for goods or services liabilities that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its the award s current fair value  the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
sfas r is effective for the corporation as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  under the transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosure required for those periods by sfas we will begin recognizing compensation expense in the third quarter of for options that have been issued but not yet vested prior to july  we project the compensation expense associated with adopting sfas r will approximate  in and  in this estimate applies only to options issued but not yet vested prior to july  options issued after the effective date will increase compensation expense above these estimates for and options approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors and issued in december were granted with a six month vesting period 
the effect of the six month vesting is disclosed in the pro forma earnings per share calculations in note of the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
this vesting 
table of contents period was determined as part of a broad review of long term incentive compensation in light of changes in market practice and changes in accounting rules 
the issuance of sfas r allowed only a very limited period for evaluating the corporation s compensation plans and we believe the decision for a six month vesting period on options granted in december was in the best interest of the corporation and the shareholders 
we will continue reviewing the effects of sfas r and its impact on compensation plans throughout the corporation 
effects of inflation the effect of changing prices is typically different for financial institutions than for other entities because a financial institution s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
interest rates are significantly impacted by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes is directly related to price level indices 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the impacts of inflation on interest rates  loan demands and deposits 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management as the holding company for a commercial bank  the corporation s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately affect the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of the corporation s assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those that possess a short term to maturity 
based on the nature of the corporation s operations  it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the retail banking loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the virginia counties of king william  king and queen  hanover  henrico  chesterfield  middlesex  new kent  charles city  york  and james city  and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with these local economies 
the consumer finance loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in eastern  central and southwest virginia and portions of tennessee and maryland and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with these local economies 
as of december   the corporation does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps or caps 
we enter into rate lock commitments  under which the corporation  through the mortgage banking segment  originates residential mortgage loans with interest rates determined prior to funding 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that we intend to sell in the secondary market are considered derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from days to days 
for these rate lock commitments  we protect the corporation from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments  whereby the corporation commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan 
as a result  the corporation is not exposed to losses nor will it realize gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate management strategy is designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model that measures the sensitivity of future net interest income and the net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we monitor the corporation s interest rate sensitivity through analysis  measuring the terms to maturity or the next repricing date of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of the maturities of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income 
in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater decrease in the yield on interest earning assets relative to the cost of its liabilities and thus a decrease in net interest income 
an institution with a negative gap would be expected to experience the opposite results 

table of contents certain shortcomings are inherent in any method of analysis used to estimate a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the analysis is based at a given point in time and does not take into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities also may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on loans with call features may or may not change depending on their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
the corporation also is subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the level of prepayments of loans  which may also affect the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position 
the methodologies used for interest rate management estimate various rates of withdrawal for money market deposits  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
as part of the corporation s borrowings  we may utilize  from time to time  daily  convertible  fixed and adjustable rate advances from the fhlb 
convertible advances generally provide for a fixed rate of interest for a portion of the term of the advance  for a conversion feature that enables the fhlb to convert the advance from a fixed rate to an adjustable rate at some predetermined time during the remaining term of the advance  and a concurrent opportunity for the corporation to prepay the advance with no prepayment penalty in the event the fhlb elects to exercise the conversion feature 
the interest rates paid on borrowings with convertible features may or may not change depending on their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
also  the corporation has an adjustable rate revolving line of credit with a third party bank that partially funds the lending activities of c f finance 
table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are subject to repricing or that mature in each of the time periods shown 
in addition  loans  securities and borrowings with call or convertible provisions are included in the period in which they may first be called 
except as stated above  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability

we believe that the assumptions utilized are reasonable 
we calculated the expected maturity date values for loans by adjusting the instruments contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes 
similarly  we calculated expected maturity date values for interest bearing core deposits based on estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  as set forth in the notes 
from a risk management perspective  however  we utilize both maturity and repricing dates  as opposed to solely using expected maturity dates as shown in table changes in the maturities of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities in  as shown in table  that are attributable to factors other than overall growth are as follow the increase in loans held for sale maturing within one year is a result of production at c f mortgage in the later part of the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in all loans originated at c f mortgage are usually sold within one month of loan closing 
the decrease in securities maturing within one year and the increase in the corresponding yield is a result of the year end deployment of excess liquidity from overnight interest bearing accounts into short term investments 
the increase in borrowings and the corresponding cost of funds resulted from c f finance s loan growth  which was partially funded through a variable rate revolving line of credit 
the increase in yields on earnings assets reflected the impact of the increases in short term interest rates during the second half of we believe that our current interest rate exposure is manageable and does not indicate any significant exposure to interest rate changes 
although table shows a negative cumulative gap for the one year time period  a large portion of the interest bearing liabilities repricing is based on broad assumptions 
in addition  although these liabilities are subject to repricing  historically the repricing lags the changes in short term interest rates
