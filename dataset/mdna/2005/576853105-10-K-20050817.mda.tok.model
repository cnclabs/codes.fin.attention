item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap critical accounting policies revenue recognition matrix service records profits on long term contracts on a percentage of completion basis on the cost to cost method 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
matrix service includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix service determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix service has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
matrix service has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contracts costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts  and adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period when estimable or finalized  which is generally during the latter stages of the contract 
contract incentives are evaluated throughout the life of the contract and are recognized on a percentage of completion basis when the likelihood of obtaining the incentive becomes probable 
indirect costs such as salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs and insurance costs are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour 
warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred 
warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented 
overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred 
matrix service records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts based on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred 

table of contents claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us 
recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
we must determine if there is a legal basis for the claim  the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if all of these requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim 
as of may  and may   accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues  to the extent of costs incurred  for unapproved change orders of approximately million and million  respectively  and claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
historically  our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized 
the following table provides a rollforward of revenue recognized on claims and unapproved change orders 
amounts disclosed for unapproved change orders exclude amounts associated with contract disputes disclosed in note contract disputes 
claims for unapproved change orders other claims total in thousands balance at may  additions collections gain loss balance at may  additions collections gain loss balance at may  contract dispute receivables contract dispute receivables are comprised of accounts receivable and cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings for which settlement is subject to legal proceedings such as mediation  arbitration or litigation 
such proceedings have resulted in delays in obtaining resolution 
as a result  the balances are presented separately on the balance sheet at estimated net realizable value based upon the most current information available 
amounts ultimately received may differ from the current estimate 

table of contents loss contingencies various legal actions  claims  and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or are otherwise disclosed  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we use a case basis evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known 
we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
purchase price allocation the purchase price for an acquisition is allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition 
we record the excess of purchase price over fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
the fair value of net assets is primarily based upon estimated future cash flows associated with the net assets 
accordingly  our post acquisition financial statements are materially impacted by and dependent on the accuracy of management s fair value estimates at the time of acquisition 
our experience has been that the most significant of these estimates relate to the values assigned to construction contracts in progress and production backlog 
these estimates can have a positive or negative material effect on future reported operating results 
debt covenant compliance we have certain financial covenants we are required to maintain under our credit facility 
in the event of a financial covenant violation that is not appropriately waived by the lenders  or otherwise cured  re payment of borrowings under the credit facility could be accelerated 
additionally  if a covenant violation has occurred or would have occurred absent a loan modification  borrowings will be classified as current if it is probable that we will not maintain covenant compliance within the next twelve months 
in this event  we are required to develop financial projections that allow us to assess the probability of whether or not we will be in covenant compliance for the subsequent month period from the balance sheet date 
key assumptions utilized in the projections include estimated timing of the award and performance of work  estimated cash flows and estimated borrowing levels 
these projections represent our best estimate of our operating results and financial condition for the subsequent month period 
as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  the current bank group has amended our credit agreement and provided waivers for specified covenant violations 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
as of may  and may   insurance reserves totaling million and million  respectively  are reflected on our balance sheet 
these amounts represent our best estimate of our ultimate obligations for asserted claims plus claims incurred but not yet reported at the balance sheet date 
we establish specific reserves for claims using case basis evaluations of the underlying claim data and update our evaluations as further information becomes known 
judgments and assumptions are inherent in our reserve accruals  as a result  changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future 
additionally  the actual results of claim settlements could differ from the amounts estimated 

table of contents goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment calculations are our reportable segments 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
judgments and assumptions related to revenue  gross margins  operating expenses  interest  capital expenditures  cash flow and market assumptions are inherent in these estimates 
as a result  use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and ultimately results in the recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements 
we utilize various assumption scenarios and assign probabilities to each of these scenarios in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it would negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised sfas no 
 share based payment 
the statement requires that compensation costs for all share based awards to employees be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
the statement  as issued by the fasb  was to be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  however  on april   the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a new rule which amends the compliance dates for revised sfas no 
the rule allows implementation of the statement at the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after june  we intend to adopt the revised statement in the first quarter of fiscal we are also studying the provisions of this new pronouncement to determine the impact on our financial statements

table of contents results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  construction services and repair and maintenance services 
the majority of the work for both segments is performed in the united states with only a minimal amount occurring in canada 
the construction services segment includes turnkey and specialty construction services provided primarily to the downstream petroleum and power industries 
these services include civil structural  mechanical  piping  electrical and instrumentation  millwrighting  steel fabrication and erection  specialized heavy hauling and rigging  boiler work  engineering  and fabrication and construction of aboveground storage tanks 
the repair and maintenance services segment provides routine  preventive and emergency required maintenance and repair services primarily to the downstream petroleum and power industries 
these services include plant turnarounds  power outages  industrial cleaning  facility and ast maintenance and repair 
significant fluctuations in revenues  gross profits and operating results are discussed below on a consolidated basis and for each segment 
our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to many factors  including the changing product mix and project schedules  which are dependent on the level and timing of customer releases of new business 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million for fiscal the decrease in consolidated revenues resulted from a million decrease in construction services revenues partially offset by a million increase in repair and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal this decline of million  or  in gross profit resulted primarily from the decline in revenues 
consolidated gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the decline in construction services revenue  which led to a smaller consolidated revenue base available to absorb fixed costs 
also negatively impacting margins  was the partial replacement of construction revenues coming in the form of low margin repair and maintenance work 
consolidated sg a expenses were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase of million was primarily attributable to an additional million contract dispute reserve recorded in the third quarter of fiscal for the previously disclosed contract disputes as a result of the company s effort to accelerate the collection of amounts owed in order to help alleviate the company s liquidity situation 
the table below provides an analysis of sg a and other charges in fiscal partially offsetting these expenses were cost reduction strategies implemented in both the first and fourth quarters of fiscal and a reduction in employee incentives  which are based on attainment of financial goals 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year as a result of a decrease in revenues combined with the contract dispute reserve adjustment and the other additional sg a charges noted in the table below 
restructuring  impairment and abandonment charges of million in fiscal consisted mainly of an impairment of goodwill with the remaining difference primarily related to restructuring charges which are both noted in the table below 
interest expense increased to million during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal due to higher interest rates  amortization of credit facility amendment fees and the increased level of debt that resulted from collection issues and contract disputes  which carried over from fiscal 
table of contents income before income tax expense decreased from million in fiscal to a loss before income tax of million during fiscal this million decrease was due to a combination of lower gross margins resulting from the decline in consolidated revenues  an adjustment to the contract dispute reserve  impairment of goodwill and higher interest expense 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the unusually low effective tax rate in fiscal is attributable to the absence of a tax benefit for the impairment of goodwill  combined with establishing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of approximately million

construction services construction services revenues during fiscal were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from the power industry  which resulted from the completion of two large power projects performed by our eastern operations in fiscal partially offsetting this decline was revenue from other industries  which increased million  and downstream petroleum industries  which increased million 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal  a decrease of  resulting primarily from the decrease in the volume of business 
construction services gross margins declined from in fiscal to during fiscal due to a lower revenue base available for fixed cost absorption  and primarily due to decreases resulting from three loss projects in the western business unit 
last year s margins were also impacted by two low margin power projects completed at the end of fiscal the operating loss and loss before income tax expense for fiscal of million and million  respectively  compared unfavorably to operating income and income before income tax expense of million and million  respectively  produced during fiscal this was due to the sharp decline in revenues  higher interest expense  an additional contract dispute reserve and the impairment of goodwill 

table of contents repair and maintenance services revenues from repair and maintenance services increased million  or  from million during fiscal  to million in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily from increased revenues from the downstream petroleum industry  which increased million as a result of strong turnaround activity combined with the addition of maintenance contracts entered into in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  revenues from the power industry increased million  while other industries declined million 
gross margins of for fiscal were lower than gross margins of in fiscal  despite the increase in revenues  as a result of a large presence of low margin maintenance projects  a number of which have subsequently been exited 
gross profit remained consistent for both fiscal years at million despite increased revenues  due to the presence of lower margin projects 
operating income and income before income tax expense for fiscal of million and million  respectively  were lower than the operating income and income before income tax expense of million and million  respectively  produced in fiscal this decline was primarily due to increased sg a and restructuring costs combined with higher interest expense 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million during fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million for fiscal this increase in consolidated revenues resulted from a million increase in construction services revenues  combined with a million increase in repair and maintenance services revenues 
these increases were primarily due to the inclusion of the hake acquisition for only one quarter in fiscal  as compared to the full year in fiscal consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal this increase of million  or  in gross profit was a direct result of the increase in revenues  partially offset by lower margin work in the mix of business 
consolidated gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the inclusion of lower margin work in the mix of business particularly on large power projects 
consolidated sg a expenses were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal the majority of this million increase was attributable to the added overhead resulting from the acquisition of hake 
in addition  fiscal included million legal expense related to contract disputes along with million for sarbanes oxley compliance work 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal  compared to in the prior fiscal year as a result of leveraging the fixed cost structure with the hake acquisition  which spread these costs over a larger revenue base 
in addition  there were charges of approximately million in fiscal related to the integration of hake 
restructuring  impairment and abandonment gain of million in fiscal consisted mainly of a one time insurance settlement of million from a recovery under matrix service s environmental insurance policy of expenditures made to remediate previously owned properties in newnan  georgia  as well as a million reduction in workers compensation reserves related to exited operation 
interest expense increased to million during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a result of increased debt that occurred due to the acquisition of hake  increased working capital needs  and collection delays resulting from collection issues and contract disputes 
income before income tax expense increased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal this million increase was due to a higher volume of business creating better margins partially offset by a combination of greater fixed costs related to the acquisition of hake  and higher interest expenses due to increased level of debt 

table of contents the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the increased effective tax rate in fiscal is due to the company s federal tax rate increasing  the generation of more income in states with higher tax rates and the realization of permanent tax credits in the third quarter of fiscal construction services construction services revenues during fiscal were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from the power industry  which resulted primarily from the realization of low margin projects due to the hake acquisition 
adding to this increase was revenue from both other industries  which increased million  and downstream petroleum industries  which increased million 
construction services gross margins declined from in fiscal  to during fiscal as a result of lower margin hake work in the mix of business  particularly on large power projects 
also  cost overruns  overruns by subcontractors to the company  contract disputes and a bankrupt customer all contributed to the lower margins realized on the hake work 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal  an increase of resulting primarily from the increase in the volume of business  offset by the inclusion of lower margin work 
the operating income and income before income tax expense for fiscal of million and million  respectively  were higher than the operating income and income before income tax expense of million and million  respectively  produced during fiscal  due to increased revenues  partially offset by declining margins 
repair and maintenance services revenues from repair and maintenance services increased million  or  from million during fiscal  to million in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily from increased revenues from the downstream petroleum industry  which increased million 
in addition  revenues from the power industry and other industries increased million and million  respectively 
this overall increase is a direct result of the inclusion of hake revenues for the full year in fiscal  versus only the fourth quarter in fiscal gross margins of for fiscal were lower than the gross margins of in fiscal due primarily to the inclusion of lower margin hake repair and maintenance work and lower margins on routine repair and maintenance activities as a result of lower demand in the first half of fiscal the lower margins on the hake repair and maintenance activity resulted from the strategic decision to take a large turnaround project in the second quarter with a new customer at very low gross margins 
the increased volume of business  partially offset by the decline in margins produced gross profit in fiscal of million  a increase from the million reported for fiscal operating income and income before income tax expense for fiscal of million and million  respectively  were more than the operating income and income before income tax expense of million and million  respectively  produced in fiscal primarily due to higher volume of business in fiscal outlook fiscal will be a transition year with the emphasis on executing our work profitably  reducing our risk profile  improving margins and completing our restructuring and refinancing efforts 
in march  the company initiated a restructuring program to reduce its cost structure and improve its operating results 
the company focused on its core strengths and identified those areas with the objective of eliminating unprofitable and marginal work 
as a result of this effort  matrix sold the transportation and rigging assets and has executed a letter of intent to sell the aluminum floating roof business 
matrix is also in the process of selling excess facilities or land in tulsa  oklahoma  orange  california  and holmes  pennsylvania 
these liquidity events  coupled with various tax refunds is expected to yield approximately million in cash  which will be used to improve liquidity 
matrix also ceased to work on a number of large routine maintenance contracts that were utilizing valuable resources while providing minimal returns 
as these maintenance contracts were reduced  there was a significant reduction of overhead and administration costs 
as a result of these efforts and other efforts to reduce costs  matrix was able to reduce its annual administrative payroll and benefit costs by more than million 
we are not in a position at this point of the company s turnaround to provide meaningful guidance except to say that we anticipate a profitable year with results improving as the year progresses 
we are hopeful that the disputed receivables will be resolved by the end of fiscal which  when coupled with the planned liquidity events discussed earlier and cash flow from operations  would allow us to be in a position to pay off most  if not all  of our bank debt 

table of contents fiscal has been a difficult year and one we would rather not repeat 
the changes we have made in late fiscal and continuing in the first half of fiscal will  however  put the company in a position to return to profitable growth 
non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measure 
ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of operations entitled net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use  and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information compared with net income loss  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions  which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes taxes has material limitations 
it does not include depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 
ebitda for the year ended may  was a million loss  compared to a positive million and million for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss follows for the year ended may  may  may  in thousands net income loss interest expense  net provision benefit for income taxes   a  a depreciation and amortization ebitda a provision for income taxes for the year ended may  and included and  respectively  of taxes related to net earnings of joint venture 
the million decrease in ebitda for the year ended may   as compared to the prior year  was primarily due to an impairment charge of million  a contract dispute reserve of million incurred during the third quarter of fiscal and higher sg a and restructuring expenses 
in addition  operating results  primarily in the construction services segment  were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents financial condition and liquidity our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million at may  and million at may  our operations provided million of cash for the twelve months ended may   as compared with using million of cash for the twelve months ended may   representing an increase of approximately million 
the increase was primarily due to increased amounts owed to vendors and increased billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings to customers 
these increases were partially offset by increased accounts receivable 
at fiscal year end  our debt consisted of the following may  in thousands borrowings under bank credit facility revolving credit facility term note interest rate swap liability convertible notes less current portion revolving credit facility term note interest rate swap liability long term debt matrix service believes that its existing funds  amounts available from borrowing under its existing credit agreement  cash generated by operations  cash generated from the sale of non core assets and our anticipated refinancing of the senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet the working capital needs through fiscal and for the foreseeable time thereafter unless significant expansions of operations not now planned are undertaken  in which case matrix service would need to arrange additional financing as a part of any such expansion 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in refinancing our senior credit facility  or in obtaining alternative financing 
credit agreement and revolving credit facility on march   we replaced our prior credit agreement with an million senior credit facility entered into with a group of banks 
the credit agreement originally consisted of a five year term loan of million and a three year million revolving credit facility 
substantially all of our properties and assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries secure the senior credit facility 
under the original agreement  we paid libor based interest on funds borrowed under the term loan and funds borrowed on a revolving basis bore interest on a prime or libor based option 
in august  the senior credit facility was amended to convert million of the revolver balance to a term loan term loan b and to reduce the credit commitment on the revolver by an equal amount from million to million 
the facility was further amended in december to provide that interest on term loan b would accrue at a per annum fixed rate from november  until march   when the interest rate increased to an per annum fixed rate 
the interest rate was scheduled to further increase to a per annum fixed rate on june  in april  the company issued million of convertible debt notes and term loan b was paid in full 
at that time  the credit agreement was amended to limit availability under the primary revolver to the lesser of million or of the borrowing base 
the amendment also established a million revolving loan b commitment 
the revolving loan b commitment bears cash interest at prime  had an original maturity of october  and is secured by various contract dispute receivables 
availability under the commitment is limited to million less an amount equal to the value of all of our outstanding checks 
the revolving loan b commitment will be further reduced by an amount equal to any funds collected with respect to large disputed accounts 
in addition  the revolving b borrowing base and  consequently  the revolving b loan commitment  may be decreased by the revolver b lenders in their sole discretion 
in august  the senior credit facility was amended amendment ten to extend both revolving loan commitments to june  our credit agreement requires us to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances  including upon the sale of certain assets in excess of  the sale of stock or the issuance of subordinated indebtedness  or in the event that we generate excess cash  incur a borrowing base deficiency or collect contract dispute receivables 

table of contents amendment ten to our credit agreement modified the required financial covenants 
under amendment ten  we are required to maintain minimum levels of augmented consolidated ebitda for various quarterly test periods through may  as of designated quarterly test dates 
the starting point for the augmented consolidated ebitda is consolidated ebitda  which is defined to include consolidated net income  plus  to the extent deducted in determining consolidated net income  i consolidated interest expense ii expense for taxes paid or accrued  iii depreciation and amortization  iv up to  in the aggregate of the following a specifically defined professional and consulting fees other expenses related to the reorganization of borrower s fabrication operation  lease termination cost arising from the termination of leases occurring as a part of and during the restructure  and costs and expenses related to the search for a replacement chief executive officer but only to the extent paid or incurred on or before november   b severance payments and retention bonuses associated with restructuring  c legal fees and legal expenses incurred with regard to the enforcement and collection of the large disputed accounts  d losses on sales of fixed assets approved by the lenders and incurred prior to november   and e losses arising from the settlement of large disputed accounts minus  to the extent included in consolidated net income  i gains on sales of fixed assets  ii extraordinary gains realized other than in the ordinary course of business  and iii income tax benefits 
the minimum level of augmented consolidated ebitda for each quarterly test period is as follows test periods minimum augmented consolidated ebitda test date june  through august   september  june  through november   december  june  through february   march  june  through may   june  for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant  consolidated ebitda is increased by an amount equal to the lesser of i  or ii the sum of the following a if one or more sales of assets approved by the lenders has occurred  then the aggregate for all such sales of the following the amount  if any  by which an amount equal to the borrowing base immediately after the closing of such sale minus the aggregate principal balance of the revolving loans measured immediately after the application of such proceeds exceeds  an amount equal to the borrowing base immediately prior to the closing of such sales minus the aggregate principal balance of the revolving loans measured immediately prior to the application of such proceeds  b federal and state tax refunds received during such period less the amount of any taxes paid  c reimbursements received during such period from customers for capital expenditures associated with the lng project to the extent that  during the same period  such capital expenditures actually occurred  and d cash proceeds received during such period from the sale of any common stock  preferred stock  warrant or other equity other than the exercise of stock options by employees  officers and directors approved by the lenders and from the issuance of any subordinated indebtedness approved by the lenders 
amendment ten also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of augmented consolidated ebitda for the fiscal year to date minus cash dividends and distributions made or paid during the period to scheduled current maturities of the term loan for the fiscal year to date  plus scheduled current maturities of the hake group acquisition payable for the fiscal year to date  plus consolidated interest expense for the year to date excluding amounts included in consolidated interest expense for amortization of deferred financing fees amortization of prepaid interest related to the subordinated debt  accretion related to the hake group acquisition payable  and interest attributable to the additional accrued margin that is neither paid for nor due and payable during the fiscal year to date  plus current maturities on capitalized leases for the fiscal year to date and capital expenditures paid during such fiscal year to such date 
the ratio at each quarterly measurement date shall be less than amendment ten also requires us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda for the fiscal year to date minus cash dividends and distributions during the period to scheduled current maturities of the term loan for the fiscal year to date  plus scheduled current maturities of the hake group acquisition payable for the fiscal year to date  plus consolidated interest expense for the year to date excluding amounts described above  plus current maturities on capitalized leases for the fiscal year to date 
the required debt service coverage ratio is for the period ended august   for the period ending november   for the period ending february  and for the period ending may  amendment ten provides that borrowings under the revolver and the term loan shall bear prime based interest plus a margin 
the agreement further provides for an additional accrued margin that is paid upon termination of the facility 
the amendment provides for cash pay interest at a rate of prime plus and accrued interest at at beginning april and escalating fifty basis points monthly until december  at which time the accrued margin is 
beginning january  to january   cash pay interest converts to prime plus with accrued interest at on both revolvers and the term loan 
beginning february  to february   cash pay interest converts to prime plus with accrued interest at on both revolvers 
beginning march  to march  cash pay interest converts to prime plus with accrued interest at on both revolvers 
after april   cash pay interest converts to prime plus on both revolvers 
we were paying a weighted average interest rate of on the term loan and the revolver at may  
table of contents on august   the lenders executed a waiver which modified the required covenants at may   to require i consolidated ebitda as defined to be greater than or equal to  and ii a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined to be greater than or equal to 
the following table presents the required and actual financial covenant measures in effect as of may  fixed charge ratio minimum ratio required actual ratio excess shortfall ebitda in thousands minimum ebitda required actual ebitda excess shortfall at may   million was outstanding under the revolver and million was outstanding under the five year term loan 
there were no borrowings under revolver b 
in addition  million of the revolver was utilized by outstanding letters of credit  which automatically renew annually 
at may   remaining availability under the credit facility consisted of million available under the primary revolver and million under revolver b 
at august   availability under our primary revolver was million and million under revolver b 
the credit agreement also limits our capital expenditures to million annually  limits unsecured indebtedness we may borrow for general operating purposes to million  limits capital lease obligations to million and limits the amount of letters of credit we may have outstanding to million 
although our credit agreement provides us with sufficient liquidity for the upcoming fiscal year  the revolving loan b and the million revolver expire on june  furthermore  revolving loan b may be reduced at the lenders sole discretion 
while we are currently working to obtain a new credit facility  we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful 
in addition  the failure to comply with the terms of our credit agreement has required us to incur significant fees to our lenders to obtain waivers and amendments and caused us to seek alternative financing

foreign currency risk matrix service has a subsidiary whose operations are located in canada  whose functional currency is the local currency 
historically  movements in the foreign currency exchange rate have not significantly impacted results 
however  this does have the potential to impact the company s financial position  due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the us dollar 
management has not entered into derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency risk 
a change in the respective functional currency against the us dollar would not have had a material impact on the financial results of the company for the year ended may  commodity risk steel and steel pipe are the primary raw materials used by our construction services and repair and maintenance services segments 
supplies of these materials are available throughout the united states 
we do not anticipate being unable to obtain adequate amounts of these materials in the foreseeable future 
however  the availability and pricing of these materials could change significantly due to various factors  including producer capacity  the level of foreign imports  demand for the materials  the imposition or removal of tariffs on imported steel and other market conditions 
we mitigate these risks by including standard language in all of our contracts  which passes the risk of increases in steel prices or unavailability of steel on to our customers
