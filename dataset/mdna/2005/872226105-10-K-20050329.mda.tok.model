gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased in both the mechanical and electronics businesses due to the changes in volume and pricing described above  together with the affect of lower absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses related to the lower level of manufacturing operations 
this was particularly true in the company s mechanical business 
gross profits of the mechanical business declined approximately million principally due to actual volume declines  while the electronic business gross profit declined million  principally reflecting ongoing market pressure on pricing

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note to the attached consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgement by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates 
these judgements are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include product warranty in the ordinary course of business  the company warrants its products against defect in design  materials  and workmanship over various time periods 
warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is established based upon management s best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is not significant to the financial position of the company for all periods presented 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the last in first out basis for a majority of us inventories and the first in first out method for all remaining inventories 
the company has recorded a reserve for obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the realizable value of long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  relying on a number of factors including operating results  budgets  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
the company s past business acquisitions resulted in the recognition of goodwill  which may result in future impairment expenses 
the company s other intangible assets which primarily consist of product application software  affects the amount of future period amortization expense 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements issued by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company establishes allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts  sales discounts  product warranty  and returns based upon historical experience 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included as a component of net sales 
postretirement benefit obligation the company  in consultation with an actuarial firm specializing in the valuation of postretirement benefit obligations  selects certain actuarial assumptions to base the actuarial valuation of such obligations on  such as the discount rate interest rate used to determine present value of obligations payable in the future  initial health care cost trend rate  the ultimate cost care trend rate  and mortality tables to determine the expected future mortality of plan participants 
to the extent that the actual rates and mortality vary from the assumptions used to determine the present actuarial valuation of these postretirement benefits  additional provision for expense may be necessary 
income taxes under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company has not recognized any income tax benefit related to the income tax losses incurred by its mexican subsidiary currently because there is uncertainty as to whether that subsidiary will realize those benefits in the future 
as the mexican subsidiary realizes these income tax benefits in the future  a reduction of income taxes will be recognized 
management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  which  if actual experience varies  could result in material adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources the company s contractual obligations as of december  are as follows s less more contractual obligations in than than thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations     capitalized lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   total      at december  current and long term debt totaled million  compared to million at january   and was comprised of million in revolving debt under a secured revolving credit facility  million in tax exempt revenue bonds  million of a foreign revolving and term credit and million of other long term financing 
the company s effective borrowing rate at december  for its long term obligations was approximately 
on january   the company entered into a loan and security agreement the agreement that provides for up to an million revolving line of credit and two term loans term loan a and term loan b totaling million 
the proceeds were used to retire amounts outstanding under the company s outstanding revolving line of credit as well as fund existing letters of credit that support million of industrial revenue bonds and certain obligations under various self insured workers compensation insurance policies 
the term of the agreement is two years and the loans are secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets and pledges of of the outstanding stock of the company s canadian  german and mexican subsidiaries 
the revolving credit portion of the agreement is governed by a borrowing base formula and bears a variable interest of libor plus 
the term loans  which are repayable in monthly principal installments totaling million  bear interest at a variable rate of libor plus 
the average borrowing rate under the company s revolving line of credit arrangement in was 
had the agreement been in place at december   the remaining borrowing capacity available to the company would have been approximately million  after taking into consideration the costs of the transaction 
the agreement contains restrictive financial covenants that require the company to comply with certain financial tests including  among other things  maintaining minimum tangible net worth  having a minimum earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda  and meeting certain specified leverage and operating ratios  all as defined in the agreement 
the agreement also contains other restrictive covenants that restrict outside investments  capital expenditures  and dividends 
while the company was in compliance with the debt covenants at december   the limitation on dividends is such that the second quarter dividend for would be the earliest dividend that could be declared 
the company has generated positive cash flows from operations in each of the last five years 
during  the company generated million cash from operating activities  which compares to million for the same period in the prior year 
the primary reason for this fluctuation was reduced investment in net operating assets offset by lower cash generated by operating results in compared to in the company targeted inventory reduction as a primary objective following the successful transition of production at its closed trenton facility to other manufacturing operations 
the company s total working capital was million at december   compared to million on january  this reduction was caused by the classification of million of revolving indebtedness as a current liability under the terms of the agreement  together with the reduced investment in operating assets referred to above the company used million and million for investing activities during the years ended december  and january   respectively 
this spending was primarily for capital expenditures of million in and million in the company s capital investments have been at maintenance levels to support new product introductions  improve product quality  and reduce operating costs 
the company believes that the million annual capital expenditure level permitted by its new borrowing agreement will be sufficient to fund targeted investment projects for the amount of commitments for capital expenditures at december  was not significant 
cash used in financing activities increased to million in compared to million in the prior year as the company reduced amounts borrowed under its revolving credit line by approximately million due to lower working capital financing needs 
in  the company increased its borrowings by approximately million to finance its operations  including the funding of the investment in inventory needed to support the transition of certain manufacturing activities 
in addition  required additional financing to support a stock repurchase and higher level of dividends 
dividends paid in were million compared to dividends paid in of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company suspended its dividend pending the negotiation of its new credit facility  which contains certain terms that restrict future dividends 
the company s ongoing ability to declare and pay dividends is ultimately dependent upon its ability to operate at profitable levels and demonstrate compliance with its new revolving credit and term loan agreement 
the effects of foreign currency translations lessened during compared to as the united states dollar stabilized over most of the year compared to the prior year  particularly relative to values of the euro and the canadian dollar 
the effect of changes in foreign currency rates increased cash by million in compared to million in which reflected significant dollar declines 
as a result of all of the above items  the company experienced a net decrease of cash of million in compared to an increase in cash of million in the prior year 
the company believes that the combination of cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the company s operations for the foreseeable future

to the provision within the american job creations act of the act that provides tax relief to us domestic manufacturers 
the fsp states that the manufacturers deduction provided for under the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with statement and not as a tax rate reduction 
this fsp had no effect upon the company s consolidated financial statements for and the company is not yet able to determine the effect it will have in future years because the effect is dependent upon the company qualifying for this deduction 
in december  the fasb issued staff position fs fas accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american job creations act of effective upon issuance 
this fsp provides guidance on the application of a special limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer 
because of the effective foreign income tax rates of countries from which foreign earnings might be repatriated  this provision is not expected to provide any benefit to the company and as a result the company does not believe it will have any effect upon its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
revised share based payment a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
the effective date of this revised accounting standard is for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  in fiscal the company adopted fasb statement no 
to account for stock based compensation cost using the fair value method 
as the company has already adopted fasb statement no 
the only effects of the revised statement no

inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage

the statement introduces the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
the company is not yet able to determine the effect of this statement upon its consolidated financial statements because the impact is dependent upon production levels attained during a given financial reporting period compared to the normal production levels that could have been attained if there was sufficient customer demand 
the company intends to adopt this statement in fiscal in january  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act expands medicare  primarily by adding a prescription drug benefit for medicare eligibles starting in the act provides employers currently sponsoring prescription drug programs for medicare eligibles with a range of options for coordinating with the new government sponsored program to potentially reduce program cost

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential change in an asset s or financial instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate and unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and each of the euro  canadian dollar and mexican peso 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
the company s financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate payable on the company s borrowings is influenced by the company s operating performance and degree of leverage  as well as by actions of the federal reserve bank board in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate that underlies the cost of funds borrowed by the company 
in  as a response to improved economic conditions  the federal reserve took several actions to increase interest rates following a number of reductions in the federal funds interest rate in an effort to stimulate the us economy during and as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under its former credit facility increased in  contributing to a corresponding increase in interest expense 
to the extent that the federal reserve continues to increase the federal funds interest rate in the future  the effective interest rate on substantially all of the company s borrowing facilities will increase  and the company s interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant 
under the company s prior borrowing agreement  the company agreed to an average increase of in the base rate that it will pay on borrowed funds effective january based on the balance outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility at december   a change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by million 
exchange rate sensitivity the company has operations in several foreign countries  and approximately million of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
the company has not used foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates except with regard to the canadian dollar in no foreign exchange forward contracts were entered into during the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between company subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net income by less than million
