the company s strategy is comprised of four key objectives a to increase shareholder value  b to grow revenues in selected markets  c to achieve operational excellence  and d to be an employer of choice 
operating margin and cash generation improvement initiatives support the company s shareholder value objective 
drc has a balanced growth strategy aimed at organic growth in its existing markets and penetrating new market segments through acquisition

critical accounting policies there are business risks specific to the industries in which the company operates 
these risks include  but are not limited to estimates of costs to complete contract obligations  changes in government policies and procedures  government contracting issues and risks associated with technological development 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments made and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s systems and services business provides its services under time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which directly affects operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and include a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of certain costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have had no material impact on the company s revenue and operating income 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method or  for certain short term contracts  by the completed contract method  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the risk to the company related to a fixed price contract is that if estimates to complete the contract change from one period to the next  profit levels will vary from period to period 
for all types of contracts  the company recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in contract revenue and cost of contract revenue 
unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process are the amounts of recoverable contract revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
generally  the company s unbilled expenditures and fees relate to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings  or delayed for other reasons 
costs related to united states government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been 
table of contents recorded at amounts the company expects to realize upon final settlement 
unbilled expenditures and fees also include subcontractor costs for which invoices have not been received and for which revenues have not been recognized 
valuation allowances the company provides for potential losses against accounts receivable and unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process based on the company s expectation of a customer s ability to pay 
these reserves are based primarily upon specific identification of potential uncollectible accounts 
in addition  payments to the company for performance on united states government contracts are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
if necessary  the company provides an estimated reserve for adjustments resulting from rate negotiations and audit findings 
the company routinely provides for these items when they are identified and can be reasonably estimated 
intangible and other long lived assets the company uses assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of intangible and other long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is recognized in the period of identification and is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the useful lives and related amortization of intangible assets are based on their estimated residual value in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
the useful lives and related depreciation of other long lived assets are based on the company s estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by the company 
goodwill the company assesses goodwill for impairment at the segment level at least once each year by applying a fair value test 
goodwill could be impaired due to market declines  reduced expected future cash flows  or other factors or events 
should the fair value of goodwill  as determined by the company at any measurement date  fall below its carrying value  a charge for impairment of goodwill would occur in that period 
business combinations since  the company has completed three business acquisitions 
the company determines and records the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the dates of acquisition 
the company utilizes an independent valuation specialist to determine the fair values of identifiable intangible assets acquired in order to allocate a portion of the purchase price to these assets 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event it is determined that the company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
pensions accounting and reporting for the company s pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including but not limited to  discount rate  rate of compensation increases and expected return on assets 
if these assumptions differ materially from actual results  the company s obligations under the pension plan could also differ materially  potentially requiring the company to record an additional pension liability 
an actuarial valuation is performed each year 
the results of this actuarial valuation are reflected in the accounting for the pension plan upon determination

impact of inflation and changing prices overall  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations 
additionally  the terms of department of defense contracts  which accounted for approximately of revenue in  are generally one year contracts and include salary increase factors for future years  thus reducing the potential impact of inflation on the company 
factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
these are risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or which we currently deem immaterial  or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline 
our revenue is highly concentrated on the department of defense and other federal agencies  and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a few customers 
decreases in their budgets  changes in program priorities or military base closures could affect our results 
in the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenue  respectively  was derived from united states government agencies 
within the department of defense  certain programs account for a significant portion of our united states government business 
our revenue from contracts with the department of defense  either as a prime contractor or subcontractor  accounted for approximately of our total revenue in both and we cannot provide any assurance that any of these programs will continue as such or will continue at current levels 
our revenue could be adversely affected by significant changes in defense spending during periods of declining united states 
table of contents defense budgets 
among the effects of this general decline has been increased competition within a consolidating defense industry 
under procedures established by the base reduction and closure act  the department of defense has announced its intention to select in certain military bases for closure 
in  the department of defense published an initial list of bases from which it is expected the final selections will be made 
hanscom air force base and other installations at which the company does business were included on the initial list for consideration 
should a base be selected for closure at which the company has significant business  the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
it is not possible for us to predict whether defense budgets will increase or decline in the future 
further  changing missions and priorities in the defense budget may have adverse effects on our business 
funding limitations could result in a reduction  delay or cancellation of existing or emerging programs 
we anticipate there will continue to be significant competition when our defense contracts are re bid  as well as significant competitive pressure to lower prices  which may reduce profitability in this area of our business  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we must bear the risk of various pricing structures associated with government contracts 
we historically have derived a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts and subcontracts with the united states government 
a significant portion of our federal and state government contracts are undertaken on a time and materials nature  with fixed hourly rates that are intended to cover salaries  benefits  other indirect costs of operating the business and profit 
the pricing of such contracts is based upon estimates of future costs and assumptions as to the aggregate volume of business that we will perform in a given business division or other relevant unit 
alternatively  we undertake various government projects on a fixed price basis  as distinguished from billing on a time and materials basis 
under a fixed price contract  the government pays an agreed upon price for our services or products  and we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profits or cause us to incur a loss 
significant cost overruns can occur if we fail to adequately estimate the resources required to complete a project  properly determine the scope of an engagement  or complete our contractual obligation in a manner consistent with the project plan 
for fixed price contracts  we must estimate the costs necessary to complete the defined statement of work and recognize revenue or losses in accordance with such estimates 
actual costs may vary materially from the estimates made from time to time  necessitating adjustments to reported revenue and net income 
underestimates of the costs associated with a project could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
while we endeavor to maintain and improve contract profitability  we cannot be certain that any of our existing or future time and materials or fixed price projects will be profitable 
a substantial portion of our united states government business is as a subcontractor 
in such circumstances  we generally bear the risk that the prime contractor will meet its performance obligations to the united states government under the prime contract and that the prime contractor will have the financial capability to pay us amounts due under the subcontract 
the inability of a prime contractor to perform or make required payments to us could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our contracts and subcontracts with government agencies are subject to a competitive bidding process and to termination without cause by the government 
a significant portion of our federal and state government contracts are renewable on an annual basis  or are subject to the exercise of contractual options 
multi year contracts often require funding actions by the united states government  state legislature or others on an annual or more frequent basis 
as a result  our business could experience material adverse consequences should such funding actions or other approvals not be taken 
recent federal regulations and renewed congressional interest in small business set aside contracts is likely to influence decisions pertaining to contracting methods for many of the company s customers 
these regulations require more frequent review and certification of small business contractor status  so as the ensure that companies competing for contracts 
table of contents intended for small business are qualified as such at the time of the competition 
in the years ended december  and  the company derived million and million  respectively  of revenue from a small business set aside contract held by its hj ford subsidiary and due for re competition in the customer has currently indicated that the re competition will continue to be set aside  or reserved  to include only prime contractors that qualify as small businesses under regulations established by the small business administration 
the company will strive to retain its current work by moving work to other contract vehicles to the extent possible and by partnering with firms that will qualify as small businesses 
to the extent these efforts are not successful  the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the company s contracts with the internal revenue service  air force electronic systems center and aeronautical systems center are subject to re competition in governmental awards of contracts are subject to regulations and procedures that permit formal bidding procedures and protests by losing bidders 
such protests may result in significant delays in the commencement of expected contracts  the reversal of a previous award decision or the reopening of the competitive bidding process  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
because of the complexity and scheduling of contracting with government agencies  from time to time we may incur costs before receiving contractual funding by the united states government 
in some circumstances  we may not be able to recover such costs in whole or in part under subsequent contractual actions 
failure to collect such amounts may have material adverse consequences on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the united states government has the right to terminate contracts for convenience 
if the government terminated contracts with us  we would generally recover costs incurred up to termination  costs required to be incurred in connection with the termination and a portion of the fee earned commensurate with the work we have performed to termination 
however  significant adverse effects on our indirect cost pools may not be recoverable in connection with a termination for convenience 
contracts with state and other governmental entities are subject to the same or similar risks 
we are subject to a high level of government regulations and audits under our government contracts and subcontracts 
as a defense contractor  we are subject to many levels of audit and review  including by the defense contract audit agency  various inspectors general  the defense criminal investigative service  the general accounting office  the department of justice and congressional committees 
these audits  reviews and the pending grand jury investigation and civil suit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts could result in the termination of contracts  the imposition of fines or penalties  the withholding of payments due to us or the prohibition from participating in certain united states government contracts for a specified period of time 
any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
loss of key personnel could limit our growth 
we are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel 
many of our technical personnel may have specific knowledge and experience related to various government customer operations and these individuals would be difficult to replace in a timely fashion 
in addition  qualified technical personnel are in high demand worldwide and are likely to remain a limited resource 
the loss of services of key personnel could impair our ability to perform required services under some of our contracts  to retain such business after the expiration of the existing contract  or to win new business in the event that we lost the services of individuals who have been identified in a given proposal as key personnel in the proposal 
any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our failure to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances may limit our ability to perform classified work for government clients  which could harm our business 
some government contracts require us to maintain facility security clearances  and require some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances 
if our employees lose or are unable to obtain security clearances on a timely basis  or we lose a facility clearance  the government client can terminate the contract or decide not to renew the contract upon its expiration 
as a result  to the extent that we cannot obtain the required security clearances for our employees working on a 
table of contents particular contract  or we fail to obtain them on a timely basis  we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
security breaches in sensitive government systems could harm our business 
many of the systems we develop  install and maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in intelligence  national security  and other sensitive or classified government functions 
a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  damage our reputation  and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for federal government clients 
we could incur losses from such a security breach that could exceed the policy limits under our errors and omissions and product liability insurance 
damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  which could harm our business 
we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with federal government procurement regulations  engaging in unauthorized activities  or falsifying time records 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are involved in various litigation matters which  if not resolved in our favor  could harm our business 
on october   two former company employees were indicted and charged with conspiracy to defraud the united states  and wire fraud  among other charges  arising out of a scheme to defraud the united states out of approximately million 
both men subsequently pled guilty to the principal charges against them 
on october   the united states attorney s office filed a civil complaint in the district court of massachusetts against the company based in substantial part upon the actions and omissions of the former executives that gave rise to the criminal cases against them 
in the civil action  the united states is asserting claims against the company based on the false claims act and the anti kickback act  in addition to certain common law and equitable claims 
the united states seeks to recover up to three times its actual damages and penalties under the false claims act  and double damages and penalties under the anti kickback act 
the united states also seeks to recover its costs and interest in this action 
the company believes it has substantive defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously defend itself 
however  the outcome of this litigation and other proceedings to which the company is a part  if unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  the antitrust division of the department of justice is engaged in an investigation  currently focused on the period from to  into bidding and procurement activities involving the company and several other defense contractors who may also be subjects of the investigation 
although the company is cooperating in the investigation  it does not have a sufficient basis to predict the outcome of the investigation 
should the company be found to have violated antitrust laws  the matter could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently eliminate the significant deficiencies that have been identified in our internal controls and procedures  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
in march  our management and audit committee were notified by our independent accountants  grant thornton llp  of two significant deficiencies in our internal controls and procedures regarding  first  the accrual of subcontractor work performed and  second  our manually intensive financial reporting process 
in  our management and audit committee were notified by our then engaged independent accountants  kpmg llp  of three significant deficiencies relating to contract initiation and set up for certain fixed price contracts  inefficiencies in our quarterly and year end closing procedures and consolidation and the level of sec and generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  experience of our personnel responsible for accounting and financial reporting 
although we are committed to addressing these deficiencies  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement the revised controls and procedures or that our revised controls 
table of contents and procedures will be effective in remedying all of the identified significant deficiencies 
our inability to successfully eliminate these significant deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our auditors are completing their work relating to the preparation and delivery of their attestation report on our management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
the outcome of that work could impact the matters reported in this form k and require amendment of this form k 
moreover  this form k is incomplete until the time the auditor reports and consents discussed on the cover page to this form k and amendments to item a of part ii of this form k are included in an amendment filed on form k a 
if this annual report on form k is not so amended or completed by march   we will not be current in our sec filings 
we operate in highly competitive markets and may have difficulties entering new markets 
the markets for our services are highly competitive 
the government contracting business is subject to intense competition from numerous companies  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors are prior performance  previous experience  technical competence and price 
competition in the market for our commercial products is also intense 
there is a significant lead time for developing such business  and it involves substantial capital investment including development of prototypes and investment in manufacturing equipment 
principal competitive factors are product quality  the ability to specialize our engineering in order to meet our customers specific system requirements and price 
our precision products business has a number of competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
competitive pressures in our government and commercial businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in our efforts to enter new markets  including commercial markets and united states government agencies other than the department of defense  we generally face significant competition from other companies that have prior experience with such potential customers  as well as significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
as a result  we may not achieve the level of success that we expect in our efforts to enter such new markets 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
our precision manufactured products are generally designed to operate as important components of complex systems or products 
defects in our products could cause our customer s product or systems to fail or perform below expectations 
although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for such defects or failures  we cannot assure you that our attempts to limit our liability will be successful 
like other manufacturing companies  we may be subject to claims for alleged performance issues related to our products 
such claims  if made  could damage our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
economic events may affect our business segments 
many of our precision products are components of commercial products 
factors that affect the production and demand for such products  including economic events both domestically and in other regions of the world  competition  technological change and production disruption  could adversely affect demand for our products 
many of our products are incorporated into capital equipment  such as machine tools and other automated production equipment  used in the manufacture of other products 
as a result  this portion of our business may be subject to fluctuations in the manufacturing sector of the overall economy 
an economic recession  either in the united states or elsewhere in the world  could have a material adverse effect on the rate of orders received by the commercial division 
significantly lower production volumes resulting in under utilization of our manufacturing facilities would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our products and services could become obsolete due to rapid technological changes in the industry 
we offer sophisticated products and services in areas in which there have been and are expected to continue to be significant technological changes 
many of our products are incorporated into sophisticated machinery  equipment or electronic systems 
technological changes may be incorporated into competitors products that may adversely affect the market for our products 
if our competitors introduce superior technologies or products  we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond quickly enough to such changes or to offer services that satisfy our customers requirements at a competitive price 
further  we cannot provide any assurance that our research and product development efforts will be successful or result in new or improved products that may be required to sustain our market position 

table of contents our financing requirements may increase and we could have limited access to capital markets 
while we believe that our current resources and access to capital markets are adequate to support operations over the near term and foreseeable future  we cannot assure you that these circumstances will remain unchanged 
our need for capital is dependent on operating results and may be greater than expected 
our ability to maintain our current sources of debt financing depends on our ability to remain in compliance with certain covenants contained in our financing agreements  including  among other requirements  maintaining a minimum total net worth and minimum cash flow and debt coverage ratios 
if changes in capital markets restrict the availability of funds or increase the cost of funds  we may be required to modify  delay or abandon some of our planned expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
accounting system upgrades and conversions may delay billing and collections of our accounts receivable 
in  we installed a new enterprise business system  and from time to time  we may be required to make changes to that system as we integrate businesses or upgrade to new technologies 
future accounting system conversions and upgrades could cause delays in billing and collection of accounts receivable under our contracts  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the number  size and timing of client projects commenced and completed during a quarter  bid and proposal efforts undertaken  progress on fixed price projects during a given quarter  employee productivity and hiring  attrition and utilization rates  accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  and general economic conditions 
demand for our products and services in each of the markets we serve can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to revisions in customer budgets or schedules and other factors beyond our control 
in addition  because a high percentage of our expenses is fixed and does vary relative to revenue  a decrease in revenue may cause a significant variation in our operating results 
we may not make or complete future mergers  acquisitions or strategic alliances or investments 
in  we acquired impact innovations group llc  and in  we acquired hj ford associates  inc and andrulis corporation 
we may seek to continue to expand our operations through mergers  acquisitions or strategic alliances with businesses that will complement our existing business 
however  we may not be able to find attractive candidates  or enter into acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us  or successfully integrate the operations of companies that we acquire 
in addition  we may compete with other companies for these acquisition candidates  which could make an acquisition more expensive for us 
if we are able to successfully identify and complete an acquisition or similar transaction  it could involve a number of risks  including  among others the difficulty of assimilating the acquired operations and personnel  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of resources and management time  the potential failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  the difficulty of integrating systems  operations and cultures  and the potential impairment of relationships with customers as a result of changes in management or otherwise arising out of such transactions 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will be made  that we will be able to obtain financing needed to fund such acquisitions and  if any acquisitions are so made  that the acquired business will be successfully integrated into our operations or that the acquired business will perform as expected 
in addition  if we were to proceed with one or more 
table of contents significant strategic alliances  acquisitions or investments in which the consideration consists of cash  a substantial portion of our available cash could be used to consummate the strategic alliances  acquisitions or investments 
the financial impact of acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of securities of technology companies historically has faced significant volatility 
the stock market in recent years has also experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
many factors that have influenced trading prices will vary from period to period  including decreases in our earnings and revenue or quarterly operating results  changes in estimates by analysts  market conditions in the industry  announcements and new developments by competitors  and regulatory reviews 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk associated with our acquisition term loan  term loan and revolver  where interest payments are tied to either the libor or prime rate 
the interest rate on the acquisition term loan was at december   under the day libor rate option elected on november  the interest rate on the term loan was at december   under the day libor rate option elected on november  the interest rate on the revolver was at december   under the day libor rate option elected on december  at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest expense as reported in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
an increase of one full percentage point in the interest rate on the company s acquisition term loan  term loan and revolver would result in increases in annual interest expense aggregating million 
the company presently has no investments  and  accordingly  no exposure to market interest rates on investments 
the company has no significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign sales  which are nominal  are primarily denominated in united states dollars
