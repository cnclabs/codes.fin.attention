item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  contained in this document 
please refer to the glossary of terms immediately following the table of contents for a list and detailed description of the various technical  industry and other defined terms that are used in this form k 
we are in the business of designing and developing advanced wireless technology solutions which we make available for license or sale to semiconductor companies and equipment producers 
our advanced technology solutions are comprised of inventions  know how and other technical data eg  software designs and specifications related to the design and operation of digital wireless products and systems 
we patent many of our inventions and license those inventions to wireless communications equipment producers and related suppliers 
in addition  we offer for sale or license  on a non exclusive basis  various portions of the technology eg  reference designs  algorithms  know how and software to producers of wireless equipment products and components 
our advanced technology solutions have been developed both independently  in conjunction with certain equipment manufacturers and through strategic acquisitions 
we also actively participate in the standard setting process for wireless technologies  contributing solutions that are incorporated  from time to time  into standards 
in  we generated substantially all of our revenue from patent license agreements 
in third quarter  we transitioned to reporting per unit royalties in the period in which we receive our licensees royalty reports rather than in the period in which our licensees sales of covered products occur 
consequently  our results for include only three quarters of per unit royalties compared to four quarters in our revenues in  and included approximately million  million and nearly million  respectively  related to our licensees product sales from prior periods 
in and  our revenues also included million and million  respectively  of previously received non refundable prepayments that were recognized upon our receipt of evidence that the licensees had discontinued sales of covered products 
these non recurring items represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
we also recorded million of other income in related to the settlement of a patent litigation that was not associated with a pre existing patent license agreement 
unpredictable  non recurring amounts like those noted above could continue in the future 
in the last three years  we have signed eleven new or amended patent license agreements with both new and existing customers  including six license agreements covering g technologies 
over that period  we nearly tripled our quarterly recurring patent license royalties  from million in first quarter to million in fourth quarter the increase resulted from both an increase in the number of licensees and higher royalties from existing licensees based on increased sales of covered g and g products 
we expect that our g g royalty mix will shift to a higher percentage of g royalties as the decade unfolds due to the emergence of the g market  the continued maturation of the g market and the expiration  beginning in  of certain of our tdma patents 

table of contents during  wireless handset manufacturers  including our licensees  continued to experience declining average selling prices on mature g devices with limited functionality eg  voice only handsets 
however  these decreases were offset in large part by both increased volumes and higher average selling prices for devices with increased functionality and features  such as g devices and camera enabled g handsets 
our royalty rates and terms differ by licensee 
some royalty obligations are calculated strictly as a percentage of sales 
other agreements provide for fixed royalties per unit sold and others provide for combinations or variations thereof 
as such  changes in our royalty revenue from covered handsets may not highly correlate with overall industry changes in average selling prices or volumes 
that was the case in both and when we experienced limited diminution in per unit royalties from licensees due to the mix of royalties and related agreements 
we believe our g licensing revenue will decline over time as a result of the continued maturation of the g market  coupled with the expiration of certain of our tdma patents in coming years 
from time to time  if we believe that a third party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell digital cellular products  and such third party will not enter into a patent license agreement with us  we may institute a patent infringement lawsuit against the third party 
in march  we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against lucent technologies  inc lucent  a leading manufacturer of cdma equipment  for infringement of seven united states patents 
the complaint seeks damages for past infringement and an injunction against future infringement as well as interest  costs  and attorney s fees 
lucent has responded to the lawsuit denying any infringement 
we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  may have disagreements as to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement 
for example  we may have a disagreement with a licensee as to the amount of reported sales and royalties due 
currently  we are involved in separate arbitration proceedings regarding our respective license agreements with nokia corporation nokia and samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung 
the evidentiary hearing and post filing briefs in the arbitration proceeding with nokia recently concluded 
the tribunal presiding over the arbitration proceeding with nokia is expected to deliver a draft award to the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce icc on or before an approximate date of march  the arbitration panel for our arbitration with samsung has informed the parties that the evidentiary hearing in this matter is scheduled to commence in june in  our cost of development increased from approximately million to approximately million and represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
our development efforts are integral to both establishing product offerings and expanding our portfolio of wireless patents and will continue to be a substantial portion of our operating expenses in the value of our deferred tax assets at december   including a net deferred tax asset of million relating to our federal net operating loss nol credit carryforwards  was million 
at december   we provided a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets other than those associated with revenue that was recognized in the computation of our foreign source withholding tax liability but deferred for financial statement purposes 
during  we determined that our recent operating performance coupled with our current expectations to generate future taxable income indicated that it was more likely than not that we would utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in third quarter  we recognized an increase in the value of our deferred tax assets of approximately million through a partial reversal of the valuation allowance 
of the million benefit  approximately million was recognized as income in the statement of operations and approximately million was credited directly to additional paid in capital 
our assessment of the value of our deferred tax assets did not take into consideration all potential income sources  such as impacts from litigation or arbitration proceedings 
we will continue to evaluate the potential use of our deferred tax assets and  depending on various factors  could reverse all or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance in the future 
we seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and have increased our cash and short term investment position from million at december  to million at december  we achieved this increase while investing approximately million during to repurchase one million shares of our common stock 
in fourth quarter  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase an additional one million shares of common stock 
in march  the board expanded their authorization under this share repurchase program by one million shares 
we initiated share repurchases under this share repurchase program early in we plan to continue to maintain a strong cash and short term investment position 
however  we will consider investment opportunities that may require us to reduce our cash and short term investment position and or increase our long term debt 
such opportunities may include  but are not limited to  additional share repurchase programs  accelerated investment in our internally developed technology and the acquisition of patents and technology products from third parties 
our revenue and cash flows are dependent  in large part  on the overall market for wireless products and our licensees share of that market 
over the course of the last ten years  the cellular communications industry has experienced rapid growth worldwide 
total worldwide cellular wireless communications subscribers rose from slightly more than million at the end of to billion at the end of in several countries  mobile telephones now outnumber fixed line telephones 
market analysts expect that the aggregate number of global wireless subscribers will reach billion in 
table of contents logo and data represents projections of handset sales 
source strategy analytics  inc march the growth in new cellular subscribers  combined with customers who are replacing their mobile phones  helped fuel the growth of mobile phone sales from approximately million units in to approximately million units in we believe the combination of a broad subscriber base  continued technological change  and the ever growing dependence on the internet  e mail and other digital media sets the stage for growth in the sales of wireless products and services through the balance of this decade 
while g services have been widely deployed as an initial enabler of robust data services  a number of service providers have deployed g equipment to further enable enhanced data services 
ntt docomo  the largest wireless operator in japan  launched a wcdma g network in japan in october this service now has over million subscribers 
g services have also been launched by hutchison  vodafone  orange and tim italy 
the deployment  pace and growth of the g market will depend upon the ability of manufacturers to offer and deliver fully functional equipment  including mobile phones  at affordable prices  and the introduction and uptake of new services designed to use the enhanced data capability 
major manufacturers brought g mobile phones to market during approximately million wcdma enabled phones were sold in  and analysts have forecast shipments of to million wcdma enabled mobile phones in shipments of cdma x ev phones reached almost million units in and are expected to reach approximately million units in the adoption of g technologies including wcdma and cdma have been important contributors to our revenue in although we cannot always clearly identify the contribution from g versus g royalties in license agreements that cover both generations of air interface technology  our royalties from patent license agreements that include g grew to just over one half of our total revenues in compared to approximately in the continued adoption of g and our ability to license manufacturers of g equipment is integral to our strategy and necessary to replace revenues from g only royalties which we expect will begin to decline in in addition to the advances in cellular technologies  additional wireless technologies designed to provide data and other communications have emerged 
in particular  ieee wlan has gained momentum in recent years as a wireless broadband solution in the home  office and in public areas 
ieee technology offers high speed data connectivity through unlicensed spectrum within a relatively modest operating range 
from initial semiconductor shipments of products built to the ieee standard in  sales have nearly doubled every year since introduction 
while relatively small compared to the cellular market million ieee wireless integrated circuits shipped in the affordability and attractiveness of the technology has helped fuel rapid market growth 
in addition  the ieee wireless standards bodies are currently creating sets of standards to enable higher data rates  provide coverage over longer distances and enable roaming 
in  we signed an million agreement with general dynamics to serve as a subcontractor on the mobile user objective system muos program for the us military as more fully disclosed under our discussion of significant agreements and events below 
while more than of our revenues were related to patent license royalties  we expect that as a result of this agreement  our product and service offerings will begin to contribute revenues in 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  and are included in item of the form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others  are those relating to patents  contingencies  revenue recognition  compensation  and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions had existed  our financial results could have been materially different 
patents we capitalize external costs  such as filing fees and associated attorney fees  incurred to obtain issued patents and patent license rights 
we expense costs associated with maintaining and defending our patents subsequent to their issuance 
we amortize capitalized patent costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the patents 
ten years represents our best estimate of the average useful lives of our patents relating to technology developed directly by the company 
the ten year estimated life of internally generated patents is based on our assessment of such factors as the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed  the overall makeup of the portfolio over time and the term s of license agreements for such patents 
the estimated useful lives of acquired patents and patent rights  however  will be based on analysis related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of patents obtained directly by the company 
we assess the potential impairment to all capitalized net patent costs when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these patents may not be recovered 
amortization expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we capitalized gross patent costs of million and million  respectively  such costs were offset by accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively 
the weighted average estimated useful life of our capitalized patent costs at december  and was years and years  respectively 
contingencies we recognize contingent assets and liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
in first quarter  we accrued a million liability related to an insurance reimbursement agreement 
our insurance carrier has demanded arbitration  claiming that our obligation under the agreement is approximately million 
we have since filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the insurance reimbursement agreement is void and that we are due damages from our insurance carrier for their bad faith and breach of obligations under a related insurance policy 
at this time  it is impossible to predict the outcome of the litigation and any arbitration  therefore we have not adjusted our original accrual of million 
revenue recognition in  we derived revenue principally from patent licensing 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized from each source depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and multi faceted 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  and advanced payments and fees for service arrangements 
due to the combined nature of some agreements and the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements may sometimes be recognized over the combined performance period 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  the determining factors necessary to allocate revenue across past  current  and future years may be difficult to establish 
in such instances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances 
generally  we will not recognize revenue related to payments that are due greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility of fees is reasonably assured 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we have no material future obligations associated with such licenses  other than  in some instances  to provide such licensees with notification of future license agreements pursuant to most favored licensee rights 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for prior sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods 
such consideration may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue 
we may also receive consideration from the settlement of patent infringement litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
we record the consideration related to such litigation as other income 

table of contents paid up amounts up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement  for the lifetime of the agreement 
prepayments up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a licensee s future obligations to us related to its expected covered product sales in future periods 
our licensees obligations to pay royalties extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a licensee exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its covered product sales in the current contractual reporting period 
we recognize revenues related to consideration for prior sales when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed and determinable price and determined that collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues related to paid up amounts on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we have no future obligations under these licenses and we can not reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
licensees that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
consideration for prior sales  the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
in third quarter  we transitioned our recognition of these per unit royalties to recognize the revenue in the period in which we receive royalty reports from licensees  rather than in the period in which our licensees underlying sales occur 
the transition was necessary because we could no longer both wait to receive royalty reports from our licensees and file our financial statements on a timely basis 
without royalty reports  our visibility into our licensees sales is very limited because we are not involved in the supply or sale of their products and industry analysts do not provide information detailed or timely enough to give us sufficient visibility to make reasonably accurate estimates for our most significant licensees 
as such  it is unlikely that we could arrive at estimates for our most significant licensees that are objective and supportable 
previously  we recognized revenue related to per unit sales of covered products in the period the sales occurred 
when we did not receive the royalty reports prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we accrued the related royalty revenue if reasonable estimates could be made 
such estimates  which were limited to a small number of licensees and never exceeded of our revenue in any period presented  were based on the historical royalty data of the licensees involved  currently available third party forecasts of royalty related product sales in the applicable market and  if available  information provided by the licensee 
when our licensees formally reported royalties for which we had previously accrued revenues based on estimates  or when they reported updates to prior royalty reports  we adjusted revenue in the period in which the final reports were received 
in cases where we receive objective  verifiable evidence that a licensee has discontinued sales of covered products  we recognize any remaining deferred revenue balance related to unexhausted prepayments in the period that we receive such evidence 
software and service revenues software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop software revenue recognition and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with the customer includes significant production  modification or customization of the software  the company uses contract accounting  as required by sop for those arrangements accounted for under sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  the company uses the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract costs 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 
we recognize revenues associated with service arrangements that are outside the scope of sop on a straight line basis under staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
recently  our service agreements have been long term in nature and we have recorded revenue from them based on our proportional performance of services rendered 
the terms of these arrangements have provided evidence that this approach better reflects the pattern in which the revenue has been earned or the obligations have been fulfilled 
when recognizing revenue based on our proportional performance  we measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred contract costs and total estimated contract costs 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe labor cost provides a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded when the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
deferred charges 
table of contents from time to time  we use sales agents to assist us in our licensing activities 
we often pay a commission related to successfully negotiated patent license agreements 
the commission rate varies from agreement to agreement 
commissions are normally paid shortly after the receipt of cash payments associated with our patent license agreements 
we defer recognition of commission expense related to prepayments and paid up amounts and amortize these expenses in proportion to our recognition of the related revenue 
in  and  we paid approximately million  million and million of commissions and recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of commission expense as part of patent licensing and administration expense 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of deferred commission expense included within prepaid and other current assets and other non current assets 
compensation we invest heavily in the development of advanced wireless technology and related products by building and sustaining a highly specialized engineering team 
over each of the last three years  our cost of development has represented roughly one half of our total operating expenses 
the largest portion of our cost of development has been personnel costs 
as of december  we employed engineers  of whom hold master s degrees and hold phds 
we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain engineers and other key employees and more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  an annual bonus tied to performance goals  cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances  as well as a long term compensation program that includes restricted stock units rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
we accrued million and million of compensation expense in related to the performance based cash incentive and restricted stock units rsus  respectively 
we amortize the expense associated with our rsus using an accelerated method 
the amount of expense accrued in related to the performance based cash incentive was based on our assumption that the company will meet of its goals under the long term cash based incentive 
if we had assumed that the company s performance will meet of the company s associated goals  we would have recorded approximately million of additional operating expense 
if we had assumed that the company s performance will meet of the associated goals  we would have recognized approximately million less operating expense in there is no cash pay out for performance that falls below of target results 
we expect that the expenses associated with the performance based cash incentive and rsus will each increase by between million to million in as we accrue expenses for both the final year of the initial measurement period april through december and begin the first year of the first three year measurement period under our long term compensation programs 
however  the amount recorded may change dependant upon our future expectations to attain performance targets 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
we recognize deferred tax assets related to deferred revenue for both us federal income tax purposes and non us jurisdictions that assess a source withholding tax on related royalty payments 
we expense these deferred tax assets in accordance with fas as the related temporary differences reverse 
in  and  we paid approximately million  million and million of foreign source withholding tax and recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of foreign source withholding tax expense in our income tax provision in accordance with this policy 
our accumulated tax losses  which include allowable deductions related to exercised employee stock options  generated federal nol credit carryforwards of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these nol credit carryforwards were the largest component of our deferred tax assets which  before any adjustment for valuation allowance  had tax effected values of million and million  respectively 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that we will be unable to utilize the asset to offset future taxes 
at december   we provided a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets other than those associated with revenue that was recognized in the computation of our foreign source withholding tax liability but deferred for financial statement purposes 
in  we determined that our recent operating performance coupled with our current expectations to generate future taxable income indicated that it was more likely than not that we would utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in third quarter  we recognized an increase in the value of our deferred tax assets of approximately million through a partial reversal of the valuation allowance 
of the million benefit  approximately million was recognized as income in our statement of operations and approximately million was credited directly to additional paid in capital 
our assessment of the value of our deferred tax assets did not take into consideration all potential income sources  such as impacts from litigation or arbitration proceedings 
we will continue to evaluate the potential use of our deferred tax assets and  depending on various factors  could reverse all or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance in the future 
we believe that the future utilization of our deferred tax assets  which are 
table of contents currently offset by a valuation allowance  continues to be dependent  in part  upon our success in three key areas  the market acceptance of our technology products  the outcome of outstanding patent license arbitrations and our ability to sign additional patent license agreements 
we will continue to provide a valuation allowance on a portion of our deferred tax assets until our success in these or other areas provides evidence that our deferred tax assets will be more fully utilized 
our cash income tax obligations are currently limited to foreign source withholding taxes on patent license royalties  state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax 
however  because we have recognized a portion of our deferred tax assets  we expect to provide for income taxes in at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate to under current tax laws  respectively  plus an amount for deferred foreign source withholding tax expense which is in part dependent  in part  upon licensee royalty reports 
subsequent revisions to the estimated realizable value of our deferred tax assets could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until our nol credit carryforward is fully utilized or has expired 
significant agreements and events general dynamics in december  we entered into an agreement with general dynamics decision systems  inc general dynamics  to serve as a subcontractor on the mobile user objective system muos program for the us military 
muos is an advanced tactical terrestrial and satellite communications system utilizing g commercial cellular technology to provide significantly improved high data rate and assured communications for us warfighters 
the software license agreement requires us to deliver to general dynamics standards compliant wcdma modem technology  originating from the technology developed under our agreement with infineon  for incorporation into handheld terminals 
under the agreement  we expect to receive million for delivery of and a limited license in our commercial technology solution for use within the government s muos and joint tactical radio system programs  maintenance and product training 
the agreement also includes options that are exercisable by general dynamics at various times through march for additional deliverables for up to million 
we anticipate that a majority of our muos program deliverables and related payments will occur in  excluding the exercise of options for additional deliverables 
we will provide maintenance and support to general dynamics for three years following delivery of the technology 
in addition to the deliverables specifically identified in the agreement  we have agreed to provide additional future services as requested by general dynamics 
the contract may be terminated for convenience if the us government terminates for convenience that portion of the muos program that includes general dynamics 
we are accounting for the delivery of and limited license in our commercial technology platform under the software license agreement using the percentage of completion method 
this portion of the agreement is valued at million 
in  we recognized approximately million in revenue and at december  our accounts receivable included a related unbilled amount of approximately million 
in early  we completed the first milestones under the agreement and have received million in related payments 
subsequent to our delivery of our commercial technology platform  we will provide general dynamics with support for a period of three years 
this portion of the contract is valued at million and revenue related to this portion will be recognized evenly over the period of support 
repositioning in second quarter  we reduced our headcount by employees as part of a plan to strategically reposition the company 
we recorded a charge of approximately million in second quarter associated with this repositioning 
the charge was comprised primarily of severance and other cash benefits associated with the workforce reduction 
during the balance of  we adjusted our repositioning charge by less than million and paid off all liabilities associated with this restructuring 
at december  we believe that our financial obligations associated with this repositioning are substantially complete and do not expect to report further costs associated with the repositioning 

table of contents new accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
as originally issued in  sfas no 
established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
we will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first interim reporting period that begins after june   and we plan to adopt it using the modified prospective method  effective july  we are currently evaluating the effect sfas no 
r will have on our results 
based on our preliminarily analysis  we expect to incur between million and million in additional compensation expense from stock options during the period july  to december  as a result of this new accounting standard 
litigation and legal proceedings nokia nokia arbitration in july  nokia requested arbitration regarding nokia s royalty payment obligations for its worldwide sales of g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge products under the existing patent license agreement with interdigital technology corporation itc  a wholly owned subsidiary of interdigital communications corporation nokia arbitration 
pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions of the patent license agreement  the arbitration is being conducted in the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce icc 
the binding arbitration relates to itc s claim that the patent license agreements itc signed with ericsson and sony ericsson in march defined the financial terms under which nokia would be required to pay royalties on its worldwide sales of g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge products commencing january  nokia is seeking a determination that its obligation under our existing patent license agreement is not defined by our patent license agreements with ericsson and sony ericsson or has been discharged 
nokia also is seeking a ruling that no royalty rate for its sales after january  can be determined by the arbitration panel nokia tribunal until certain contractual conditions precedent have been satisfied 
nokia has additionally claimed that  in any event  the nokia tribunal cannot award money damages 
itc filed an answer to nokia s request for arbitration arguing that the patent license agreements signed with ericsson and sony ericsson in march defined the financial terms under which nokia would be required to pay royalties on its worldwide sales of g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge products commencing january   that nokia s duty to pay these royalties has not been discharged  and that the documents sought by nokia are not relevant to the royalty determination 
itc also counterclaimed for an arbitration decision requiring that nokia pay us royalties on equivalent terms and conditions as those set forth in the ericsson and sony ericsson patent license agreements for the period january  to december   and a determination of the amount of the royalty and payment terms 
during fourth quarter  nokia filed a reply contesting our claims and included additional claims and defenses relating to the validity and infringement of certain of itc s patents 
subsequently  nokia withdrew from the arbitration its claims pertaining to invalidity and non infringement of those same itc patents  but maintains that the validity and infringement of those patents is a factor the arbitration panel should consider in the arbitration 
we do not believe that the issues of patent validity or infringement are relevant to the arbitrable royalty dispute and have contested nokia s position 
the hearing in the nokia arbitration was conducted in january and the nokia tribunal has notified the parties that the nokia tribunal expects to submit an internal draft award to the icc on or before march  as an approximate date 
the icc has set may  as the last date for rendering a final award and the company anticipates a decision by the icc on or before such last date absent an earlier resolution by the parties 
any final award could be subject to appeal filings on limited bases and enforcement proceedings by the parties 

table of contents other nokia proceedings in july  nokia filed a motion to intervene in the now settled ericsson litigation in the united states district court for the northern district of texas and to gain access to documents previously sealed by the court in the settled litigation 
we filed a response opposing the request to intervene and opposing the request for access to the documents 
the court granted nokia s motion to intervene in the ericsson litigation  and provided nokia with document access on a limited basis 
thereafter  the nokia tribunal ordered that certain documents from the ericsson litigation be produced to nokia for its use in the nokia arbitration  though the nokia tribunal made no decision as to whether issues of patent infringement or validity were relevant to the determination of nokia s royalty obligation 
nokia subsequently filed a motion to reinstate certain decisions that were vacated in the now settled ericsson litigation  which motion was granted by the court 
we have appealed that ruling to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
nokia is contesting our appeal 
in late  nokia sought to enforce two subpoenas issued by the nokia tribunal to ericsson and sony ericsson seeking certain documents 
those enforcement actions were commenced in the federal district court for the northern district of texas and the federal district court for the eastern district of north carolina 
nokia has withdrawn both enforcement actions 
during the nokia arbitration  on june  nokia commenced a patent revocation proceeding in the united kingdom high court of justice  chancery division  patents court  seeking to have three of itc s uk patents declared invalid uk revocation proceeding 
nokia also seeks a declaration that the manufacture and sale of certain mobile and infrastructure equipment does not infringe these patents  and that the patents are not essential under the applicable standard 
itc is contesting all of these claims  and the trial is scheduled to commence in october in connection with the uk revocation proceeding  in september nokia filed an action against sony ericsson in the federal district court for the eastern district of north carolina  and an action against ericsson in the federal district court for the eastern district of texas 
the actions are based upon united states code section which provides for discovery in a united states court for use in a foreign proceeding and addresses jurisdictional  procedural and evidentiary matters associated with such foreign proceeding 
in both actions  nokia sought documents related to the itc patents and patent licenses 
both the federal district court for the eastern district of texas and the eastern district of north carolina have denied nokia s motions with respect to any documents not previously produced in the nokia arbitration 
during the nokia arbitration  in january  nokia and nokia  inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware against interdigital communications corporation and itc for declaratory judgments of patent invalidity and non infringement of certain claims of certain patents  and violations of the lanham act 
we have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
samsung in  during an arbitration proceeding  samsung elected  under its patent license agreement with itc samsung license agreement  to have samsung s royalty obligations commencing january  for g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge wireless communications products be determined in accordance with the terms of the nokia patent license agreement  including its mfl provision 
by notice in march  itc notified samsung that such samsung obligations had been defined by the relevant licensing terms of itc s license agreements with ericsson for infrastructure products and sony ericsson for terminal unit products as a result of the mfl provision in the nokia license agreement 
in november  samsung initiated a binding arbitration against the company and itc 
the arbitration was filed with the icc 
samsung is seeking to have an icc arbitration panel determine that samsung s obligations under the samsung license agreement are not defined by our license agreements with ericsson and sony ericsson or  in the alternative  to determine the amount of the appropriate royalty due 
itc has counterclaimed for an arbitration decision requiring that samsung pay itc royalties on equivalent terms and conditions as those set forth in the ericsson and sony ericsson patent license agreements for the period january  to december   and determining the amount of the royalty and payment terms 
we also seek a declaration that the parties rights and obligations are governed by the samsung license agreement  and that the nokia patent license agreement dictates only samsung s royalty obligations and most favored rights for those products licensed under the samsung license agreement 
samsung has replied to itc s answer and counterclaim  maintaining samsung s position as set forth in its arbitration demand and arguing that it has succeeded to all of nokia s license rights  including its g license 
if the arbitration panel were to agree with samsung s position  samsung would be licensed to sell g products on the same terms as nokia 
in the alternative  samsung asserts that its royalty obligations should be governed by the mfl clause in the samsung license agreement 
the arbitration panel has informed the company and samsung that the evidentiary hearing in this matter is scheduled to commence in june 
table of contents lucent in march  tantivy communications  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas against lucent  a leading manufacturer of cdma equipment 
the case is based on our assertions of infringement by lucent of several of our subsidiary s patents issued in the united states 
the lawsuit seeks damages for past infringement and an injunction against future infringement as well as interest  costs  and attorneys fees 
lucent has responded to the lawsuit denying any infringement  and seeking a declaration of non infringement and that the patents are invalid 
lucent has requested attorneys fees and costs 
the court has issued a scheduling order pursuant to which the markman hearing for claim construction is scheduled for may  and the trial is scheduled to commence in september pursuant to court order  the parties attended a mediation session in january the parties are currently in the discovery phase of the litigation 
federal in october  federal insurance company federal  the insurance carrier for the now settled litigation involving ericsson inc  delivered to us a demand for arbitration under the pennsylvania uniform arbitration act 
federal claims  based on their determination of expected value to the company resulting from our settlement involving ericsson inc  that an insurance reimbursement agreement requires us to reimburse federal approximately million for attorneys fees and expenses it claims were paid by it 
on november  the company filed an action in united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania seeking a declaratory judgment that the reimbursement agreement is void and unenforceable  seeking reimbursement of attorneys fees and expenses which have not been reimbursed by federal and which were paid directly by the company in connection with the ericsson inc litigation  and seeking damages for federal s bad faith and breach of its obligations under the insurance policy 
in the alternative  in the event the reimbursement agreement is found to be valid and enforceable  the company is seeking a declaratory judgment that federal is entitled to reimbursement based only on certain portions of amounts received by the company from ericsson inc pursuant to the settlement of the litigation involving ericsson inc federal has requested the court to dismiss the action and or to have the matter referred to arbitration 
we have opposed such requests 
prior to federal s demand for arbitration  we had accrued a contingent liability of million related to the insurance reimbursement agreement 
if this matter results in us paying federal substantially more than the amount accrued  it could have a material impact on our financial results 

table of contents other we have filed patent applications in the united states and in numerous foreign countries 
in the ordinary course of business  we currently are  and expect from time to time to be  subject to challenges with respect to the validity of our patents and patent applications 
we intend to continue to vigorously defend the validity of our patents and defend against any such challenges 
however  if certain key patents are revoked or patent applications are denied  our patent licensing opportunities could be materially and adversely affected 
we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  have disagreements as to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable patent license agreement 
for example  we could have a disagreement with a licensee as to the amount of reported sales of covered products and royalties owed 
our patent license agreements typically provide for arbitration as the mechanism for resolving disputes 
arbitration proceedings can be resolved through an award rendered by an arbitration panel or through private settlement between the parties 
awards and settlements of arbitration proceedings can be substantial  but are uncertain  unpredictable and often of a non recurring nature 
in addition to disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property  including the litigation and other proceedings described above  we are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property but also arising in the ordinary course of our business 
based upon information presently available to us  we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other disputes and legal actions will not materially affect us 
financial position  liquidity and capital requirements in and  we generated net cash from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from net receipts of approximately million from patent licensing agreements 
this included million from nec corporation of japan nec associated with our g patent license agreement  million and million from sanyo electric co  ltd sanyo and toshiba corporation toshiba relating to their respective patent license agreements  million from sharp corporation of japan sharp related to g and g patent license agreements  million and million from ericsson and sony ericsson relating to their respective patent license agreements  and million from other licensees related to their respective patent license agreements 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation of million and changes in working capital during the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from net receipts of approximately million from patent licensing agreements 
this included million from ericsson and approximately million from sony ericsson under the above noted patent license agreements  million from nec associated with g and g patent license agreements  million from sharp related to g and g patent license agreements and million from other licensees related to their respective patent license agreements 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses of million and changes in working capital during we receive cash payments relating to current per unit royalties 
we also receive up front cash payments for paid up or prepaid royalties 
when we record the receipt or expected receipt of up front payments  we defer the recognition of the revenue associated with the up front payments pursuant to our revenue recognition policy as discussed in our critical accounting policies 
we have no material obligations associated with such deferred revenue 
our combined short term and long term deferred revenue balances at december  of approximately million increased million from december  the increase was mainly due to the receipt of approximately million in prepayments and paid up amounts  primarily from new  expanded or amended patent license agreements  including million from sanyo  million from sharp  million from toshiba and million from other licensees 
these receipts were offset  in part  by current year deferred revenue recognition of approximately million related to the amortization of paid up royalties and approximately million from current year per unit exhaustion of prepaid royalties based upon royalty reports provided by our licensees 
based on current license agreements  we expect to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million in related to the amortization of paid up royalties 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our licensees report against prepaid balances 
in january  we recorded an increase in deferred revenue of million related to a new prepayment from sony ericsson under their existing g g agreement 
net cash flows used in investing activities increased to million from million in we purchased million and million of short term marketable securities  net of sales  in and  respectively 
this change resulted from the higher level of cash receipts related to patent licensing in  combined with a reduced use of cash in financing activities 

table of contents total investments in capital assets of million in remained relatively constant with levels  while our investment costs associated with patents increased substantially from million in to million in there is often a lag between the filing of initial patent applications and the incurrence of costs to issue the patents both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
the increase in patent costs between and reflects increased patenting activity we have experienced over the past several years 
in  we expect that our purchases of property and equipment will be million to million 
we also expect that our capitalized patent costs will be between million to million 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of windshift holdings  inc formerly known as tantivy communications  inc  windshift for approximately million  including acquisition related costs 
net cash used in financing activities in decreased million to million from million in in  we repurchased one million shares of our common stock for a total of million compared to repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in for a total of million 
we received proceeds from option and warrant exercises of million and million in and  respectively 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase fourth quarter repurchase program of an additional one million shares of common stock 
in march  the board expanded their authorization under the fourth quarter repurchase program by one million shares 
we initiated share repurchases under this program in early and have repurchased  shares for a total of approximately million through march  we had  and  options outstanding at december  and  respectively  that had exercise prices less than the fair market value of the company s stock at each balance sheet date 
these options would generate million and million of cash proceeds to the company if they were fully exercised 
effective april   we adopted a long term incentive program applicable to a broad group of managers and executives  representing about one third of our workforce 
the program includes a cash incentive award tied to long term company performance goals and a grant of restricted stock units rsus that vest over time 
under this program  we substantially reduced the use of stock option grants as an equity incentive for these employees 
over the remaining three quarters of  we recognized approximately million and million of compensation expense related to the cash based incentive and rsus  respectively 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  our working capital adjusted to exclude cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  current maturities of debt and current deferred revenue decreased to million at december  from million at december  this million decrease is primarily due to a million reduction in accounts receivable resulting from our third quarter transition in reporting per unit royalty revenue 
as a result of this transition  we book per unit royalties in the period we receive the related royalty reports 
because we typically receive cash payments from current royalties in the same quarter we receive the related reports  we now collect most receivables in the same period we book the related revenue 
in first quarter  we acquired  for a purchase price of million  selected patents  intellectual property blocks and related assets from an unrelated third party  the function of which are aimed at improving the range  throughput and reliability of wireless lan and other wireless technology systems 
consistent with our strategy to focus our resources on the development and commercialization of advanced wireless technology products  we expect to see modest growth in operating cash needs related to planned staffing levels and continued investments in enabling capital assets in we are capable of supporting these and other operating cash requirements for the near future  as well as our fourth quarter repurchase program and our first quarter purchase of patents  intellectual property blocks and related assets  through cash and short term investments on hand  as well as other internally generated funds such as patent license royalty payments 
we do not expect that any resolution of the federal litigation matter will prevent us from supporting our operating requirements for the near future 
at present  we do not anticipate the need to seek additional financing through either bank facilities or the sale of debt or equity securities 
however  we may seek to establish a bank facility to provide additional flexibility in managing our business 
at december   we did not have any significant purchase obligations outside the course of our ordinary business 
following is a summary of our consolidated debt and lease obligations at december  in thousands obligation total years years thereafter debt operating leases total debt and operating lease obligations 
table of contents results of operations compared with revenues revenues in were million compared with million in in third quarter  we transitioned to reporting per unit royalties in the period in which we receive our licensees royalty reports rather than in the period in which our licensees underlying sales of covered product occur 
consequently  our results for include only three quarters of per unit royalties compared to four quarters in the decrease in revenues was due to the absence of per unit royalties in third quarter associated with the transition in reporting per unit royalties 
notwithstanding the effect of the transition on revenues  recurring patent license royalties which include both fixed and amortized amounts  as well as per unit royalties reported to the company increased from million in to million in this included million related to four quarters of fixed and amortized amounts  as well as million associated with three quarters of per unit royalties 
royalties from nec  sharp and sony ericsson collectively contributed of our recurring patent license royalty revenue in the million increase in recurring patent license royalty revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in royalties from nec offset by the effect of the absence of reporting per unit royalties for one quarter in in  we recorded non recurring revenue of million related to past infringement from a number of new licensees signed in and million associated with the remaining deferred revenue balance of a licensee that has discontinued sales of covered products 
we also recorded approximately million in revenues related to our software license agreement with general dynamics 
in  we recorded of non recurring royalty revenue primarily associated with sony ericsson s pre handset sales 
in  we also recorded million of revenue related to specialized engineering service revenue 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in our operating expenses reflects both our strong commitment to investing in the development of advanced wireless technology product solutions and legal costs associated with arbitration and litigation proceedings with nokia  samsung and lucent 
the million increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel costs million  legal fees million  patent amortization million and insurance premiums million and is partly offset by savings in other areas 
approximately and  respectively  of the increase in personnel costs was due to company wide compensation initiatives instituted in first half and the addition of our melbourne  florida design center 
the remaining increase in personnel costs was primarily due to severance associated with our second quarter repositioning and expanded training and development programs 
development expenses increased in to million from million in the increase resulted from a million increase in salaries and benefits primarily associated with compensation initiatives instituted in first half offset  in part  by a decrease of million in each of consulting fees and depreciation of fixed assets 
sales and marketing expenses of million in increased from million in primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits offset  in part  by decreased consulting costs 
general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in increased personnel costs accounted for of this increase with the balance of the increase due to public entity costs including audit fees and insurance premiums 
patents administration and licensing expenses increased in to million from million in nearly of this increase was due to higher patent enforcement costs related to our respective arbitrations with nokia and samsung and our litigation with lucent 
other income  interest income and interest expense in  we recognized million from the settlement of our litigation with ericsson  net of an estimated million associated with a claim under an insurance reimbursement agreement  as other income 
the million represents a loss contingency associated with our insurance reimbursement agreement with federal 
net interest income of million in remained relatively level with 
table of contents income taxes our income tax provision in included a benefit of approximately million related to the recognition of an increase in the value of our deferred tax assets and was offset in part by approximately million of federal income tax and alternative minimum tax and approximately million of foreign source withholding tax 
our income tax provision in consisted primarily of foreign source withholding taxes associated with patent licensing royalties  principally from japan 
the decrease in our foreign source withholding tax expense from to resulted primarily from a july tax treaty between the us and japan that eliminates the foreign source withholding tax requirements between these countries  provided certain conditions defined in the treaty are met 
compared with revenues revenues in increased to million from million in patent license royalty revenue in was million compared to million in specialized engineering service revenue was million in compared to million in revenues in included million and million of royalties from sony ericsson and other licensees  respectively  related to sales from periods prior to the effective dates of their respective agreements 
revenues in included nearly million of royalty revenue associated with nec s pre g sales  and the recognition of million of deferred revenue associated with non refundable and non transferable patent license prepayments previously received from kyocera corporation and denso corporation that had discontinued sales of covered products 
recurring patent license royalty revenue increased to million from million in royalties from nec  sharp and sony ericsson collectively contributed to of our recurring patent license royalty revenue in the increase in recurring patent license royalty revenue from to was due to million of recurring royalties related to patent license agreements with ericsson and sony ericsson and increases in recurring royalties from nec  sharp and other licensees of million  million and million  respectively 
royalties from nec increased due to nec s higher sales of infrastructure and handsets into the emerging g market 
royalties from sharp reflected increased demand for its g handsets both in japan and europe 
in fourth quarter  we completed the final delivery of services required under our wtdd technology development agreement with nokia  collected the final million payment due under this agreement and recognized million in related service revenue 
in  we recognized million of revenue for services performed under this agreement 
operating expenses development expenses decreased less than in to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to an accrued loss of million recorded in related to our wtdd agreement with nokia offset  in part  by an increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in costs associated with engineering tools and research and development materials 
sales and marketing expenses of million in increased from million in this increase was primarily attributable to approximately equal increases in costs related to trade shows and market research activities 
in  we participated in an additional trade show and also increased our market research efforts to support strategic planning activities 
general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in increases in public entity costs  including a million increase in our directors and officers liability insurance premiums  were the primary contributors to this increase 
we also incurred approximately million of costs in second half related to an update of our strategic plan 
patents administration and licensing expenses increased in to million from million in due largely to a million increase in amortization expense  resulting from an increase in the number of patents and related prosecution costs over the past couple years  a million increase in legal fees and a million increase in commission expense related to higher patent licensing royalty revenue 
other income  interest income and interest expense in  we recognized million from the settlement of our litigation with ericsson  net of an estimated million associated with a claim under an insurance reimbursement agreement  as other income 
the million represents a loss contingency associated with our insurance reimbursement agreement with federal 

table of contents interest income of million in decreased from million in primarily due to lower yields available in compared to income taxes tax expense decreased million in to million from million in  due primarily to a decrease in the level of royalty revenue subject to non us withholding tax 
the income tax provision in both and consisted primarily of withholding taxes associated with patent licensing royalties  principally from japan 
expected trends in first quarter  we expect to report revenue from current licensees of just over million 
in addition  we expect to recognize revenue associated with our agreement with general dynamics in the range of to million 
we also anticipate that our first quarter operating expenses will grow sequentially to due to long term compensation program expenses  normal wage inflation and investment in marketing  technology and product development in response to expanding market opportunities 
we also project that our book tax rate for first quarter will approximate to  plus an amount for deferred foreign source withholding tax expense  which is in part dependent on the level of per unit royalties 
cash taxes paid in first quarter should be minimal
