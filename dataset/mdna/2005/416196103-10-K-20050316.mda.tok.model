revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time the service is rendered or the product is delivered 
payments received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of the product are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the services are performed or the product is delivered 

table of contents the company s accounting policy for revenue recognition has an impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require judgments on the part of management 
the portion of the company s revenue that is most subject to estimates and judgments is revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method  as discussed below 
specifically  direct marketing revenue from certain projects and certain services such as database build services  internet web design  market research and analytical services may be billed at hourly rates or a set price 
if billed at a set price  the revenue is recognized over the contractual period  using the percentage of completion method 
management estimates and judgments are used in connection with the revenue recognized in these instances 
should actual costs differ significantly from the original estimated costs  the timing of revenues and overall profitability of the contract could be impacted 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method comprised less than of total direct marketing revenue and less than of total harte hanks revenue for the years ended december   and for all sales the company requires either a purchase order  a statement of work signed by the customer  a written contract  or some other form of written authorization from the customer 
direct marketing revenue is derived from a variety of services 
revenue from services such as creative and graphics  printing  personalization of communication pieces using laser and inkjet printing  targeted mail  fulfillment  agency services and transportation logistics are recognized as the work is performed 
revenue is typically based on a set price or rate given to the customer 
revenue from the ongoing production and delivery of data is recognized upon completion and delivery of the work and is typically based on a set price or rate 
revenue from time based subscriptions is based on a set price and is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
revenue from database build services may be billed based on hourly rates or at a set price

if billed at a set price  the revenue is recognized over the contractual period  using the percentage of completion method based on individual costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
in other instances  progress toward completion is based on performance milestones specified in the contract where such milestones fairly reflect progress toward contract completion 
revenue related to e marketing  lead management  multi channel customer care  inbound and outbound teleservices and technical support is typically billed based on a set price per transaction or service provided 
revenue from these services is recognized as the service or activity is performed 
revenue from software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the respective elements 
for software sales with multiple elements for example  software licenses with undelivered post contract customer support or pcs  the company allocates revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means the company defers revenue from the software sale equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the fair value of pcs is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
the fair value of services  such as training and consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 

table of contents the revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenue allocated to professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
the revenue allocated to software products  including time based software licenses  is recognized  if collection is probable  upon execution of a licensing agreement and shipment of the software or ratably over the term of the license  depending on the structure and terms of the arrangement

allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains its allowance for doubtful accounts at a balance adequate to reduce accounts receivable to the amount of cash expected to be realized upon collection 
the methodology used to determine the minimum allowance balance is based on the company s prior collection experience and is generally related to the accounts receivable balance in various aging categories 
the balance is also influenced by specific customers financial strength and circumstance 
accounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible 
periodic changes to the allowance balance are recorded as increases or decreases to bad debt expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company recorded bad debt expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while the company believes its reserve estimate to be appropriate  the company may find it necessary to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts if future bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve

the company has a  deductible for automobile and general liability claims 
the company s deductible for workers compensation decreased from million to  in october management makes various subjective judgments about a number of factors in determining the company s reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance  and the related expense

the amount that earnings would be impacted is dependent on the claim year and the company s deductible levels for that plan year

goodwill goodwill is recorded to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   goodwill was being amortized on a straight line basis over to year periods 
beginning january   goodwill is no longer being amortized  but instead is tested for impairment as discussed below 
the company assesses the impairment of its goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 by determining the fair value of each of its reporting units and comparing the fair value to the carrying value for each reporting 
table of contents unit 
the company has identified its reporting units as direct marketing and shoppers 
fair value is determined using projected discounted future cash flows and cash flow multiple models  based on historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the company must calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities recognized and unrecognized in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  and then compare this implied fair value to its carrying amount 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded 
both the direct marketing and shoppers segments are tested for impairment as of november of each year  after the annual forecasting process for the upcoming fiscal year has been completed 
the company has not recorded an impairment loss in any of the three years ended december  significant estimates utilized in the company s discounted cash flow model include weighted average cost of capital and the long term rate of growth for each of the company s reporting segments 
these estimates require management s judgment 
any significant changes in key assumptions about the company s businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could have an impact on this annual analysis 
at december  and  the company s goodwill balance was million  net of million of accumulated amortization  and million  net of million of accumulated amortization  respectively 
based upon the company s analysis  the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units as of december  was well in excess of the reporting units carrying values 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements by senior management  the company may express its expectations regarding its future performance 
these forward looking statements are inherently uncertain  and investors should realize that events could turn out to be other than what senior management expected 
set forth below are some key factors that could affect the company s future performance  including its revenues  net income and earnings per share  however  the risks described below are not the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known  or that the company currently considers immaterial  could also impair the company s business operations 
legislation  judicial interpretations  consumer environment there could be a material adverse impact on the company s business due to the enactment of legislation or industry regulations  the issuance of judicial interpretations  or simply a change in customs  arising from public concern over consumer privacy issues 
restrictions could be placed upon the collection  management  aggregation and use of information that is legally available  which could result in a material increase in the cost of collecting some kinds of data 
it is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data  which could in turn materially adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements 
data suppliers there could be a material adverse impact on the company s direct marketing business if owners of the data the company uses were to withdraw the data 
data providers could withdraw their data if there is a competitive reason to do so or if additional legislation is passed restricting the use of the data 
acquisitions the company continues to pursue acquisition opportunities 
acquisition activities  even if not consummated  require substantial amounts of management time and can distract from normal operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the synergies and other objectives sought in acquisitions would be achieved 
the company believes that it will be able to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses into existing 
table of contents operations but there is no certainty that future acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms or that any acquired assets  data or businesses will be successfully integrated into the company s operations 
the failure to identify appropriate candidates  to negotiate favorable terms  or to successfully integrate future acquisitions into existing operations could result in decreased revenues  net income and earnings per share 
competition direct marketing is a rapidly evolving business  subject to periodic technological advancements  high turnover of customer personnel who make buying decisions  and changing customer needs and preferences 
consequently  the company s direct marketing business faces competition in all of its offerings and within each of its vertical markets 
the company s shoppers business competes for advertising  as well as for readers  with other print and electronic media 
competition comes from local and regional newspapers  magazines  radio  broadcast and cable television  shoppers  other communications media and other advertising printers that operate in the company s markets 
the extent and nature of such competition are  in large part  determined by the location and demographics of the markets targeted by a particular advertiser  and the number of media alternatives in those markets 
failure to continually improve the company s current processes and to develop new products and services could result in the loss of the company s customers to current or future competitors 
in addition  failure to gain market acceptance of new products and services could adversely affect the company s growth 
qualified personnel the company believes that its future prospects will depend in large part upon its ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled technical  client services and administrative personnel 
while dependent on employment levels and general economic conditions  qualified personnel historically have been in great demand and from time to time and in the foreseeable future will likely remain a limited resource 
postal rates the company s shoppers and direct marketing services depend on the united states postal service to deliver products 
the company s shoppers are delivered by standard mail  and postage is the second largest expense  behind payroll  in the company s shopper business 
standard postage rates have been unchanged since the beginning of the third quarter of  and it is anticipated the next increase in postage rates will occur in overall shoppers postage costs are expected to grow as a result of anticipated increases in circulation and insert volumes 
postal rates also influence the demand for the company s direct marketing services even though the cost of mailings is borne by the company s customers and is not directly reflected in the company s revenues or expenses 
paper prices paper represents a substantial expense in the company s shoppers operations 
in recent years newsprint prices have fluctuated widely  and such fluctuations can materially affect the results of the company s operations 
economic conditions changes in national economic conditions can affect levels of advertising expenditures generally  and such changes can affect each of the company s businesses 
in addition  revenues from the company s shoppers business are dependent to a large extent on local advertising expenditures in the markets in which they operate 
such expenditures are substantially affected by the strength of the local economies in those markets 
direct marketing revenues are dependent on national and international economies 
interest rates interest rate movements in europe and the united states can affect the amount of interest the company pays related to its debt and the amount it earns on cash equivalents 
the company s primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in europe  specifically eurolibor rates due to their impact on interest related to the company s million credit facility 
the company also has exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically money market  commercial paper and overnight time deposit rates as these affect the company s earnings on its excess cash

in addition  exchange rate movements may have an impact on the company s future costs or on future cash flows from foreign investments 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
additional risks inherent in the company s non us business activities generally include  among others  potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights 
the various risks that are inherent in doing business in the united states are also generally applicable to doing business outside of the united states  and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture  laws and regulations 
war war and or terrorism or the threat of war and or terrorism involving the united states could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
war or the threat of war could substantially affect the levels of advertising expenditures by clients in each of the company s businesses
