for a discussion of the important risks related to our business and future operating performance  see the discussion under the caption item business risks related to our business and under the caption factors which may influence future results of operations below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of products includes g wireless pc card modems  embedded modems  ruggedized modems and communications software  which we sell principally to wireless network operators and to a lesser extent  distributors  original equipment manufacturers oems  and vertical markets worldwide 
we are currently developing multimedia application consoles for wide area and local area networks 
through the integration of our hardware and software  our products are designed to operate on wireless networks throughout the world and provide mobile subscribers with secure and convenient high speed access to corporate  public and personal information through the internet and enterprise networks 
we also offer software engineering  integration and design services to our customers to facilitate the use of our products 
during  we reached profitability for the first time since our inception and recorded net income applicable to common stockholders for the year ending december  of million 
historically  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  and to recruit and train personnel for our product development and sales and marketing departments 
in the past  our operating expenses have exceeded the revenue generated by our products and services 
as a result  we incurred losses in each quarter since inception through the fourth quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and working capital of million 
since our inception in  we have been focused on the development and commercialization of technologies that allow for wireless access to data 
we expanded our operations in advance of the launch of several new products in the late s through beginning in  in response to the decline in the telecommunications industry  we implemented an operational and organizational restructuring to increase operating efficiency and conserve working capital 
these restructuring activities included facility consolidations  reduction of employee staff  consultants and temporary labor and critical assessments of asset impairment and obsolete inventory 
for and  we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of approximately  and million  respectively 
no restructuring and impairment charges were incurred during beginning in early  we also aggressively pursued the development of innovative g products  refocused our research and development efforts on sales driven customer needs and focused our sales  marketing and distribution efforts on large wireless operators and related companies 
these efforts have contributed to an increase in our gross margin from a negative million for to a positive gross margin of million for  and an improvement in our gross margin percentage from negative in to positive for the year ended december  we also reduced our operating loss from million for to an operating loss of million for and recorded operating income of million for 
table of contents factors which may influence future results of operations we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products and this may place significant demands on our resources 
revenue 
we believe that our revenue growth will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the increase in demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g products and g data access services  particularly in europe  north america and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following demand for broadband access services and networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  loss of significant customers  drop in demand for cdma  evdo and umts products  and change in technologies 
we began shipping our first g products in december we have shipped three new g products since then and anticipate introducing additional g products during in the future  we may enter into customer contracts for development services  but not at significant levels in relation to total revenue 
certain end customers have purchased our products through our strategic relationships with lucent technologies 
cost of revenue 
we currently outsource our manufacturing operations on various products to lg innotek  celestica and commencing in  to sercomm 
all costs associated with these manufacturers are included in our cost of revenue 
cost of revenue also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible licenses  royalty payments based on a percentage of revenue  operations group expenses  costs related to development services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
during and  we recorded inventory write downs of million and million  respectively  due to the decrease in demand for certain of our products 
we expect to continue to outsource our manufacturing operations  and as our business grows we expect our manufacturing activity to increase 
operating expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in europe  north america and asia 
if these markets continue to grow  we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses associated with such new product development 
we have in the past and expect to continue in future periods to incur these expenses in periods prior to recognizing revenue from these contracts 
in addition  the portion of our revenue derived from international sales has increased  requiring an expansion of our sales and marketing efforts and logistics support in these markets 
the accounting for stock options beginning in the third quarter of will require us to use the fair value method to account for all stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r  which will significantly increase our operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  useful lives  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  the use of option pricing models to establish values of equity instruments  the valuation of long lived assets and estimates for costs recorded in restructuring and royalty accruals 

table of contents revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from the sale of our broadband wireless access solutions principally to wireless operators and to a lesser extent  to oem customers and distributors 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the later of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
for product sales with acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized at such time that the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
we record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of product shipments 
we establish reserves for estimated product returns allowance in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future product returns  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated return policies and practices and our historical trends 
for our fixed price development services contracts  we recognize revenue as services are rendered using labor costs as an input measure 
if the contract includes milestones  we do not recognize revenue until the milestone criteria are met 
total estimated costs are based on management s assessment of costs to complete the project including periodic assessments of the progress achieved and the costs expended to date 
to the extent that our estimated costs materially change  our revenue and profit recorded under the associated contract is adjusted accordingly 
if total costs of completion are estimated to exceed the contract value  a loss is recognized in the period the loss is identified 
during  we amended a joint development agreement containing multiple elements with one of our customers including development services and product shipments 
accordingly  we have separated the deliverables into units of accounting and allocated arrangement consideration to these deliverables in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 million in cash payments received in was deferred and is being recognized as revenue when products are shipped or as development services are performed 
during  we recognized approximately million of this deferred revenue  with the remaining  expected to be recognized during the first half of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide an allowance against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customer s credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand as discussed under revenue above  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
we believe that the estimates we use in calculating the inventory reserve are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially different from our estimates  adjustments to our inventory reserve may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one year or two year coverage for products following the 
table of contents date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency of claims and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual warranty costs 
we have not experienced significant warranty expenses to date 
future expenses could be different  depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing quality 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to the fair value  which is determined using a discounted cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over relatively short periods  typically three to five years 
this reduces the risk of large impairment charges in any given period 
however  most of these assets are associated with technology that changes rapidly and such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
royalty costs 
we have license agreements which commit us to royalty payments generally based on a percentage of the sales of our products using certain technologies 
we recognize royalty obligations in accordance with terms of the respective royalty agreements 
we have accrued for royalty costs where agreements have not been finalized using our current best estimate of our obligation 
these estimates are based on various market data information and other relevant information 
when the agreements are finalized  we will revise our estimates accordingly 
income taxes 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax authorities 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million had been recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements

the provision for income taxes was approximately  for our estimated effective tax rate used for was 
the difference between the federal and state statutory rate of and our effective tax rate is due primarily to the change in the valuation allowance on our net operating loss carryforwards in and research and development credits generated in net income loss

in  development services revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue due to specific development projects related to the development of our new umts products 
we do not expect development services revenue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the foreseeable future 
cost of revenue

interest expense increased by million to million compared to  for the increase was attributable to interest of million associated with the convertible notes issued and converted in  net of a decrease in bank finance charges and interest on capital leases 
the interest expense associated with the convertible notes was a result of the proceeds of the convertible notes allocated to the beneficial conversion feature and related warrants 
because all the convertible notes were converted into series b preferred stock during  we recognized interest expense equal to the remaining value of the beneficial conversion feature and related warrants  which otherwise would have been ratably accreted over the term of the notes 
net loss 
the net loss for decreased million  or  to million compared to million for for the reasons stated above 
liquidity and capital resources during the  we reached profitability for the first time since our inception and recorded net income applicable to common shareholders of million for the fiscal year ended december  we had previously incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products  which exceeded total revenue 
as a result  we had incurred losses in each year since inception through the end of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and working capital of million 
in may  we completed an underwritten equity offering transaction  raising approximately million  net of offering costs and underwriters commissions of approximately million  upon the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in january  we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  net of fees to the placement agent and offering costs  from the issuance of  shares of common stock in a private placement transaction 
warrants to acquire  common shares at a price of  expiring on january   were also issued in conjunction with this offering 
during  we received aggregate proceeds of approximately million in connection with the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of certain outstanding warrants and stock options 
historical cash flows net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to approximately million for compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately  for this increase was primarily attributable to million net income recorded for the fiscal year ended december   compared to our net loss from million in the net income includes million of depreciation and amortization expenses 
the increase was also attributable to an increase in accrued expenses of million  offset by an increase in our inventory balance of million  a decrease in our deferred revenue balance of million and an increase in our accounts receivable balance of million 
the increase in our accounts receivable and inventory balances are primarily due to the growth of our business and the expected increased demand for our product 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for was approximately million compared to  used in investing activities in the cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to the net purchases of marketable securities of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and purchases of licensed technologies of million 
the cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to the purchases of licensed technologies 
net cash provided from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared to million during the same period in the cash provided from financing activities in was due to the net proceeds of million received from a secondary offering equity transaction that was completed in may  million from the january issuance of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants of million  offset by capital lease obligation payments of approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities in was million which was due to net proceeds of million received from the exercise of common stock options and warrants  million of net proceeds from the issuance of series b convertible preferred stock and million of net proceeds received on the issuance of convertible notes payable 
current sources of capital and liquidity as of december   we had working capital of million and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by fiscal year total capital lease and other obligations operating leases committed purchase orders total contractual cash obligations other liquidity needs during the next twelve months we plan to incur approximately million to million for the acquisition of additional software licenses and for capital expenditures 
in addition  certain of our operating leases related to consolidated facilities obligate us to pay an aggregate of approximately million  net of sublease income  over the next months 
this obligation is included in the operating lease commitment in the above table 
we believe that our available cash reserves together with our budgeted operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund operations  including the continued expansion of our sales and marketing team  the further development of our new products and the related increase in our general and administrative expenses  and to satisfy our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we expect that our significant source of funds in the future will be our operating cash flow 
our future revenue is dependent on us fulfilling our commitments in accordance with agreements with a small number of major customers 
our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption to our business operations  a material failure to satisfy these contractual commitments or a failure to generate additional revenue from new or existing products 

table of contents backlog we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered to wireless operators  who in turn sell our products to their customers  and our dependency on evolving wireless network standards 
therefore  we believe that backlog information is not relevant to an understanding of our overall business 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
this statement supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas  however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements for sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits companies to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we currently utilize the black scholes model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees under the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas while sfas r permits companies to continue to use such model  it also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which method or model we will use to record and measure the fair value of employee stock options under the adoption for sfas r 
the new standard is effective for periods beginning after june   and we expect to adopt sfas r on july  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method is expected to result in significant non cash charges which will increase our reported cost of sales and operating expenses  however  it will have no impact on our cash flows 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future and the model we choose to use 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb released revised fasb statement no 
sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
the new standard requires amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the requirements of the standard will be effective for inventory costs incurred during the fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the adoption of sfas but do not expect that it will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits our credit exposure to any single issuer 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of million of our cash and cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the remaining million of our investments by approximately million 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment 
foreign currency exchange rate risk substantially all of our sales through december  have been denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced any significant foreign currency gains or losses related to our revenues 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into sales transactions denominated in euros 
in order to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our receivable balances we have entered into a forward foreign exchange contract 
the effect of exchange rate changes on forward foreign exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items 
we believe this financial instrument does not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december   our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all of our outstanding foreign currency contracts are marked to market  with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of other income and expense 
as of december  the total amount of outstanding forward contracts amounted to million euros 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded an unrealized loss of  on our forward contracts 
for the fiscal year ended december   we had a foreign currency loss of  recorded in other income and expense related to our restructuring accrual denominated in canadian dollars 
revenues generated outside the united states denominated in us dollars  as a percentage of total revenues were for the fiscal year ended december  and for the same period in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could impact future operating results
