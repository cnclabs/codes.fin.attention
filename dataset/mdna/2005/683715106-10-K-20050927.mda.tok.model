overview about open text open text is one of the market leaders in providing enterprise content management ecm solutions that bring together people  processes and information 
the company s software combines collaboration with content management  transforming information into knowledge that provides the foundation for innovation  compliance and accelerated growth 
the company s legacy of innovation began in with the successful deployment of the world s first search engine technology for the internet 
today  open text supports approximately million seats across  deployments in countries and languages worldwide 
market trends over the past year the company has witnessed numerous changes to the social political landscape that have had significant impacts on the ecm market 
events over the past several years such as the september th terrorist attacks  the financial collapse of high profile us corporations such as enron and worldcom  as well as ensuing changes to the regulatory environment such as sarbanes oxley and the patriot act have placed a significant onus on the private and public sectors alike to adopt compliance driven software solutions 
the volume of unstructured data being generated in organizations today is overwhelming and is growing exponentially 
this situation creates a significant challenge to physically manage the storage of this content  to operationally manage the content so that it adds value back to the organization  and to legally manage the content to ensure compliance  security  and protection of intellectual property 
email archiving and management has emerged as a key solution within ecm and is seen as a significant opportunity by most ecm vendors 

table of contents the content and volume of email in a company is becoming one of the greatest business challenges today 
idc  a provider of market intelligence  advisory services  and events for the information technology and telecommunications industries  predicted that the number of email messages would grow from million a day in to billion in this is causing the following business challenges overtaxed email and file servers  increased system downtime  expensive infrastructure overhead and administration  reduced employee productivity  and exposure to corporate compliance risks 
open text s email archiving solutions provide the ability to manually or automatically offload emails and attachments from microsoft exchange or lotus domino servers without adversely affecting the email experience of employees 
by migrating email content to more cost effective media  organizations can alleviate growing demand for storage space  improve mail server performance  and simplify backup and restore procedures 
simultaneously  more organizations continue to focus their attention on the preservation of their intellectual property and the knowledge residing throughout their workforces 
with baby boomers retiring  corporations have only recently become sensitive to the fact that a high percentage of the knowledge of their workforces may not be documented or archived in any organized fashion which future employees can retrieve 
ecm software is designed to solve these business needs 
according to gartner  a provider of research and analysis about the global information technology industry  the ecm market will exceed billion in software revenue in  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
they expect that this growth will be driven by companies increasing need to manage content at the enterprise level 
although the company recognizes the potential of the ecm market  user adoption of ecm has yet to reach an inflection point 
various reasons cited include a constrained it budgets  b unanticipated increased spending on sarbanes oxley and other regulatory matters to consulting and service organizations  c avoiding larger more strategic ecm purchase decisions due to organizational challenges and initial time constraints 
consistent with experience over the past several years  the company does not expect total information technology spending to increase in the near term 
this means that the growth in ecm will continue to come at the expense of standalone markets that ecm has subsumed and other parts of the it market 
one area within information technology spending which companies are not reducing spending  and in many cases are increasing spending  is compliance focused software 
companies are not able to defer spending to become or remain compliant with the regulatory environments they operate within 
the company is focused on capitalizing on this opportunity  particularly given the fact that compliance touches all employees in an organization 
as a result  compliance opportunities can evolve into enterprise wide deployments 
consolidation and acquisitions the ecm sector has been marked by significant consolidation over the past several years 
sophisticated customers are demanding more robust suites of technology and are building out a long term strategy to address all aspects of ecm 
in previous years customers often purchased individual functionalities point solutions from separate vendors and then attempted to integrate these point solutions at the customer site 
the largest  most financially stable vendors have taken advantage of their financial position by acquiring many of their smaller competitors in an attempt to enhance their product line 
these smaller vendors will continue to be under increased pressure as ecm technologies become mission critical 
the company expects customers will continue 
table of contents to show hesitancy to purchase from any vendor whose financial viability is in question 
in many cases  these smaller vendors have what is regarded as leading technology  but they lack the financial resources to convince customers that they will remain in business to support and enhance their products for years to come 
product breadth  ease of implementation  rapid deployment of solutions and financial stability of the vendor are critical 
through internal development and the company s acquisition strategy  the company has created a broad product line to offer to new and existing customers 
in fiscal  the company made three acquisitions 
in august  open text acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of artesia technologies  inc artesia for cash consideration of million 
artesia designs and distributes digital asset management software 
it has a customer base of over companies and provides these customers and their marketing and distribution partners the ability to easily access and collaborate around a centrally managed collection of digital media elements 
the results of operations of artesia have been consolidated with those of open text beginning september  in august  open text acquired the vista plus vista suite of products and related assets from quest software inc quest for cash consideration of million 
vista is a technology that captures and stores business critical information from erp applications 
as part of this transaction certain quest employees that developed  sold and supported vista have been employed by open text 
the revenues and costs related to the vista product suite have been consolidated with those of open text beginning september  in february  open text acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of optura inc optura for cash consideration of million 
optura offers products and integration services that optimize business processes so that companies can collaborate across separate organizational functions  dissimilar systems and business partners 
optura products and services will enable open text customers  who use a sap based enterprise resource planning erp system  to improve the efficiencies of their document based erp processes 
the results of operations of optura have been consolidated with those of open text beginning february  open text has increased its ownership of ixos to approximately during the year ended june  this was done by way of open market purchases of ixos shares 
prior to these purchases  as of june   the company held approximately of the outstanding shares of ixos 
total consideration of million was paid for the purchase of ixos shares during the year ended june  on january   ixos shareholders voted to delist the shares from the german stock exchange 
this delisting became effective on july  subsequently  the domination agreement for ixos has been officially registered with the company s intent to purchase the remaining ixos minority shareholder interests 
in october  open text acquired all the common shares of ser solutions software gmbh and ser egovernment deutschland gmbh together domea egovernment for a total consideration of million 
the purchase price included contingent consideration that could have been earned by the former shareholders of domea egovernment based on the achievement of certain revenue targets through december  the revenue targets were achieved and accordingly an aggregate amount of million was recorded in the year ended june   as due and payable to the former shareholders of domea egovernment and was paid in cash on july  and in shares on september open text continues to seek opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies that expand  complement or are otherwise related to the company s current business 
in the near future  the focus of such acquisition opportunities is expected to be on smaller organizations with specific vertical market expertise that can be strategically leveraged 
the company also considers  from time to time  opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments 

table of contents sales strategy the company anticipates that it will continue to develop and market ecm related solutions to global organizations with an emphasis on addressing specific problems and specific industries 
operationally  the company has solutions and sales teams that focus entirely on industry specific or cross industry line of business markets 
the company has key sales teams that focus on the following sectors government  pharmaceutical and life sciences  financial services  oil and gas  and the media and entertainment sectors 
the company feels that customized livelink ecm solutions designed specifically for each of these sectors address specific mission critical problems that such organizations confront 
open text continues to focus on selling to its large user installed base  as it is an important source for sales opportunities 
moreover  the company has integrated the technology and domain expertise from recent acquisitions  which represents new selling opportunities in the respective customer bases  wherein existing relationships can lead to new sales in other areas of the business 
the company believes the presence of such deployments will significantly enhance its ability to be regarded as the preferred ecm vendor of choice for a specific customer  when that customer is ready to make such a strategic move and to consolidate some or all of its component systems 
during fiscal  the company experienced a change in the purchasing behavior of its ecm customers 
where customers had traditionally focused on collaborative functionalities when making initial software purchases  they began  in  to look at comprehensive solutions for managing all of their enterprise content 
additionally  purchase decisions became more heavily weighted on archiving and managing records of enterprise content 
the company believes this change in purchasing behavior is a direct result of customer demand to meet compliance requirements 
this type of initial sale is newer  and larger  for the company  in terms of both the purchase amount and number of users that will deploy the software 
this trend has resulted in longer sales cycles that could be months or longer  driven both by the increased size of some of these transactions as well as a lengthened approval process by the customer 
this is in contrast to past years where initial  limited scope deployments with shorter sales cycles evolved into larger deployments 
the company will continue to place emphasis on refining its sales strategies to manage the changing patterns in customer demand 
in open text s experience  ecm software has generally not faced pricing pressures when configured and marketed for specific business solutions 
rather  pricing of ecm solutions has remained stable as buyers place added value on software that will address their industry specific needs 
however  the price point of certain ecm technology components is predictably eroding  following the natural commoditization of information technology 
in view of this  the company will continue to bundle its software components into larger solutions providing tangible returns for its customers 
competitive advantage historically  the company has actively sold and marketed its products based on a superior return on investment and yet at a lower total cost of ownership compared to other products offered by competing vendors 
the fact that the livelink ecm product line is highly configurable without end user programming means that as soon as it is purchased  an organization can have it deployed almost immediately 
by contrast  many competitive products and solutions require a significant amount of expensive  customized programming and service work  adding not only cost  but also time to the deployment cycle 
open text s ecm products also have a competitive advantage of proven scalability in organizations of  or more users 
this scalability advantage is a direct result of livelink ecm s initial design and development to operate on the web 
this gives the company a direct advantage over competitive products that began as client server based architecture which is an architecture that is inherently harder to scale 
the competitive landscape has evolved over the past year as new vendors attempt to try and penetrate the ecm market 
microsoft s sharepoint product has experienced significant recent adoption 
however 
table of contents sharepoint is focused on departmental use rather than enterprise wide deployment  and the product does not possess the scalability of livelink ecm 
although sharepoint competes with some historical aspects of the company s business around team workspaces  it also creates new opportunities for the company around the long term lifecycle management of that sharepoint content 
on august  the company announced a partnership with microsoft to address these opportunities by offering ecm archiving solutions specially designed for sharepoint users 
open text also continues to compete with traditional competitors such as emc s documentum  where document centric requirements dominate  and with filenet where business process requirements dominate 
ibm continues to broaden its ecm capabilities  but is doing so in the context of its websphere and db products in the hope of driving their vast integration and professional services business 
the company feels that its key strategic advantages over its competition are the comprehensive scope of its ecm offering  its rapid deployment capabilities which reduce total cost of ownership  the integration maturity and scalability of its core ecm components  its customer centric approach  and its financial viability 
customers open text supports approximately million seats across  deployments in countries and languages worldwide 
the company s customer base is diversified by industry and geography  the result of a continued focus on licensing to the  largest global organizations as the primary target market 
in fiscal  open text issued press releases for its significant customer related transactions as listed below in july  the university of southern california s information sciences institute usc isi selected the company s software as the foundation for its web content management strategy

some of the more significant strategic alliances that the company has secured are microsoft  sap  deloitte  and accenture 
open text has worked with sap  for two decades  creating integrated solutions that enable users to create  access  manage  and securely archive sap content  data and documents 
these solutions address stringent requirements for risk reduction  operational efficiency  and it consolidation 
with the acquisition of documentum by storage vendor emc corporation  other storage vendors have taken initiatives to partner with independent ecm providers 
open text has strengthened its relationships with key storage vendors such as hitachi data systems  storagetek  and hewlett packard company and the company continues to maintain an active relationship with emc corporation 
these relationships allow third party storage vendors to license livelink ecm to both their existing customer base and broaden their product offerings when competing with other storage vendors for new customer accounts

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap necessarily requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company re evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed at the time to be reasonable under the circumstances 
under different assumptions or conditions  the actual results will differ  potentially materially  from those previously estimated 
many of the conditions impacting these assumptions and estimates are outside of the company s control 
open text believes that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding its business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection and application of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors  and the company s audit committee has reviewed its disclosure relating to its critical accounting policies in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding the company s consolidated financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to the company s accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
the following critical accounting policies affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue open text currently derives all of its revenues from licenses of software products and related services 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require the company to 
table of contents make significant judgments 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and to the extent applicable  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
product license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable and supported and the arrangement does not require additional services to be delivered that are essential to the functionality of the software 
i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the company determines that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists with respect to a customer under a an executed license agreement  which is signed by both the customer and the company  or b a purchase order  quote or binding letter of intent received from and signed by the customer  in which case the customer has either previously executed a license agreement with the company or will receive a shrink wrap license agreement with the software 
open text does not offer product return rights to end users or resellers 
ii delivery has occurred the software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
the company determines that delivery has occurred upon shipment of the software pursuant to the billing terms of the arrangement or when the software is made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
customer acceptance generally occurs at shipment 
iii the fee is fixed or determinable if at the outset of the customer arrangement  the company determines that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is typically recognized when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
iv collectibility is probable the company determines whether collectibility is probable on a case by case basis 
the company generates a high percentage of license revenue from the current customer base  for which there is a history of successful collection 
the company assesses the probability of collection from new customers based upon the number of years the customer has been in business and a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if the company is unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon the review process  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
with regard to software arrangements involving multiple elements  the company allocates revenue to each element in the arrangement using the residual value approach 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
all of the elements included in the multiple element arrangements have been analyzed and it has been determined that there is sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to consulting services and to post contract customer support pcs components of the license arrangements 
the company sells consulting services separately  and it has established vsoe for these services on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the respective term of the maintenance contract  typically one year 
service revenues consist of revenues from consulting  implementation  training and integration services 
these services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services 
for those contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction  the company determines vsoe of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these 
table of contents services when sold separately 
these consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are  on average  less than six months in length 
revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are rendered as the time is incurred by the company 
the company also occasionally enters into contracts that are primarily fixed fee arrangements to render specific consulting services 
the percentage of completion method is applied to these more complex contracts that involve the provision of services relating to the design or building of complex systems  because these services are essential to the functionality of other elements in the arrangement 
under this method  the percentage of completion is calculated based on actual hours incurred compared to the estimated total hours for the services under the arrangement 
for those fixed fee contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element  the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
purchase price allocations in business combinations the company has a history of acquiring other businesses  and expects that this trend will likely continue in the future 
as part of the completion of any business combination  the company is required to value  amongst other opening balance sheet items  any intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets include acquired technology and customer relationships 
acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions 
acquired technology is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer relationships represent relationships that are with certain customers on contractual or legal rights and are considered separable 
these contractual relationships were acquired by open text through business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
contractual relationships are amortized over their useful lives 
the valuation of these assets is inherently subjective  and necessarily involves judgments and estimates regarding future cash flows and other operational variables of the entity acquired 
there can be no assurance that the judgments and estimates made at the date of acquisition will reflect future performance of the acquired entity 
if management makes judgments or estimates that differ from actual circumstances  open text may be required to write off certain of its intangible assets 
the company continually evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the company tests long lived assets or asset groups  such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets  for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 

table of contents recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
an impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
similarly  in accordance with fasb sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company is required to annually test the value of goodwill 
this testing requires management to make estimates of the market value of its various reporting units 
changes in estimates could result in different conclusions for the value of goodwill 
the company performs the annual impairment testing on goodwill on april of each fiscal year  provided that circumstances do not arise during the year that would necessitate an earlier evaluation 
over the past two years  the value of the reporting units has exceeded their book value 
based on currently available information  management does not anticipate that an impairment of goodwill will occur in the foreseeable future  although there can be no assurances that at the time a future review is completed  a material impairment charge will not be required and recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts open text maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments 
the company evaluates the credit worthiness of its customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations  adjusts credit limits to the respective customers 
in addition to these evaluations  the company conducts on going credit evaluations of the customers payment history and current credit worthiness 
the allowance is maintained for of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and  for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible  an allowance is maintained for a specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts  its historical collection experience and current economic expectations 
to date  the actual losses have been within management expectations 
no single customer accounted for more than of the accounts receivable balance as of june  and actual collections could differ materially from the company s estimates 
income taxes open text accounts for income taxes in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
these temporary differences are measured using the enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that management considers it is more likely than not  that such a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
in addition  the company is subject to examinations by taxation authorities of the jurisdictions in which it operates in the normal course of operations 
the company regularly assesses the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision of income and other taxes 
restructuring charges open text records restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other exit costs in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires recognition of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 

table of contents the company records restructuring charges relating to employee termination costs in accordance with fasb sfas no 
accounting for post employment benefits sfas 
sfas applies to post employment benefits provided to employees under on going benefit arrangements 
in accordance with sfas  the company records such charges to restructuring  when the termination benefits are capable of being determined or estimated in advance from either the provisions of open text s policy or from past practices  the benefits are attributable to services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires management to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities  including estimating sublease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of 
at the end of each reporting period  the company evaluates the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances 
litigation the company is a party  from time to time  in legal proceedings

typically the company conducts due diligence prior to consummating an acquisition  however  the company s integration efforts may periodically expose deficiencies in the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired company 
the company expects that the process involved in completing the integration of the company s own disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired business will sufficiently correct any identified deficiencies 
however  if such deficiencies exist  the company may not be in a position to comply with its periodic reporting requirements and the company s business and financial condition may be materially harmed 

table of contents the length of the company s sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter because the decision by a customer to purchase the company s products often involves relatively large scale implementation across the customer s network or networks  licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers  accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures 
given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization in order to implement the company s software  the company s sales cycle tends to take considerable time to complete 
over the past fiscal year  the company has experienced a lengthening of its sales cycle as customers include more personnel in the decision making process and focus on more enterprise wide licensing deals 
in an economic environment of reduced information technology spending  it can take several months  or even quarters  for sales opportunities to translate into revenue 
if a customer s decision to license the company s software is delayed and the installation of the company s products in one or more customers takes longer than originally anticipated  the date on which revenue from these licenses could be recognized would be delayed 
such delays could cause the company s revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period 
the company s international operations expose the company to business risks that could cause the company s operating results to suffer open text intends to continue to make efforts to increase its international operations and anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue 
the company has increased its presence in the european market  especially since its acquisition of ixos 
these international operations are subject to certain risks and costs  including the difficulty and expense of administering business and compliance abroad  compliance with both domestic and foreign laws  compliance with domestic and international import and export laws and regulations  costs related to localizing products for foreign markets  and costs related to translating and distributing products in a timely manner 
international operations also tend to expose the company to a longer sales and collection cycle  as well as potential losses arising from currency fluctuations  and limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings 
significant international sales may also expose the company to greater risk from political and economic instability  unexpected changes in canadian  united states or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology  other regulatory requirements and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which could also materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
also  international expansion may be more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
as a result  if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  the company s operating results will suffer 
moreover  in any given quarter  exchange rates can impact revenue adversely 
the company s products may contain defects that could harm the company s reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues  and expose the company to litigation the company s products are highly complex and sophisticated and  from time to time  may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of commercial shipments  or  if discovered  the company may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  despite tests carried out by the company on all its products  the company may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which its products will operate and  as a result  the company may be unable to adequately detect design defects or software errors inherent in its products and which only become apparent when the products are installed in an end user s network 
the occurrence of errors and failures in the company s products could result in loss of  or delay in market acceptance of the company s products  and alleviating such errors and failures in the company s products could require significant expenditure of capital and other resources by the company 
the harm to the company s reputation resulting from product errors and failures would be damaging to the company 
the company regularly provides a warranty with its products and the financial impact of these warranty obligations may be significant in the future 
the company s agreements with its strategic partners and 
table of contents end users typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to claims  such as exclusions of all implied warranties and limitations on the availability of consequential or incidental damages 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect the company against claims and related liabilities and costs 
although the company maintains errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage  such coverage may not be adequate and all claims may not be covered 
accordingly  any such claim could negatively affect the company s financial condition 
other companies may claim that the company infringes their intellectual property  which could result in significant costs to defend and if the company is not successful could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits although the company does not believe that its products infringe on the rights of third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future  and any such assertions may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties 
such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
in particular  as software patents become more prevalent  it is possible that certain parties will claim that the company s products violate their patents 
such claims could be disruptive to the company s ability to generate revenue and may result in significantly increased costs as the company attempts to license the patents or rework its products to ensure that they are not in violation of the claimant s patents or dispute the claims 
any of the foregoing could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits 
the loss of licenses to use third party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect the company s business the company currently depends on certain third party software  the loss of which could result in increased costs of  or delays in  licenses of the company s products 
for a limited number of product modules  the company relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in its products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported  maintained  or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of license to use  or the inability of licensors to support  maintain  and enhance any of such software  could result in increased costs  delays  or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is developed or licensed  if at all  and integrated  and could adversely affect the company s business 
a reduction in the number or sales efforts by distributors could materially impact the company s revenues a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from the license of its products through third parties 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to maintain access to existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop 
the company may not be able to retain a sufficient number of its existing or future distributors 
distributors may also give higher priority to the sale of other products which could include products of competitors or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing the company s products 
the performance of third party distributors is largely outside the control of the company and the company is unable to predict the extent to which these distributors will be successful in marketing and licensing the company s products 
a reduction in sales efforts  a decline in the number of distributors  or the discontinuance of sales of the company s products by its distributors could lead to reduced revenue 
the company s success depends and will depend on its relationships with strategic partners the company relies on close cooperation with partners for product development  optimization  and sales 
if any of the company s partners should decide for any reason to terminate or scale back their cooperative efforts with the company  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected 

table of contents the company s expenses may not match anticipated revenues the company incurs operating expenses based upon anticipated revenue trends 
since a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
if these expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  in fiscal the company announced an initiative to restructure its operations with the intention of realizing cost savings in the future 
the company will continue to evaluate its operations  and may propose future restructuring actions as a result of changes in the marketplace  including the exit from less profitable operations or services no longer demanded by its customers 
any failure to successfully execute these initiatives  including any delay in effecting these initiatives  can have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company must continue to manage its growth or its operating results could be adversely affected over the past several years  open text has experienced growth in revenues  operating expenses  and product distribution channels 
in addition  open text s markets have continued to evolve at a rapid pace 
the company believes that continued growth in the breadth of its product lines and services and in the number of personnel  will be required in order to establish and maintain the company s competitive position 
moreover  the company has grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and continues to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of its business 
finally  the company has been subject to increased regulation  including various nasdaq rules and section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes  which has necessitated a significant use of company resources to comply on a timely basis 
open text s growth  coupled with the rapid evolution of the company s markets and the new heightened regulations  have placed  and are likely to continue to place  significant strains on its administrative and operational resources and increased demands on its internal systems  procedures and controls 
the company s administrative infrastructure  systems  procedures and controls may not adequately support the company s operations or compliance with such regulations  and the company s management may not be able to achieve the rapid  effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully penetrate the markets for the company s products and services and to successfully integrate any business acquisitions in the future to comply with all regulatory rules 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  or comply with such new regulations  the company s operating results will likely suffer and it may not be in a position to comply with its periodic reporting requirements or listing standards  which could result in the delisting of the company from the nasdaq 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related regulations could result in increased costs to the company recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of sarbanes and recent rules enacted and proposed by the sec and nasdaq  have resulted in increased costs to the company as it responds to the new requirements 
in particular  complying with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of section of sarbanes is resulting in increased internal costs and higher fees from the company s independent accounting firm 
the new rules also could make it more difficult for the company to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and the company may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors  on committees of its board of directors  or as executive officers 
the company cannot yet estimate the amount of total additional costs it may incur or the timing of such costs as it implements these new and proposed rules 

table of contents the company s products rely on the stability of various infrastructure software that  if not stable  could negatively impact the effectiveness of the company s products  resulting in harm to the reputation and business of the company developments of internet and intranet applications by open text depend on the stability  functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet  such as that of sun  hp  oracle  microsoft and others 
if weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist  the company may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses 
if the company is unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that the company s products do not meet customer needs or expectations  the company s business and reputation may be significantly harmed 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate which could materially impact the price of the company s common shares the company experiences  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results caused by many factors  including changes in the demand for the company s products  the introduction or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of enhancements or products  delays in the introduction of products or enhancements by the company or its competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  lengthening sales cycles  changes in the company s pricing policies or those of its competitors  delays involved in installing products with customers  the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed  the mix of products and services sold  the timing of restructuring charges taken in connection with acquisitions completed by the company  the mix of international and north american revenues  foreign currency exchange rates  acquisitions and general economic conditions 
a cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses or delays in installations of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in any particular quarter 
because of the impact of the timing of product introductions and the rapid evolution of the company s business and the markets it serves  the company cannot predict whether seasonal patterns experienced in the past will continue 
for these reasons  one should not rely on period to period comparisons of the company s financial results to forecast future performance 
it is likely that the company s quarterly revenue and operating results will vary significantly in the future and if a shortfall in revenue occurs or if operating costs increase significantly  the market price of its common shares could materially decline 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property could harm its ability to compete effectively the company is highly dependent on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights may not be successful 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain its proprietary rights 
the company  subject to those patents and patents pending as discussed in item i of part i  has generally not sought patent protection for its products 
while us and canadian copyright laws  international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of canada or the united states 
software piracy has been  and can be expected to be  a persistent problem for the software industry 
enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights may be difficult  particularly in some nations outside of the united states and canada in which the company seeks to market its products 
despite the precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties  including competitors  to copy certain portions of the company s products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 

table of contents if the company is not able to attract and retain top employees  the company s ability to compete may be harmed the company s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm the company s business 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of its employees 
the company s success is also highly dependent on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train  retain and motivate highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel  including recently hired officers and other employees 
specifically  the recruitment of top research developers  along with experienced salespeople  remains critical to the company s success 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company may not be able to attract  integrate or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the volatility of the company s stock price could lead to losses by shareholders the market price of the common shares has been highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations in market price may continue in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events or factors 
in addition  the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies or have resulted from the failure of the operating results of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter 
broad market fluctuations or any failure of the company s operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of the common shares  resulting in losses to shareholders 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company 
due to the volatility of the company s stock price  the company could be the target of securities litigation in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities the company is subject to income taxes and non income taxes in a variety of jurisdictions and its tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities 
the determination of the company s worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment 
although the company believes its estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in its financial statements and may materially affect its financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates

some of the securities that the company has invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in the prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended june  would have been a decrease of approximately million 
foreign currency risk businesses generally conduct transactions in their local currency which is also generally their functional currency  or currency in which transactions are measured in their stand alone financial statements 
additionally  balances that are denominated in a currency other than the entity s reporting currency must be adjusted to reflect changes in foreign exchange rates during the reporting period 
as the company operates internationally  a substantial portion of its business is also conducted in foreign currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  the company s results are affected  and may be affected in the future  by exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  to various european currencies  and  to a lesser extent  other foreign currencies 
revenues and expenses generated in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates during the month in which the transaction occurs 
the company cannot predict the effect of foreign exchange losses in the future  however  if significant foreign exchange losses are experienced  they could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and financial condition 
moreover  in any given quarter  exchange rates can impact revenue adversely 
the company has net monetary asset and liability balances in foreign currencies other than the us dollar  including the canadian dollar cdn  the pound sterling gbp  the australian dollar aud  the swiss franc chf  the danish kroner dkk  the arabian dirham aed  and the euro eur
