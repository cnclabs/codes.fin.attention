item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company owns  operates  invests in  markets and remarkets equipment  primarily in the offshore oil and gas and marine transportation industries 
it also provides emergency environmental response  remediation  and related services 
we conduct our activities in four business segments offshore marine services is a worldwide provider of offshore energy marine support services with a fleet of vessels  with helicopters  helicopter services also primarily services the offshore energy markets with operations in the gulf of mexico and a small presence in alaska 
it also leases helicopters to third parties 
inland river services operates over  dry cargo and chemical tank barges throughout the us inland waterways 
environmental services is an international provider of oil spill response and preparedness services and also provides services to ships calling at us ports  oil facilities  and installations 
offshore marine services  helicopter services and inland river services are highly capital intensive businesses 
to manage these businesses successfully over time  the company believes it is often necessary to re allocate capital among different classes of assets and across a variety of industries 
in recent years  the company has been pursuing a policy of diversifying its asset base by allocating capital into assets with differing cyclical profiles 
to pursue this strategy  the company manages its assets aggressively  responding quickly to opportunities to deploy or trade those assets 
we believe that maintaining liquidity is important to provide the resources necessary to take advantage of opportunities 
our overall capital commitment to assets in the offshore oil and gas industry has remained fairly constant over the last three years 
we believe that demand for both our marine and helicopter services in the offshore oil and gas industry will improve in the next year 
the market for offshore oil and gas drilling has historically been cyclical 
in  activity in the offshore oil and gas industry markets worldwide began to decline and that downturn continued through the first half of offshore drilling activity improved in the second half of starting in the third quarter demand for support services began to improve 
that improvement carried through to the fourth quarter 
the company expects offshore drilling activity to be sustained in and likely to continue into in the past  increased offshore drilling has been positive for marine support vessel operators as well as helicopter operators serving the offshore markets 
the company expects this historical link to lead to increased vessel and helicopter support activity 
the company continually assesses its asset portfolio and is active in buying and selling second hand equipment  as well as building and re selling newly constructed equipment 
in the last few years many older assets have been shed and the fleet mix has been adjusted 
the acquisition of era s helicopters has made the company s rotary wing fleet one of the largest serving the offshore energy business in the gulf of mexico 
the acquisition will also diversify the company s service mix  adding firefighting capability and other services 
while the company will be providing flight seeing services in alaska during the tourist season  it is not clear if it will continue this activity in the future 
the company s strategy envisions modernizing helicopter services fleet eventually reducing the number of different models operated and replacing older units with new equipment 
we will also be looking to grow through acquisitions and joint ventures 
in  the company began expanding inland river services business 
approximately of the existing dry cargo barge fleet and of the liquid cargo tank barge fleet operating on the us inland waterways are over years old 
the company s fleet is one of the most modern in the industry 
in fact  we believe that there have been more retirements of old equipment than deliveries of new equipment in the last few years greater retirements for dry cargo barges and greater for liquid barges over the last five years 
as there have not been a large number of new dry cargo barges delivered in the last twelve months the company believes that improvements observed in the second half of will carry forward into increasing investment in the company s inland river services has served to diversify the company s portfolio of marine assets and to reduce its exposure to the offshore energy industry s cycles 
demand for our barges is dependent on different global economic forces and while that demand can fluctuate  the company believes that the inland barge business is one of the businesses that over time will provide an attractive opportunity for capital investment 
in addition to adding owned dry cargo and chemical tank barges since  the company has invested in six towboats 
inland river services transports dry bulk commodities by barge on the us inland waterways and it manages its own barges and those owned by others through a pooling arrangement allowing for greater efficiencies in competing for cargoes 
the tank barges are entered in a pooling arrangement managed by a third party and the towboats are bareboat chartered out and operated by a third party 
the company has also pursued diversification by continuing its expansion of environmental services 
in addition to oil spill response services  we have continued to grow in emergency response  planning and preparation  and remediation services both domestically and internationally 
we intend to continue the growth of this segment by competing for contracts internationally  pursuing selective acquisitions and developing additional business with existing clients 
critical accounting policies general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available and which have a significant impact on the results it reports 
some accounting policies require the company to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our more critical accounting estimates are included in the discussion that follows 
the company also has other policies that are considered key accounting policies  such as revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
reserves for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company s reserves for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customers receivable balances 
in establishing reserves  the company assesses customer credit quality as well as other factors and trends  including the age of receivable balances 
individual credit assessments are performed regularly 
once the company completes its assessment of receivable balances due from customers  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
a reserve is established when the company views loss is likely and the level of reserves can fluctuate depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
because amounts due the company from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to our reserve could be material if one or more customers receivables are considered uncollectible 
goodwill 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
as a result of recording various business combinations  the company s book carrying value of goodwill totaled million  or of total assets  at december  the company performs an annual review of goodwill and would more frequently if indictors of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
the company s impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its book carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process uses the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates  including the following for the reporting units revenue  based on assumed market segment growth rates and the company s assumed market segment share  estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business weighted average cost of capital 
these various estimates are reviewed annually and many are developed as part of our routine business planning and forecasting process 
the inputs and outcomes of the company s discounted cash flow analysis are compared to available and comparable market data 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  variations from those estimates could produce materially different results 
the company has completed its annual impairment test of goodwill based upon carrying values as of december  and has determined there was no goodwill impairment 
investments in business ventures 
the company holds less than majority investments in  and has receivables from  strategically aligned companies that totaled million at december  the company employs the equity method of accounting for investments in business ventures when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the venture 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the company has between and of the voting rights of an investee 
the company performs regular reviews of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and services and its present and projected results and cash flows 
when an investee has experienced consistent declines in financial performance or difficulties in raising capital to continue operations  the investment is written down to a new cost basis when the company expects the decline to be other than temporary 
actual results may vary from estimates due to the uncertainties regarding the projected financial performance of investees  the severity and expected duration of declines in value  and the available liquidity in the capital markets to support the continuing operations of the investees in which the company has investments  all of which affect the application of this investment valuation policy 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that the company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business segment or an asset grouping contained therein in relation to expectations and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping s carrying amount and its fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
the company s offshore support vessels and many of its helicopters service offshore oil and gas companies that operate in a cyclical industry 
the company is required to exercise considerable judgment in assessing this cyclicality at the same time other events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the carrying amount of assets many not be recoverable 
furthermore  were the company be required to perform a recoverability test  considerable judgment would be employed in projecting future cash flows and an variations in those assumptions could cause a change in the results of the test 
self insurance liabilities 
the company maintains business insurance programs with respect to its offshore support vessels that contain significant self insured retention 
in addition  the company maintains a self insured health benefit plan for its participating employees 
the company limits its exposure to the business insurance programs and health benefit plans by maintaining stop loss and aggregate liability coverage 
the company makes estimates to record expenses related to these programs based upon historical experience 
to the extent that estimated self insurance losses differ from actual losses realized  the company s insurance reserves could differ significantly and may result in either higher or lower insurance expense in future periods 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets totaling million resulting primarily from net operating loss carryforwards expiring in and and foreign tax credit carryforwards expiring from through the company believes that it will be able to utilize the remaining net operating loss carryforwards and net foreign tax credit carryforwards through the turnaround of existing temporary differences  future earnings  tax strategies or a combination thereof 
general offshore marine services our fleet services oil and gas exploration and production facilities mainly in the gulf of mexico  the north sea  latin america and mexico  west africa and asia 
the number and type of vessels we operate and their rates per day worked and utilization levels are the key determinants of offshore marine services operating results and cash flows 
the table below sets forth rates per day worked  utilization and available days data for our fleet during the periods indicated 
the rate per day worked for any vessel with respect to any period is the ratio of total time charter revenue of such vessel to the aggregate number of days worked by such vessel for such period 
utilization with respect to any vessel during a given period is the ratio of aggregate number of days worked by such vessel to total calendar days available for work during such period 
available days represent the total calendar days during which owned and chartered in vessels are operated by the company 
fleet rates per day worked anchor handling towing supply domestic    anchor handling towing supply foreign    crew domestic    crew foreign    geophysical  freight and other foreign  n a n a mini supply domestic    mini supply foreign    standby safety foreign    supply domestic    supply foreign    towing supply domestic    towing supply foreign    utility domestic n a   utilization anchor handling towing supply domestic anchor handling towing supply foreign crew domestic crew foreign geophysical  freight and other domestic geophysical  freight and other foreign n a n a mini supply domestic mini supply foreign standby safety foreign supply domestic supply foreign towing supply domestic towing supply foreign utility domestic n a overall fleet utilization available days anchor handling towing supply domestic    anchor handling towing supply foreign    crew domestic    crew foreign    geophysical  freight and other domestic geophysical  freight and other foreign n a n a mini supply domestic    mini supply foreign standby safety foreign    supply domestic    supply foreign    towing supply domestic   towing supply foreign    utility domestic n a   overall fleet available days    unless we decide to remove a vessel from operational service  there is little reduction in daily running costs such as crew cost  insurance and other support expenses 
as a result  direct vessel operating costs as a percentage of revenues may vary substantially due to changes in rates per day worked and utilization 
in some instances the cost of lay up would necessitate paying redundancy expenses thereby making it more economical to keep a vessel in service  even if current utilization and rates do not cover daily operating expenses 
the company does not believe  however  in keeping equipment in service simply to avoid the cost of redundancy and does so only when it expects that conditions will improve soon enough to make it impractical to release personnel and re hire them on a timely basis 
the aggregate cost of our operations primarily depends on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
offshore marine services operating expenses include daily running expenses  and other fixed costs 
daily running costs are primarily comprised of wages paid marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and insurance  which vary depending on equipment type  location and activity 
two significant components of maintenance and repair expenses are drydock and main engine overhaul costs 
vessel drydockings are regularly performed in accordance with applicable regulations as are main engine overhauls in accordance with manufacturers recommendations 
should we undertake a disproportionate number of drydockings and or main engine overhauls in a particular fiscal year  comparative operating expense results may be affected 
depreciation and charter in expenses are offshore marine services principal fixed costs 
depreciation depends on the acquisition costs of vessels and their related useful life assumptions 
when vessels are sold and leased back  bareboat chartered  depreciation and finance charges become indirectly assimilated into operating expenses via a lease payment 
a portion of our operating revenues and expenses  primarily related to our north sea operations are received and paid in pounds sterling 
for financial statement reporting purposes  these amounts are translated into us dollar equivalents at the weighted average exchange rates in effect during the applicable periods 
we believe our strong financial condition  diverse fleet and broad geographical distribution of vessels assist us in weathering the effects of industry downturns 
the company s financial position also enables us to capitalize on opportunities as they develop for purchasing  mobilizing  or upgrading vessels to meet changing market conditions and optimize the financial performance of the fleet 
environmental services environmental services provides emergency oil spill and hazardous material response and industrial remediation services 
our customers are tank and non tank vessel owner operators  refiners and terminal operators  exploration and production facility operators  pipeline operators  power generating operators  airports and industrial companies 
we assist our customers in complying with the requirements imposed on them by opa  various state and municipal regulations and international marine conventions 
we also offer consulting and planning services on a retainer and on an as needed basis 
operating results and cash flows are very dependent on the number of spill responses in a given fiscal period and the magnitude of each spill 
consequently  spill response revenues and related income and cash flows can vary materially between comparable periods and the revenues from any one period is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated results in future periods 
in  environmental services had extensive operations in iraq and in  responded to a major oil spill on the delaware river in the united states 
costs of oil spill response activities can include payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials and or the direct charge of labor  equipment and materials provided by environmental services 
profits earned on equipment intensive responses tend to be better than the profits earned on labor intensive responses 
the cost of equipment is largely fixed in relation to the capital investment whereas the cost of labor is variable 
further  labor costs can increase significantly when overtime payments are required as is typically the case with emergency responses that occur outside of normal business hours 
profit margins can also vary based on the use of our own personnel and equipment resources versus the use of third party personnel and equipment 
we charge a retainer fee for ensuring by contract the availability at predetermined rates of our response services and equipment 
retainer services include employing a staff to supervise response to an oil spill emergency and maintaining specialized equipment  including marine equipment  in a ready state for emergency and spill response as contemplated by response plans filed by its customers in accordance with opa and various state regulations 
environmental services maintains relationships with numerous environmental sub contractors to assist with response operations and equipment maintenance and provide trained personnel for deploying equipment in a spill response 
environmental services charges fees for its consulting and industrial and remediation services on both a time and material basis and on a fixed fee bid basis 
in both cases the total fees charged are dependent upon the scope of work to be accomplished and the labor and equipment to carry it out 
the margins on time and material services are more predictable and for the most part are larger 
as with emergency response work  the margins on equipment intensive jobs are higher than labor intensive jobs 
the principal components of environmental services operating expenses are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to subcontractors  equipment maintenance and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer  spill  consulting and other environmental business activities 
inland river services inland river services is primarily engaged in the operation of a fleet of dry cargo barges on the us inland waterways in the us and transports a range of dry bulk commodities  such as grain  coal  aggregate  ore  steel  scrap steel and fertilizers 
the company embarked several years ago on a construction program to upgrade and modernize inland river services fleet and intends to maintain a modern and productive fleet 
at the end of  the average age of the dry cargo barge fleet was less than years which the company believes is among the youngest fleets on the us inland waterways system 
we expect the younger fleet to enhance our customer service by improving availability and reliability due to reduced downtime for repairs 
we also expect our younger fleet to reduce the amount of replacement capital expenditures needed in future years to maintain our fleet size and thus our revenue generating capacity 
generally  we believe the primary barriers to effective competitive entry into the us inland waterways markets are the complexity of operations  consolidation of the towing industry and the difficulty in assembling a sufficiently large fleet to operate efficiently 
a large fleet and experienced personnel are required for an operator to be efficient in the execution of voyages and its ability to spread risk 
competitive factors among established operators primarily include the price and availability of barges 
in addition to reliability  barge operators must have equipment of a suitable type and in condition for a specific cargo 
we generally charge a price per ton from a specific point of origin to a specific destination for the transportation of dry bulk commodities 
customers are permitted a specified number of days to load and discharge the cargo  and thereafter pay a per diem rate for extra time 
from time to time  a small number of our dry cargo barges will be used for storage for a period prior to delivery 
as of december   of our dry cargo barges are chartered to  and operated by  other operators for various periods of time for a fixed rate per day 
we seek to maintain a balance in northbound and southbound cargo commitments in order to optimize fleet utilization 
we also seek to balance our book of business between spot market and long term commitments in order to provide a more stable cash flow while maintaining the opportunity to participate in the higher day rates primarily experienced during the fall grain harvest season 
if factors such as the access to discharge destinations are suitable  we believe that dry cargo barge transportation provides a cost advantage over alternative modes of inland transportation as it provides the lowest unit cost of delivery for high volume bulk products 
the majority of dry cargo barges owned and those leased in and certain others managed for third parties participate in pooling arrangements 
pursuant to these pooling arrangements  operating revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and the net results are allocated to participants based upon the number of days the barges participate in the pool 
in order to mitigate its exposure to market fluctuations in the cost of towing  fleeting  cleaning and switching services which are essential to inland river services operation  we have established several preferred vendor relationships for those services 
in  inland river services earned  and of its operating revenues from the participation in dry cargo barge pools that it managed  charter out of dry cargo barges and operation of inland towboats and other activities  respectively 
the following table presents  for the years indicated  inland river services interest in the tons hauled  percentage of tons moved and percentage of operating revenues derived from the movement of cargo and earned from its participation in dry cargo barge pools 
in thousands tons percent of tons percent of revenues tons percent of tons percent of revenues tons percent of tons percent of revenues grain  non grain   dry cargo barge operating expenses are typically differentiated between those directly related to voyages and all other dry cargo barge operating costs 
cargo voyage expenses primarily include towing  switching  fleeting and cleaning costs  non voyage related operating expenses include such costs as repairs  insurance and depreciation 
for barges chartered out  related expense is limited to depreciation 
we have also invested in twenty  barrel bbl chemical tank barges which are managed by and participate in a chemical tank barge pool with a third party experienced in that segment of the industry 
we expect to take delivery of another sixteen of such barges during the first half of we believe that the investment in  bbl chemical tank barges represents an opportunity to benefit from increasing demand for modern equipment as older equipment is retired 
helicopter services our helicopter services consist of the following distinct services  segregated by region or function gulf of mexico oil and gas  alaska oil and gas and utility  alaska flightseeing  firefighting  and leasing 
helicopter services fleet principally provides transportation services to the offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production industry that operates in the gulf of mexico 
the era acquisition on december  approximately tripled the size of helicopter services fleet to helicopters and expanded the scope of its operations in the gulf of mexico 
the era acquisition has also allowed helicopter services to enter transportation services in the oil and gas industry and the flight seeing tourist industry in alaska and the forestry support industry in the western united states 
helicopter services operating revenue depends on the demand for its transportation services and the pricing and terms of its contracts 
as with our offshore marine operations  drilling activity is a major factor influencing demand for our equipment 
we measure the demand for our helicopter services in flight hours 
in the gulf of mexico and alaska seasonal weather conditions impact revenue 
in the gulf of mexico most operations are conducted during daylight longer summer days afford the opportunity for more flight hours and revenues 
we are working to diversify flight services by leasing out surplus aircraft 
another key source of revenues is forest fire control services throughout the western united states and alaska tourism 
transportation services provided offshore oil and gas production customers represent a significant portion of our operations 
our offshore oil and gas industry customers exploration and development activities are influenced by actual and expected trends in commodity prices for oil and gas 
exploration and development activities generally use medium size and larger aircraft on which we typically earn higher margins 
production related activities are less sensitive to variances in commodity prices  and accordingly provide a more stable activity base for our flight operations 
we estimate that a majority of our current oil and gas operating revenue in helicopter services is related to production related activities activities of our customers 
drilling related activities affect the demand for our crew change services 
most of our flight services are provided under short term contractual arrangements or  an as needed basis  under master service agreements 
term contracts are only occasionally available  and then they are usually confined to flying for major oil and gas companies 
our oil and gas  forestry support and other contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we also perform ad hoc services where our charges can be based on an hourly rate 
maintenance and repair expenses  employee compensation  insurance costs and fuel expenses represent a significant portion of helicopter services overall operating expenses 
we expense maintenance and repair cost  including major aircraft component overhaul costs  as incurred 
third party vendors maintain certain major aircraft components  primarily engines and transmissions  under contractual arrangements 
the maintenance costs related to these contractual arrangements are recorded ratably as the components are used 
in addition to these variable operating expenses  we incur fixed charges for depreciation of its helicopters and other property and equipment 
for accounting purposes  we depreciate our helicopters on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives to an estimated residual value of of their original cost 
we generally estimate the life of a helicopter to be no more than years from the date of build 
increased offshore activity should increase demand for our helicopter services 
we believe that in order for us to participate effectively in an improving market  helicopter services fleet should be modernized 
our emphasis in our fleet renovation program has been and continues to be to invest in new technology equipment with enhanced safety features and greater performance characteristics than existing equipment 
we believe we have had opportunities to negotiate and place orders for modern equipment at attractive prices 
in measuring and evaluating our performance  we look at flight hours flown 
in we operated aircraft with an aggregate of  flight hours and in we operated aircraft with an aggregate of  flight hours 
these hours are only reflective of historical performance before the completion of the era acquisition and therefore are not indicative of management s expectations for future flight hours for the helicopter services increased fleet size 
other activities the company s equity investee  globe wireless  has experienced negative cash flow 
the company presently expects globe wireless can achieve operating cash break even without requiring additional equity funding from its shareholders 
there can be no assurances that globe wireless future operations will be successful 
should globe wireless be unable to meet its funding requirements  seacor would be required to commit additional funding or record an impairment charge with respect to its investment 
as of december   the company s carrying value of its equity investment in globe wireless was million 
results of operations the table below provides an analysis of the company s consolidated statements of income for each year indicated 
see item consolidated financial statements note major customers and segment data included in part iv for additional financial information about the company s business segments and geographical areas of operation 
the company commenced the separate reporting of its inland river services activities as a business segment in the first quarter of due to its increased significance from capital expansion and its helicopter services activities as a business segment in the fourth quarter of due to the expected increase in its significance following the acquisition of era on december  consolidated results percent change in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent operating revenues offshore marine services    environmental services    inland river services    helicopter services   other eliminations   operating income    other income expense  net    income before taxes  minority interest and equity earnings  income taxes    income before minority interest and equity earnings  minority interest equity earnings    net income    includes net gains on asset sales of  in   in and  in resulting principally from the sale of offshore support vessels

fleet dispositions were offset by the purchase of vessels and the charter in of vessels 
declines in utilization and rates per day worked for our larger overseas vessels and gulf of mexico mini supply vessels were partly offset by improved results from the operation of crew and standby safety vessels resulted in lowered operating revenues of approximately million 
operating revenues also declined million due primarily to a net increase in the number of vessels entering bareboat charter out service upon concluding time charter out arrangements 
these declines were partly offset by an increase in reported operating revenues of million that resulted from a strengthening between years in the pound sterling currency relative to the us dollar with respect to offshore marine services north sea operations 
reduced rates per day worked and utilization lowered operating revenues by million and million  respectively in vessel demand was particularly weak in the gulf of mexico due to depressed rig utilization 
net fleet dispositions decreased operating revenues by million 
during  utility vessels were retired from service following the company s decision to divest itself of this vessel type 
in addition  vessels including utility vessels that were previously classified as retired from service were sold and chartered in vessels were redelivered to owners upon charter termination 
fleet dispositions and those retired from service were offset by offshore marine services purchase of vessels and charter in of vessels 
vessel additions reflected the company s strategy to modernize its fleet 
operating revenues also declined million due principally to vessels entering bareboat charter out service that previously operated under time charter out arrangements 
these declines were partly offset by an increase in reported operating revenues of million that resulted from a strengthening between years in the pound sterling currency relative to the us dollar with respect to offshore marine services north sea operations 
operating income 
operating income was lower due to decreases in utilization and rates per day worked as described above 
profits declined with reduced asset sale gains 
vessel operating expenses increased between years due principally to i the provisioning for loss contingencies with respect to insurance contract deductibles  ii higher seamen redundancy costs associated with workforce reductions  iii increased vessel importation fees in certain west african countries and iv a rise in compensation paid foreign seamen 
these declines were partly offset by the replacement of underutilized older vessels with new  more profitable vessels 
declining fleet size resulted in administrative staff reductions and lower administrative costs 
the decline in operating income in resulted from those factors affecting operating revenues  described above  and increased operating and administrative expenses 
additional vessel sale and leaseback transactions increased charter in expenses 
reductions in the size of offshore marine services fleet resulted in redundancy payments to both seamen and staff personnel 
vessel insurance premiums increased  as did compensation paid foreign seamen 
even though there was an increase in reported operating revenue due to the strengthening in the pound sterling relative to the us dollar  currency exchange rate fluctuations had no material effect on operating results  because offshore marine services also pays its north sea expenses in pounds sterling

spill response activities approximated of environmental services operating revenues in operating income 
although environmental services operating income improved in  profits as a percent of sales declined from the prior year 
the delaware river spill response required significant sub contractor support that resulted in reduced profit margins 
operating income increased in due to those factors affecting operating revenues and a decline in depreciation expense 
profit margins earned on activities in iraq were higher than those customarily earned on most spill response projects because of the associated level of risk and difficulty of logistical support

the operating losses of globe wireless declined between years 
prior year results included an impairment charge relating to the company s investment in an entity that develops and sells software to the ship brokerage and shipping industry 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of working capital needs  acquisition  construction or improvement of equipment  repayment of debt obligations  repurchase of common stock and purchase of other investments 
principal sources of liquidity are cash balances  marketable securities  construction reserve funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility although  from time to time  the company may issue debt  shares of common stock  preferred stock  or a combination thereof  or sell vessels and other assets to finance the acquisition of equipment and businesses or make improvements to existing equipment 
fleet size  rates of hire and utilization of the company s offshore support vessels  inland barges and helicopters and the number and severity of oil spills managed by environmental services primarily determine the company s levels of operating cash flows 
summary of cash flows in thousands cash provided by or used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  net cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  operating activities weak demand for vessels resulting from depressed drilling activities during the first half of and declines in the size of offshore marine services fleet lowered the company s cash flows provided by operating activities in and declines were partly offset by improved operating cash flows of inland river services and environmental services 
the size of the company s barge fleet increased significantly in and and major oil spill response activities occurred in those same years 
helicopter services  which commenced operations january   approximated cash flow breakeven in and incurred a modest cash flow loss in investing activities the company s capital expenditure activities in recent years reflect its strategy to diversify its asset base by allocating capital into assets of differing industries 
in recent years  the company has sold vessels to reduce its overall exposure to older assets in offshore marine services and has acquired other vessels to adjust the mix of its fleet 
the company has also significantly expanded its investment in inland barging assets in recent years and is committed to acquiring newer  more capable helicopter equipment for servicing the offshore oil and gas industry

subsequent to december   the company sold offshore support vessels for aggregate consideration of million 
an additional vessel is expected to be sold on or about march  for many years  the company has maintained construction reserve funds with the us maritime administration that were established pursuant to section of the merchant marine act   as amended 
in accordance with this statute  the company has been permitted to deposit vessel sale proceeds into construction reserve fund accounts for purposes of acquiring new us flag vessels and thereby qualifying for temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from sale of vessels 
the company and the us maritime administration control these accounts jointly 
from date of deposit  withdrawals from the jointly controlled construction reserve fund accounts are subject to prior written approval of the us maritime administration  and the funds on deposit must be committed for expenditure within three years or be released for the company s general use 
in prior years  the company has used these funds to acquire vessels and  in  has also used some of the funds to acquire barges 
any such gains from vessel sales previously deferred would become immediately taxable upon release to the company of sale proceeds that were deposited into jointly controlled construction reserve fund accounts 
the company set aside cash in construction reserve fund accounts during both and at december  the company held million in construction reserve funds 
cash used in investing activities for corporate acquisition transactions increased million in and million in the company acquired era in and foss environmental services company in investing activities with offshore marine services joint ventures provided cash flows of million in and million in resulting from the repayment of loans and distribution of dividends to the company

the company is required to make minimal monthly lease payments until june  when it is obligated to purchase vessel at a fixed price 
the company has million available for use under a five year  non reducing  unsecured revolving credit facility that terminates in february advances under this revolving credit facility are available for general corporate purposes 
interest on advances will be charged at a rate per annum of libor plus an applicable margin of to basis points based upon the company s credit rating as determined by standard and poor s and moody s 
adjustments to the applicable margin are the only consequence of a change in the company s credit rating 
the company is not required to maintain a credit rating under the terms of the facility agreement  and if the company does not maintain a credit rating  the applicable margin would be determined by financial ratios 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants covering interest coverage  secured debt to total capitalization  funded debt to total capitalization ratios  the maintenance of a minimum level of consolidated net worth  as well as other customary covenants  representations and warranties  funding conditions and events of default

the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt 
short and long term liquidity requirements the company anticipates it will generate positive cash flows from operations in the coming year and these cash flows will be adequate to meet the company s working capital requirements and contribute toward defraying the costs of next year s capital expenditures 
as in the past and in further support of the company s capital expenditure program  the company may use cash balances  sell marketable securities  utilize construction reserve funds  sell additional vessels or other equipment  enter into sale and leaseback transactions for equipment  borrow under its revolving bank credit facility  issue debt or a combination thereof 
the company s long term liquidity is dependent upon its ability to generate operating profits sufficient to meet its requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and a reasonable return on shareholders investment 
the company believes that earning such operating profits will permit it to maintain its access to favorably priced debt  equity and or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
with the cyclical nature of the energy business and the recent adverse effect it has had on the company s results of operations and cash flows  the company has adopted a strategy of reducing its overall dependency on this industry and reinvesting certain of its capital resources in inland river services 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company guaranteed up to million with respect to amounts owing pursuant to a vessel charter agreement between the company s mexican joint venture and the owner of the chartered vessels

in the case of gurantees relating to the charter arrangements and loan agreement  obligations thereunder decline over time 
the guarantees terminate at various dates through effects of inflation the company s operations expose it to the effects of inflation 
although the company does not consider the effects of inflation to be material to its operating revenues or income from continuing operations  in the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy  inflationary pressures could result in increased operating and financing costs 
related party transactions the company manages barge pools as part of its inland river services segment 
pursuant to the pooling agreements  operating revenues and expenses of participating barges in a pool are combined and the net results are allocated to participating barge owners based upon the number of days any one participating owner s barges bear to the total number of days of all barges participating in a pool 
mr 
fabrikant  the chief executive officer of seacor  companies controlled by mr 
fabrikant and trusts for the benefit of mr 
fabrikant s two children own barges that participated in the barge pools managed by the company prior to the company s acquisition of scf and since then  they have continued to participate in that barge pool

fabrikant and his affiliates million and million  respectively  for undistributed net barge pool results 
mr 
fabrikant and his affiliates participate in the barge pool on the same terms and conditions as other pool participants who are unrelated to the company 
during the second quarter of pursuant to a provision agreed in connection with the company s acquisition of stirling shipping holdings limited in may  the company entered into a revenue sharing pooling agreement with harrisons offshore limited harrisons  a scottish company in which mr 
james cowderoy  a director of seacor  is a shareholder and managing director 
under the pooling agreement  the revenue from two supply vessels owned by the company and two supply vessels owned by harrisons operating in the north sea was shared pursuant to an agreed allocation formula and seacor was paid a fee for commercially managing the pool 
during  harrisons earned approximately million of additional revenues under the pooling agreement and the company earned approximately million of management fees 
as of december   there was million of unpaid pooling allocations due to harrisons from the company under the terms of the pooling agreement 
there was no activity under the pooling agreement in and the pooling agreement was terminated in february contingencies in connection with an examination of the company s income tax returns for fiscal years and  the internal revenue service irs previously indicated that it was considering whether to propose a change in the manner in which vessel assets are classified for purposes of depreciation and asserted deficiencies with respect to the deduction of certain other expenses 
settlements have been reached with the irs on all outstanding issues resulting in no material impact to the company s financial position or results of operations

cautionary statements certain statements discussed item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and elsewhere in this form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results  performance or achievements of results to differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and other important factors include  among others offshore marine services and helicopter services are subject to cyclicality and a significant or prolonged decline in oil and gas prices would likely reduce the level of exploration and development of offshore areas and would reduce demand for the company s vessels and helicopters 
the offshore oil and gas industry is highly cyclical 
activity in the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry has a significant impact on offshore marine services and helicopter services 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile and  as a result  the level of offshore exploration and drilling activity has also been extremely volatile 
reductions in oil and gas prices generally result in decreased drilling and production and corresponding decreases in demand for the company s vessels  logistics services and helicopters 
historically  offshore marine services customers capital spending has tracked with increases and decreases in oil and gas commodity prices  after giving effect to inventory levels and consumer demand 
a decline in rig demand that began in early tracked oil and natural gas commodity prices until the second half of  when prices reached and remained at historical high levels into but did not produce an increase in drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and north sea  two of offshore marine services operating regions 
high commodity prices continued throughout and offshore marine services  as well as helicopter services  experienced a modest increase in demand in the second half of the year for marine and helicopter support services in the gulf of mexico and marine services in the north sea services 
offshore marine services faces intense competition that could adversely affect its ability to increase its market share and revenues 
offshore marine services operates in a highly competitive environment 
high levels of competition could reduce its operating revenues  increase expenses and reduce its profitability 
in addition to price  service and reputation  important competitive factors for offshore fleets of vessels include customer flag preferences  local marine operating conditions and intended use of vessels 
other principal competitive factors include the ability to maintain logistical support given the complexity of a project and presence of equipment in the appropriate geographical locations 
helicopter services faces intense competition that could adversely affect its ability to increase its market share and revenues 
helicopter services operates in a highly competitive environment 
high levels of competition could reduce its operating revenues  increase expenses and reduce its profitability 
in addition to price  service and reputation  important competitive factors for helicopter services include local operating conditions  safety record  reliability and availability of helicopters for specific requirements 
in addition  many of helicopter services customers operate their own helicopters which can limit rates 
unstable political  military and economic conditions in foreign countries where a significant proportion of offshore marine services operations are conducted could adversely impact the company s business 
during  approximately of the company s revenues principally resulted from offshore marine services foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  among other things  of political instability  potential vessel seizure  terrorist attacks  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo  for example  could have a significant negative impact on activity in the oil and gas industry and correspondingly on the company should it operate vessels in the region of the embargo 
in addition  the company s vessel operations in mexico are significantly affected by mexican government policy 
the company cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future 
offshore marine services and helicopter services rely on several customers for a significant share of its revenues  the loss of which could adversely affect offshore marine services and helicopter services businesses and operating results 
offshore marine services and helicopter services customers are primarily major oil companies  large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the portion of offshore marine services or helicopter services revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by such customer  offshore marine or helicopter services ability to meet its customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond offshore marine or helicopter services control 
the company may be unable to maintain or replace its vessels as they age 
as of december   the average age of offshore support vessels the company owned  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
an increase in the supply of offshore support vessels would likely have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by the company s offshore support vessels 
expansion of the worldwide offshore support vessel fleet would increase competition in the markets where offshore marine services operates 
the refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil and gas exploration and production support and related activities or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity would lower charter rates 
if the company does not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of its common stock  the company could be prohibited from operating its offshore support vessels in parts of the us and could be prohibited from operating its helicopters  which would adversely impact its business and operating results 
the company is subject to the shipping acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of offshore support vessels used to carry cargo between us ports 
the acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the us the company is also subject to regulations pursuant to the federal aviation act of  as amended  and other statutes aviation acts 
generally  our aircraft operating in the us must be registered in the us in order to register such aircraft under the aviation acts  the company must be owned or controlled by us citizens 
although the company s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the shipping acts  the company would be prohibited from operating its offshore support vessels in the us coastwise trade and its helicopters in the us during any period in which the company did not comply with these regulations 
failure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on our ability to retain offshore marine services and helicopter services customers 
offshore marine services and helicopter services customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider 
offshore marine services and helicopter services must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to our customers 
should this not be achieved  the ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected 
ocsla provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and gas 
because offshore marine operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production  the government s exercise of ocsla authority to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
vessel and helicopter related risks could disrupt offshore marine services and helicopter services operations and expose the company to liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels and helicopters is subject to various risks  including catastrophic disaster  adverse weather  mechanical failure and collision  and risks with respect to vessels additionally include sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of the company s personnel  equipment  cargo and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  the company could be held liable for resulting damages 
in addition  the affected vessels or helicopters could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenues 
helicopter services may be subject to adverse weather conditions and seasonality 
weather related and seasonal occurrences impact helicopter services poor weather conditions generally  tropical storm season in the gulf of mexico and other seasonal conditions in alaska and the western us  as well as the number of hours of daylight 
poor visibility  high winds  and heavy precipitation can affect the operation of helicopters and result in reduced number of flight hours 
in the gulf of mexico and alaska  winter months have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year and june through november is tropical storm season in the gulf of mexico 
during tropical storms  helicopter services is unable to operate in the area of the storm although flight activity may increase due to the evacuation of offshore workers 
in addition  many of helicopter services facilities are located along the us gulf of mexico coast and tropical storms may cause damage to its property 
the fall and winter months have fewer hours of daylight 
consequently  flight hours are generally lower at these times 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from helicopter services is dependent on actual flight hours and prolonged periods of adverse weather and the effect of fewer hours of daylight can adversely impact helicopter services 
spill response revenue is subject to significant volatility 
environmental services spill response revenues can vary greatly between comparable years based on the number and magnitude of spill responses in any given year which may vary widely 
as a result  environmental services profitability may also vary greatly from year to year 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for environmental services services 
environmental services is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa  international conventions and  to a lesser extent  upon local regulations 
less stringent oil spill regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for environmental services services 
there can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for environmental services oil spill response services could be reduced 
a change in  or revocation of  nrc s classification as an oil spill removal organization would result in a loss of business 
nrc is classified by the coast guard as an osro 
the coast guard classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills 
coast guard classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers because customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the coast guard 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements for classification could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  environmental services could lose customers 
environmental services could incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although environmental services is generally exempt from liability under the federal clean water act for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption would not apply if it was found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it fails to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the clean water act 
in addition  the exemption under the federal clean water act would not protect environmental services against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws 
while most of the us states in which environmental services provides service have adopted similar exemptions  several states have not 
if a court or other applicable authority determines that environmental services does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing spill response services  environmental services could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages  including damages caused by others 
inland river services could experience variation in freight rates 
freight transportation rates may fluctuate from year to year as the amount of cargo transported on the inland waterways may vary as a result of various factors  such as global economic conditions and business cycles  domestic and international agricultural production and demand and foreign currency exchange rates 
barge participation in the industry will also vary year to year and is dependent on the number of barges built and retired from service 
extended periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations can be adversely by the decline in us grain exports 
inland river services business is significantly affected by the level of grain export volume handled through gulf of mexico ports 
grain exports can vary due to  among other things  crop harvest yield levels in the us and abroad 
the shortage of available grain overseas can increase demand for us grain 
conversely  an abundance of grain overseas can decrease demand for us grain 
a decline in exports could result in excess barge capacity  which would likely lower freight rates earned by inland river services 
inland river services results of operations can be adversely affected by international economic and political factors 
the actions of foreign governments could affect the import and export of the dry bulk commodities typically transported by inland river services 
foreign trade agreements and each country s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for us imports and exports of the dry bulk commodities inland river services transports 
national and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or us imports and or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates will affect the demand for transportation of the cargoes inland river services transports 
these actions or developments could have an adverse impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations are affected by seasonal activity 
inland river services business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits have historically been lower during the first and second quarters of the year january through june and higher during the third and fourth quarters july through december during the grain harvest 
inland river services results of operations are affected by adverse weather and river conditions 
weather patterns can affect river levels and cause ice conditions that can hamper barge navigation during the winter months 
locks on river systems may be closed for maintenance or other causes  which may delay barge movements 
these conditions could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services faces intense competition and there are few barriers to entry 
there can be no assurance that competition will not adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fuel price fluctuations 
for the most part  inland river services purchases towboat and fleeting services from third party vendors 
it is indirectly exposed to increases in fuel prices  as vendors will adjust the price of the services when fuel prices escalate 
if this happens  inland river services results of operation may be adversely affected 
the company may incur significant costs  liabilities and penalties in complying with government regulations 
government regulation  such as international conventions  federal  state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where the company operates  have a significant impact on the company s business 
these regulations relate to worker health and safety  the manning  construction and operation of vessels  oil spills and other aspects of the company s business 
risks of incurring substantial compliance costs and liabilities and penalties for non compliance  particularly with respect to environmental laws and regulations  are inherent in the company s business 
the company cannot predict whether it will incur such costs or penalties in the future 
the company s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect the company from the liabilities that could arise in its businesses 
the company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its businesses 
there can be no assurance  however  that its existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  the company could be exposed to substantial liability 
the company s global operations are subject to currency exchange risks 
in some of its foreign businesses  the company collects revenues and pays expenses in local currency 
if the value of foreign currencies in particular the value of the pound sterling  the currency in the united kingdom  where most of the company s currency exchange risk arises decline against the us dollar and the company does not or is not able to minimize the effects of such fluctuations through currency hedging arrangements  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur losses in the future as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on the company 
the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel across all of the company s business segments is an important factor in its future success 
the market for the personnel we employee is very competitive 
the company cannot be certain that it will be successful in this process in the future 
item a
