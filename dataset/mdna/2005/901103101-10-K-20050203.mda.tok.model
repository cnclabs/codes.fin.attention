overview our business we design  develop  and sell digital video processing systems that enable telephony based service providers to deliver broadcast quality digital video signals across their networks 
we refer to these systems as digital tv headends or video content processing systems 
we also offer digital video processing systems that enable private enterprise and government entities to transport video signals across satellite  fiber  radio  or copper facilities for surveillance  distance learning  and tv production applications 
we also offer broadband transport and service management products that enable the provisioning of high speed internet access and other broadband data services over existing copper networks within hotels and private campus facilities 
our history prior to november  most of our sales were derived from our broadband transport and service management products 
in and  we acquired three companies freegate corporation  xstreamis limited and activetelco  inc and the assets from two other companies oneworld systems  inc and viagate technologies  inc 
in order to expand our sales of broadband transport and service management products 
however  the significant downturn in the world economy in general  and the telecommunications market in particular  beginning in late had a severe and sustained adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our sales of broadband transport and service management products decreased substantially beginning in  which required us to take a number of restructuring efforts and incur significant impairment and other charges in order to realign our cost structure in light of the economic environment 
for the period january  through december   we incurred an aggregate of million in intangible asset impairment charges and million in restructuring charges 
in  sales from our broadband transport and service management products stabilized  as we began to experience an improvement in sales of broadband transport and service management products to the hospitality industry 
with our november acquisition of tektronix s subsidiary vtc  we extended our product offerings to add video processing systems for digital tv headends and for the transmission of video signals over private and government networks 
the acquisition of vtc resulted in significant changes in our business  including changes in our organizational structure and employee staffing  relocation of our administrative offices  executive offices as of january and a significant portion of our operations from pleasanton  california to lake oswego  oregon  the prior headquarters of vtc  an expansion of our sales and marketing efforts to include vtc products  and a reprioritization of our research and development efforts to focus on products associated with vtc product lines 
with our acquisition of vtc  sales of video processing systems now represent a majority of our total revenues and will provide most of our growth opportunities in the foreseeable future 
we earn revenue primarily by selling video content processing systems both directly and through resellers to telecommunications service providers 
we also earn revenue by selling video transmission systems to tv broadcasters  government agencies and educational institutions  and by selling broadband transport and service management products directly and through distributors to the hospitality industry and to owners of private multi tenant campus facilities 
although international sales are still a material portion of our total sales  since our acquisition of vtc  international sales have represented a smaller percentage of our overall business relative to prior years 
during the years ended december   and  international sales represented  and of our total sales 
material trends and uncertainties we pay close attention to and monitor various trends and uncertainties about our business 
there is a growing demand by independent operating telephone companies to offer video services to their customer base 
according to a report released by instat mdr in april  the number of telco video subscribers worldwide will increase from  at the end of to over million by the end of while this growing market presents opportunities to serve a larger customer base  we are also seeing the emergence of intense competition as more companies compete to sell digital tv headend products 
we expect this market space will continue to become more competitive in the future 
as we begin to target larger telco customers  we expect to compete with larger public companies  including harmonic  motorola and tandberg television 
our immediate competitors in the digital tv headend markets are primarily small private companies that are focused on a more narrow product line than ours and thereby may be able to devote substantially more targeted resources to developing  marketing and selling new products than we are able to 
in addition  these companies may become targets for acquisition by larger companies  in which case we would face competitors with substantially greater name recognition  and technical  financial and marketing resources than we have 
this increased competitive pressure may adversely affect the amount and timing of our revenue in future periods  thereby making it more difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue  and may also adversely affect our product and service margins 
the emergence of new technologies to serve the digital tv headend market means that we must continue to invest in these new technologies to maintain our market position 
digital subscriber line  or dsl  technologies use sophisticated signal blending techniques to transmit data through copper wires 
the limitations on the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time such limitations are referred to as bandwidth and the distance data may be transmitted using copper wire constrain both the number of video channels that may be delivered simultaneously and the number of customers that are reachable from a telco central office over a dsl network 
emerging advancements in video compression technology will soon enable high quality video streams to be transported at lower data transfer rates than currently deployed 
these emerging compression advancements also introduce the possibility of delivering high definition television over bandwidth constrained asymmetric dsl  or adsl  lines for the first time 
adsl is a new technology that allows more data to be transmitted over existing copper telephone lines compared with standard dsl 
additionally  dsl advancements are emerging that expand the available bandwidth from the telco to the subscriber thereby supporting higher dsl data transfer rates over longer distances 
as our products continue to incorporate these new technological advancements  we expect the demand for our products will increase because our products will enable more telcos to reach more of their customers with a greater number of video channels 
however  because of the increasing competition in the markets in which we compete  regardless of our revenue and product and service margins in future periods  we will have to continue to devote significant resources to research and development in future periods in order to continue to offer our customers competitive products that incorporate these emerging technologies 
as a consequence  we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in compared to our spending in as we continue to capitalize on the growing number of telcos deploying video services in the united states and abroad  we will also have to continue to aggressively market our new and existing products and expand our marketing and sales efforts domestically and internationally 
nevertheless  our operations have been and will continue to be subject to pressure from weakness in the overall technology sector as well as the digital media industry  the continued lengthening of our sales cycle and delays of customer purchasing decisions  which may continue to reduce our expected revenue 
we believe that the lengthening of the purchase decision by prospective customers has occurred and may continue because of several factors that are affecting the overall digital tv headend market 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the delays in the introduction of advanced compression technologies and set top boxes early next year  the transition to more efficient data transmission technologies and the emergence of video signal encryption requirements 
nevertheless  given the opportunities offered by the growing number of telcos deploying video services and despite the length of the sales cycle  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in compared to our spending in internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures evaluation of fiscal year our chief executive officer and chief financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule a e under the exchange act as of december  this evaluation included various steps that our chief executive officer and chief financial officer undertook in an effort to ensure that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our sec reports was recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec and accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure 
this evaluation also included consideration of our internal controls and procedures for the preparation of our financial statements 
in january in connection with the completion of its audit of our financial statements for the year ended december   pricewaterhousecoopers llp  the company s independent auditors  advised management and the audit committee of the board of directors that it had identified deficiencies in our internal controls and processes relating to inventory management and reporting that it considered to be material weaknesses  as defined by statement on auditing standards no 
 communication of internal control related matters noted in an audit 
the material weaknesses that pricewaterhousecoopers identified related to inventory controls and the accounts payable process for the company s videotele 
com business  which the company acquired in november specifically our internal controls were inadequate to properly record our inventory quantities in an accurate and timely manner  and our accounts payable process failed to adequately reconcile our accounts payable records with suppliers records  considering what the suppliers had shipped to us prior to period end 
while these material weaknesses had an immaterial effect on our reported results  they nevertheless constituted deficiencies in our disclosure controls 
in light of these material weaknesses and the requirements enacted by the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations adopted by the sec  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that  as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures needed improvement and were not effective 
despite those deficiencies in our disclosure controls  management believed that there were no material inaccuracies  or omissions of material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made  in the form k for our fiscal year ended december  at the time of our acquisition of the videotele 
com business in november  we had in place disclosure controls and procedures and processes for our existing business ie  our pre november business that our ceo and cfo at the time believed to be sufficient to record  process  summarize and report information required to be reported within the time periods specified by the sec 
likewise  we had in place internal controls that our ceo and cfo believed at the time of the vtc acquisition to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
since december   we continued to review our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls periodically in connection with our form q filings 
throughout  our ceo and cfo continued to believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls allowed us to provide all material and necessary disclosure in a timely manner  as required by exchange act and the applicable rules thereunder 
in january  during the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december   pricewaterhousecoopers discovered the material weaknesses noted above and brought these weaknesses to our attention 
based on discussions with pricewaterhousecoopers and the audit committee of our board of directors  we worked throughout our year end accounting close and audit to identify the nature  scope and materiality of these weaknesses in our internal controls and their impact on our fiscal year financial statements and to determine the extent to which these internal control weaknesses might adversely affect our disclosure controls and procedures 
based on further detailed review of our internal controls as they relate to inventory and accounts payable during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the accounts payable process had failed to record certain liabilities associated with vtc products that we purchased  principally from our contract manufacturer and certain other suppliers 
we quantified this internal control weakness relating to accounts payable recordation by reconciling our records to that of our contract manufacturer and reviewing our liabilities with other vendors 
we quantified the inventory process control weakness by taking complete physical inventories at each vtc inventory location and reconciling the results to our records 
upon completion of our analysis and testing  we identified an additional charge of approximately  to cost of goods sold related to the internal control weaknesses identified above 
we recorded this charge prior to issuing our financial statements for the year ended december  in addition to our review of the financial statements for the year ended december   we re confirmed that our accounts payable recordation and inventory controls were effective for the year ended december  during our review of these internal controls weaknesses  we identified the cause of these internal control weaknesses to be the result of prior vtc accounting staff turnover that occurred during the first quarter of during this quarter  key accounting staff of vtc left the company without sufficient time to transition all of the internal controls and institutional knowledge to our remaining finance and accounting staff 
in addition to identifying the above two internal control weaknesses relating to inventory and the accounts payable process  we also tested our other internal controls to determine whether there were other such material weaknesses aside from the inventory and accounts payable weaknesses mentioned above that affected our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  in particular  we tested our other internal controls by reviewing processes  analytical reviews and substantive testing that included other third party confirmations and by reviewing activity subsequent to year end based on these tests  we did not identify any other material weaknesses in internal controls 
therefore  our ceo and cfo believed at the time of the original filing of the form k for our fiscal year ended december  on february  that they had reasonable grounds to conclude that the weaknesses in internal controls related solely to those items mentioned above and resulted in an immaterial charge of approximately  based on their review of our internal controls as described above  our ceo and cfo also assessed our disclosure controls and procedures for the fiscal year ended december  our ceo and cfo believed at the time of the original filing of the form k for our fiscal year ended december  that they had reasonable grounds to conclude that  other than the inventory and accounts payable weaknesses that pricewaterhousecoopers had identified  there were no other material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and that the information required to be reported in the form k was recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the applicable exchange act rules 
in order to ensure that we have eliminated the two weaknesses in our internal controls for purposes of future reporting  we have taken significant efforts to improve our processes and procedures as they relate to inventory reporting and accounts payable reconciliation 
the audit committee has taken an active role in these efforts  including overseeing management s implementation of corrective measures 
with respect to inventory management  we perform physical inventory counts at least at the end of each quarter 
we have implemented improved inventory systems and accounting controls and have hired an additional full time staff accountant to account for and control our inventory accounting  given our operations manager company wide responsibility for inventory management  have expanded our inventory receiving process to include remote locations  as appropriate  and now reconcile inventory to each customer order and have reiterated to key operations and accounting personnel the importance of proper inventory management and control 
regarding accounts payable reconciliation  we now confirm our key accounts payable balances with our vendors and reconcile the confirmations to our accounting records on a quarterly basis 
evaluation of fiscal year our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures  as of december  based on this evaluation  they concluded as of december  that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 
definitions for discussion of results of operations our discussion of our results of operations focuses on the following items from our income statement total revenues consists of product sales  and license and royalty fees 
product revenue consists of sales of our video processing systems  which includes both digital tv headend and video transmission systems 
product revenue also consists of revenue from our broadband transport and service management products 
license and royalty fees consist of non refundable license fees and royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
since our acquisition of vtc  a large part of our revenue has been associated with the sale of digital tv headends 
furthermore  each individual headend sale has represented a significant portion of our revenue 
if we were to sell even one less system than our forecasted number of headend sales  our revenue would be materially impacted 
as we did not enter into any new license or royalty agreements during  or  we expect minimal future license and royalty revenue 
cost of goods sold  or cogs  consists of costs related to raw materials  contract manufacturing  personnel  overhead  test and quality assurance for products  and the cost of licensed technology included in our products 
raw materials  contract manufacturing and licensed technology are the principal elements of cogs and vary directly with product sales 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of selling and marketing personnel costs  including sales commissions  travel  trade shows  promotions and outside services 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and facilities costs  contract consultants  outside testing services  and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for administrative officers and support personnel  professional services and insurance expenses 
amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of expenses associated with the amortization of technology and patents related to prior years acquisitions 
results of operations years ended december   and our acquisition of vtc has had a significant impact on every aspect of our financial statements since november this impact is reflected in the following discussion of our operating results 
this should be considered when evaluating our period to period comparisons of and relative to years prior to the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit loss operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring costs in process research and development impairment of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations impairment of certain equity investments gain on sale of investments interest and other income expense  net net loss total revenues 
for the year ended december   our total revenue decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  we operate in a single business segment across two related markets 
we measure our product revenue by our two product lines only and therefore are unable to further quantify the impact of individual products on our revenue 
during this same period  our product revenue from video processing systems decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  during  we experienced a slowing demand for our video processing systems from independent operating telephone companies compared to we believe the decrease in video processing systems product revenue was primarily due to the adverse effect of several digital tv headend sales not closing during the period as expected 
we continue to experience a variety of factors that are causing prospective customers to delay their purchase decisions 
certain prospective customers have indicated to us that factors causing these delays include  but are not limited to  their anticipation of the introduction and general availability of advanced compression technologies later in  customers decisions to use more efficient data transmission technologies decisions that some of our customers wish to make before they commit to purchasing headends and customers decisions about using emerging video signal encryption technologies decisions that some of our customers wish to make before they commit to purchasing headends 
we expect sales of video processing systems to remain unchanged until the expected introduction during the first half of of new products containing advanced compression technologies  including mpeg product revenue from the sale of our broadband transport and service management products decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in broadband transport and service management products revenue was primarily the result of customers choosing competing products that transmit data via wireless data transmission technologies instead of our products which transmit data over telephone wires 
accordingly  we expect sales of broadband transport and service management products to remain unchanged until the expected new product introductions during the first half of for the year ended december   our license and royalty revenue decreased by to  from million for the year ended december  as we did not enter into any new license or royalty agreements during  or  we expect minimal future license and royalty revenue 
for the year ended december   our product revenue increased by to million from million for the year ended december  this million increase in product revenue was due solely to the sale of our video processing systems 
fiscal year was the first full year that included revenue from products associated with our vtc acquisition in november for the year ended december   our license and royalty revenue decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   our cost of goods sold increased by  or million  to million from million for the year ended december  included in cost of goods are the effects of changes in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
these reserves were primarily related to lower of cost or market adjustments for raw materials and reserves for finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future 
during  cost of goods sold included a charge for an increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million 
this charge was primarily associated with our video processing systems products 
in  cost of goods sold was reduced as a result of a decrease in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million 
the decrease in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories in was because we were able to sell certain products for which we had originally set aside reserves in prior years 
in addition to this million increase included in costs of goods from the change in reserves for excess and obsolete inventories from to  other significant increases in cost of goods sold included increases in labor expenses of million  outside contractor expenses of million and freight costs of million 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in material cost of million 
our gross profit declined in compared to due to decreased sales volume for both our video processing systems and our broadband transport and service management products 
the cost increases previously mentioned  including the increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories also negatively affected our gross profit in when compared to for the year ended december   our cost of goods sold increased by to million from million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold increased by million between and  primarily due to costs associated with increased product sales  particularly from sales related to video processing systems of million  partially offset by the effects of changes in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million and decreases in costs associated with sales of our broadband transport and service management products of million 
in  we reduced our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories by million because we were able to sell certain products for which we had originally set aside reserves in prior years 
at the time these reserves were established  we expected a decline in sales due to the decline in the telecommunications market and general economic conditions at the time 
these changes in reserves are reflected in cost of goods sold 
our gross profit improved in compared to due to the increased sales volume relating to vtc products resulting in a gross margin increase of million  reduction in cost of goods sold for our broadband transport and service management products of million and the effect of changes in our reserves of million 
sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses increased by to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million in sales and marketing expense was due to a year over year increase in personnel related costs of million due to additional headcount added during the year  million for promotional and advertising costs  million for facilities and infrastructure expenses and million in outside services expenses 
for the year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in sales and marketing expense was due to a year over year decrease of million of personnel related costs  a million decrease in depreciation expense and a million decrease in facilities and infrastructure expenses 
research and development 
for the year ended december   our research and development expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our research and development expense was due to a year over year decrease in personnel related costs 
our capital expenditures for research and development were million in and million in for the year ended december   our research and development expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our research and development expense was primarily due to a year over year decrease of million in personnel related costs  a million decrease in project materials costs and a million decrease in facilities and infrastructure expenses 
we continued to reduce research and development expenses in to bring them into better alignment with our revenues at that time 
general and administrative 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our general and administrative expense was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs of million  lower insurance costs of million offset by higher relocation costs of million and outside service costs of million 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our general and administrative expense included decreases of million in personnel expenses  million in depreciation expense  million in professional services expenses  and million in insurance 
partially offsetting these year over year expense reductions was the benefit of a million bad debt recovery in that was not repeated in we recorded as an expense million relating to our pending settlement of certain litigation matters 
we also recorded an equal and offsetting gain to reflect the fact that  as of december   our insurance carriers had agreed to pay the settlement amounts for those litigation matters 
restructuring costs 
we incurred restructuring costs of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we did not incur any restructuring costs for the year ended december  in august  we implemented a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction and relocation 
this restructuring program resulted in restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of the restructuring costs consisted of million in workforce reduction charges related primarily to severance and fringe benefits and million in relocation expenses 
as a result of this restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
in august  we implemented a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction  closure of our new jersey research and development facility  and disposal of certain of our fixed assets 
as a result of this restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of these restructuring costs consisted of million in workforce reduction charges relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits and million relating to closure of the new jersey facility 
in november  we undertook further restructuring efforts that included an additional workforce reduction  the termination of our former headquarter s lease in pleasanton  california and the disposal of certain fixed assets 
as a result of these november efforts  we recorded restructuring costs of million  comprising severance and employee outplacement expenses of approximately million  million to terminate our pleasanton  california lease early  million for abandonment of leasehold improvements  million for abandonment of fixed assets and million to terminate various equipment leases 
in aggregate  we reduced our workforce by approximately in fiscal in process research and development 
during the years ended december  and we did not incur any expenses related to in process research and development 
amounts expensed as in process research and development were million in for the year ended december   our in process research and development expense of million was solely related to in process research and development purchased from vtc in november we expensed the purchased in process technology upon acquisition because technological feasibility of the technology had not been established and there were no future alternative uses for the technology 
we estimated the in process technology percentage of completion to be  and for the astria  m and software product lines  respectively 
we determined the value of this in process technology by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the net cash flows from the sale of the product after the completion of the in process technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a risk weighted discount rate of 
research and development costs to bring in process technology from vtc to technological feasibility were completed in impairment of intangible assets 
during the first quarter of  we determined that certain of the technology acquired as part of the purchase of the viagate technology assets had become impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the intangible assets associated with this technology 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of certain technology acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets of viagate 
there were no such impairments for the year ended december  amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is comprised of intangibles related to the acquisitions of vintel in  freegate  oneworld assets and xstreamis in  activetelco in  and vtc in the remaining intangible assets subject to amortization from these acquisitions consist primarily of completed technology and patents 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets decreased to million from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets increased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in when compared with was the result of an intangible asset becoming fully amortized in the million increase in when compared with was primarily the result of a full year of the additional amortization associated with the intangible assets arising from our vtc acquisition in november gain on sale of investments 
the gain on sale of investments for the year ended december   resulted from the sale of certain equity investments that had been written down to zero in a previous year 
impairment of certain equity investments 
impairment of certain equity investments consisted of the recognition of expense related to the write off of million invested in one privately held company during the year ended december  the value of our investment was impaired due to uncertainty associated with the on going viability of this business in the current network infrastructure industry 
there were no such impairments of our equity investments for the years ended december  and interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
for the year ended december   our interest and other income  net decreased to an expense of million from an income of  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to interest expense associated with the million note issued in connection with our purchase of vtc in november for the year ended december   our interest and other income  net decreased to  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in of million compared with was primarily the result of lower interest rates on lower average cash balances and increased interest expense associated with the note issued in connection with our purchase of vtc 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared with cash and cash equivalents of million at december   reflecting a net reduction in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the reduction in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a higher net loss in compared with  which was partially offset by lower accounts receivable balances  lower accounts payable balances and a higher provision for excess and obsolete inventory in  compared with the same period in additions to property and equipment were million and million in and  respectively 
in we expect capital expenditures to be comparable to we expect these capital expenditures to be funded from operations 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted of million from the issuance of million additional common shares in a secondary offering and million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december   resulted primarily from our use of million for operating activities and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents from these uses was offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan of million and million related to the acquisition of vtc 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
on september   we entered into a revolving asset based credit facility credit facility  with silicon valley bank the bank 
this facility has a term of two years and expires on september  borrowings under the credit facility are formula based and limited to the lesser of million or an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventories 
the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is equal to the bank s prime rate  as of december   plus 
the rate may increase by if we do not meet certain financial covenants 
the credit facility is secured by all of our assets  and contains various covenants 
based on the maximum percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory levels  borrowings available under this facility were million as of december  we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility at december  as part of our acquisition of vtc from tektronix in november  we issued a note payable to tektronix for million  with repayment in sixty months  or by november the interest rate on this note is and is compounded annually 
through january   the accrued interest is added to the principal balance of the note 
thereafter  we will pay accrued interest on this note commencing on january  and on each april  july and october thereafter until the principal balance is paid in full 
principal and accrued interest on the note payable is million at december  we have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  negative cash flows from operating activities of million  and have an accumulated deficit of million 
in order to provide additional financial resources  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with cosine communications  inc  or cosine on january  the proposed merger will be a stock for stock transaction valued at approximately million 
upon closing  we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock to the shareholders of cosine 
we expect the transaction to result in net cash to tut systems of approximately million  and is expected to close as soon as practicable following approval by the stockholders of both companies 
we are acquiring cosine primarily to provide additional liquidity 
we will honor cosine s existing customers support agreements  but do not expect to offer its products for sale to new customers 
we will not have any additional employees or facilities as a result of the transaction 
the transaction is conditioned upon approval of the merger by the holders of a majority of the shares of cosine common stock  and approval of the issuance of additional shares of common stock by the holders of a majority of the shares of tut systems common stock  as well as other customary closing conditions 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our credit facility as of december   are sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
in future periods  we generally anticipate that our working capital will begin to increase as a result of several factors  including our expectation that our revenue will increase and our net loss will decrease in as compared to accordingly  we expect the amount of cash used to fund our operations to decrease in however  in the event that we do not meet our revenue and earnings expectations  we may require additional cash to fund our operations 
failure to generate positive cash flow in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products  including third party products  through professional services  and through the sale of our software products 
we sell products through direct sales channels and through distributors 
generally  product revenue is generated from the sale of video processing systems and components and the sale of broadband transport and service management products 
turnkey solution revenue is principally generated by the sale of complete end to end video processing systems that are designed  developed and produced according to a buyer s specifications 
product revenue is generated primarily from the sale of complete end to end video processing systems generally referred to as turnkey solutions 
turnkey solutions are multi element arrangements  which consist of hardware products  software products  professional services and post contract support 
sales of turnkey solutions are classified as product revenue in the statement of operations 
product revenue is also generated from the sale of video processing component products and the sale of broadband transport and service management products 
we sell these products through our own direct sales channels and also through distributors 
our revenue recognition policies for turnkey solutions are in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  which is the authoritative guidance for recognizing revenue on software transactions and transactions in which software is more than incidental to the arrangement 
sop requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  such as hardware  software products  maintenance services  installation  training or other elements 
under sop  the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
if such evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop  as amended 
sop was amended in february by sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop and was amended again in december by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
those amendments deferred and then clarified  respectively  the specification of what was considered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various elements in a multiple element arrangement 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification or customization of software  which encompasses all of our turnkey arrangements  sop refers to the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue for all turnkey arrangements in accordance with sop and sop excluding the pcs element of the multi element arrangement  for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value as defined by sop  revenue from turnkey solutions is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method  as stipulated by sop the percentage of completion method reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned that is equal to the ratio of labor effort expended to date to the anticipated final labor effort  based on current estimates of total labor effort necessary to complete the project 
revenue from the pcs element of the arrangement is deferred at the point of sale and recognized over the term of the pcs period 
generally  the terms of the turnkey solution sales provide for billing of approximately of the contract value prior to the time of delivery to the customer site  with an additional approximately of the contract value billed upon substantial completion of the project and the balance upon customer acceptance 
the contractual arrangements relative to turnkey solutions include customer acceptance provisions 
however  such provisions are generally considered to be incidental to the arrangement in its entirety because customers are fully obligated with respect to approximately of the contract value irrespective of whether acceptance occurs or not 
for direct sales of video processing systems component products not included as part of turnkey solutions and the direct sale of broadband transport and service management products  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the measurement of revenue in a given period 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines for determining the timing of revenue recognition 
at the time of the transaction  we assess a number of factors  including specific contract and purchase order terms  completion and timing of delivery to the common carrier  past transaction history with the customer  the creditworthiness of the customer  evidence of sell through to the end user  and current payment terms 
based on the results of the assessment  we may recognize revenue when the products are shipped or defer recognition of revenue until evidence of sell through occurs and cash is received 
in order to recognize revenue  we must also make a judgment regarding collectibility 
management s judgment of collectibility is applied on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection and to new customers for which such history may not exist 
new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
new customers are typically assigned a credit limit based on a review of their financial position 
such credit limits are only increased after a successful collection history with the customer has been established 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  no credit is extended and revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
we also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs  as necessary 
estimated sales returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  as necessary 
our products generally carry a one year warranty from the date of purchase 
to date  warranty costs have been insignificant to the overall financial statements taken as a whole 
license and royalty revenue consists of nonrefundable up front license fees  some of which may offset initial royalty payments  and royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
currently  the majority of our license and royalty revenue is comprised of non refundable license fees paid in advance 
such revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which post contract customer support is expected to be provided or upon delivery and transfer of agreed upon technical specifications in contracts where essentially no further support obligations exist 
future license and royalty revenue is expected to consist primarily of royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
as we did not enter into any new license or royalty agreements during  or  we expect minimal future license and royalty revenue 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we record provisions to write down our inventory and related purchase commitments for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about the future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory provisions may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which amends fasb statement no 
and will be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the new standard will require us to expense employee stock options and other share based payments 
the fasb believes the use of a binomial lattice model for option valuation is capable of more fully reflecting certain characteristics of employee share options compared to the black scholes options pricing model 
the new standard may be adopted in one of three ways the modified prospective transition method  a variation of the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we are currently evaluating how we will adopt the standard and evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas shall be applied prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this statement was issued 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
additional risk factors that could affect our operating results and the market price of our stock we have a history of significant losses  and we may never achieve profitability 
we have incurred substantial net losses and experienced negative cash flow for each quarter since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses in the near future 
moreover  we may never achieve profitability and  if we do so  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
we may not be able to generate a sufficient level of revenue to offset our current level of expenditures 
moreover  because our expenditures for sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative functions are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to respond to any unanticipated decline in revenue 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the timeframe expected by securities analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
each sale of our digital headend systems represents a significant portion of our revenue for any given quarter 
our failure to meet our quarterly forecast of sales of digital headend systems in any given quarter could have a material adverse impact on our financial results for a given quarter 
since we acquired vtc in november  a large part of our quarterly revenue is associated with the sale of digital headend systems 
each sale represents a significant portion of our revenue for each quarter 
we base our operating forecast on our historical sales 
because of the high cost per unit of our digital headend systems  if we were to sell even one less system than our forecasted number of headend sales per quarter  such a decrease in sales would have a material and adverse impact on our revenue for that quarter  and we may fail to meet investor expectations 
we operate in an intensely competitive marketplace  and many of our competitors have better resources than we do 
our primary competitors in the digital tv headend market are small private companies that are focused on a more narrow product line than ours  thereby allowing these competitors to devote substantially more targeted resources to developing and marketing new products than we can 
as we target larger telco customers for our video content processing systems  we expect more competition from large public companies like harmonic  inc  tandberg television asa  and motorola  inc  all of which have substantially greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
these competitors have achieved success in providing headend components for cable multiple system operators and satellite tv providers and  we expect these competitors to market some of their products for use in tv over dsl applications 
for example  in the past  harmonic provided video content processing systems to sasktel  a large canadian telephone service provider 
harmonic also recently announced that it will provide video content processing systems to video networks limited  a video over dsl provider in the united kingdom 
our competition in the market for video transmission processing products primarily comes from small private companies such as skystream networks and public companies such as optibase inc and tandberg television that together offer a wide array of products with special features and functions 
our broadband transport and service management business tends to compete against public  private and foreign network equipment companies 
to the extent that any of these current or potential future competitors enter or expand further into our markets  develop superior technology and products or offer superior prices or performance features relative to our products  such competition could result in lost sales and severe downward pressure on our pricing  either of which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
commercial acceptance of any technological solution that competes with technology based on communication over copper telephone wire could materially and adversely impact demand for our products  our revenue and growth strategy 
the markets for video content processing  transmission and high speed data access systems and services are characterized by several competing communication technologies  including fiber optic cables  coaxial cables  satellites and other wireless facilities 
many of our products are based on communication over copper telephone wire 
because there are physical limits to the speed and distance over which data can be transmitted over copper wire  our products may not be a viable solution for customers requiring service at performance levels beyond the current limits of copper telephone wire 
our customer base is concentrated on telephone service providers that have a large investment in copper wire technology 
if these customers lose market share to their competitors who use competing technologies that are not as constrained by physical limitations as copper telephone wire  and that are able to provide faster access  greater reliability  increased cost effectiveness or other advantages  demand for our products will decrease 
moreover  to the extent that our customers choose to install fiber optic cable or other transmission media as part of their infrastructure  or to the extent that homes and businesses install other transmission media within buildings  demand for our products may decline 
the occurrence of any one or more of these events would harm demand for our products  which would thereby adversely affect our revenue and growth strategy 
if the projected growth in demand for video services from telephone service providers does not materialize or if our customers find alternative methods of delivering video services  future sales of our video content processing systems will suffer 
we manufacture video content processing systems that enable telephone service providers to offer video services to their customers 
our customers  the telephone service providers  face competition from cable companies  satellite service providers and wireless companies 
for some users  these competing solutions provide fast access  high reliability and cost effective solutions for delivering data  including video services 
telephone service providers hope to maintain their market share in their core business of voice telephony as well as increase their revenue per customer by offering their customers more services  including video services and high speed data services 
however  if the telephone service providers find alternative ways of maintaining and growing their market share in their core business that do not require that they offer video services  demand for our products will decrease substantially 
moreover  if technological advancements are developed that allow our customers to provide video services without upgrading their current system infrastructure  or that offer our customers a more cost effective method of delivering video services  sales of our video content processing systems will suffer 
alternatively  even if the telephone service providers choose our video content processing systems  the service providers may not be successful in marketing video services to their customers  in which case our sales would decrease substantially 
our operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and this may cause the price of our stock to decline 
over the last quarters  our sales per quarter have fluctuated between million and million 
over the same periods  our loss from operations as a percentage of revenue has fluctuated between approximately and  of revenue 
we anticipate that our sales and operating margins will continue to fluctuate 
we expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons  including the timing of customers purchase decisions  acceptance of our new products and possible cancellations  competitive pressures  including pricing pressures from our partners and competitors  delays or problems in the introduction of our new products  announcements of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  and management of inventory levels 
the sales cycle for video content processing systems is long and unpredictable  which requires us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result 
the sales cycle for our headend systems can be as long as months 
additionally  with respect to the sale of our products to us and foreign government organizations  we may experience long sales cycles as a result of government procurement processes 
as a result  while we continue to incur costs associated with a particular sale prior to payment from the customer  we may not recognize revenue from efforts to sell particular products for extended periods of time 
as a result  our quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and may not provide an accurate indicator of our future performance 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors  which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  our revenue  profitability and reputation could be harmed 
we rely on contract manufacturers and third party equipment manufacturers  or oems  to manufacture  assemble  test and package our products 
we also depend on third party suppliers for the materials and parts that constitute our products 
our reliance on contract manufacturers  oems and third party suppliers requires us to accurately forecast the demand for our products and coordinate our efforts with those of our contract manufacturers  oems and suppliers 
we often make significant up front financial commitments with our contract manufacturers  oems and suppliers in order to procure the raw materials and begin manufacturing and assembly of the products 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand or coordinate our efforts with our suppliers  oems and contract manufacturers  we may face supply  manufacturing or testing capacity constraints 
these constraints could result in delays in the delivery of our products  which could lead to the loss of existing or potential customers and could thereby result in lost sales and damage to our reputation  which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
further  we outsource the manufacturing of our products based on forecasts of sales 
if orders for our products exceed our forecasts  we may have difficulty meeting customers orders in a timely manner  which could damage our reputation or result in lost sales 
conversely  if our forecasts exceed the orders we actually receive and we are unable to cancel future purchase and manufacturing commitments in a timely manner  our inventory levels would increase 
this could expose us to losses related to slow moving and obsolete inventory  which would have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products in response to the rapid technological changes in the markets in which we compete  we will not remain competitive 
the markets for video content processing  transmission and high speed data access systems are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements and evolving industry standards 
to remain competitive  we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products 
for example  advancements in compression technology are leading the video content processing industry to begin the transition to next generation compression standards 
these advances will allow for further reductions in the bandwidth required to deliver standard definition video channels and introduce the possibility of delivering high definition television over asymmetric digital subscriber lines  or adsl  for the first time 
adsl is a new technology that allows more data to be transmitted over copper telephone lines than standard dsl 
further advances in compression technology  or the emergence of new industry standards would require that we further redesign our products to incorporate  and remain compatible with  emerging technologies and industry standards 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond quickly and effectively to technological change 
we may have only limited time to enter certain markets  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors can offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
if we fail to introduce new products that address technological changes or if we experience delays in our product introductions  our ability to compete would be adversely affected  thereby harming our revenue  profitability and growth strategy 
we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our revenue  which subjects our business to a number of risks 
if we are unable to generate significant international sales  our revenue  profitability and share price could be materially and adversely affected 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales and operating activities outside of the united states are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  restrictions on the export or import of technology  potentially limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow or maintain international revenue 
we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to represent a significant and growing portion of our revenue 
however  we cannot assure you that foreign markets for our products will develop at the rate or to the extent that we anticipate 
if we fail to generate significant international sales  our revenue  profitability and share price could be materially and adversely affected 
fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may decrease demand for our products 
substantially all of our foreign sales are invoiced in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive for international customers  thereby reducing demand for our products 
we anticipate that we will generally continue to invoice foreign sales in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we expand our current international operations  we may allow payment in foreign currencies and  as a result  our exposure to foreign currency transaction losses may increase 
to reduce this exposure  we may purchase forward foreign exchange contracts or use other hedging strategies 
however  we cannot assure you that any currency hedging strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
any such losses would adversely impact our profitability 
if our contract manufacturers  third party oems and third party suppliers fail to produce quality products or parts in a timely manner  we may not be able to meet our customers demands 
we do not manufacture our products 
we rely on contract manufacturers and oems to manufacture  assemble  package and test substantially all of our products and to purchase most of the raw materials and components used in our products 
additionally  we depend on third party suppliers to provide quality parts and materials to our contract manufacturers and oems  and we obtain some of the key components and sub assemblies used in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
neither we nor our contract manufacturers or oems have any guaranteed supply arrangements with the suppliers 
if our suppliers fail to provide a sufficient supply of key components  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources at reasonable prices  if at all  or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
moreover  if our contract manufacturers or oems fail to deliver quality products in a timely manner  such failure would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
delays and reductions in product shipments could increase our production costs  damage customer relationships and harm our revenue and profitability 
in addition  if our contract manufacturers and oems fail to perform adequate quality control and testing of our products  we would experience increased production costs for product repair and replacement  and our profitability would be harmed 
moreover  defects in products that are not discovered in the quality assurance process could damage customer relationships and result in product returns or product liability claims  each of which could harm our revenue  profitability and reputation 
design defects in our products could harm our reputation and our revenue  profitability and reputation 
any defect or deficiency in our products could reduce the functionality  effectiveness or marketability of our products 
these defects or deficiencies could cause customers to cancel or delay their orders for our products  reduce revenue or render our product designs obsolete 
in any of these events  we would be required to devote substantial financial and other resources for a significant period of time to develop new product designs 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in addressing any design defects in our products or in developing new product designs in a timely manner  if at all 
any of these events  individually or in the aggregate  could harm our revenue  profitability and reputation 
our business depends on the integrity of our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our revenue  profitability  reputation or growth strategy could be adversely affected 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents  trademarks and copyrights  by generally entering into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors  strategic partners and customers as needed  and by generally limiting access to and distribution of our trade secret technology and proprietary information 
however  any of our pending or future patent or trademark applications may not ultimately be issued as patents or trademarks of the scope that we sought  if at all  and any of our patents  trademarks or copyrights may be invalidated  deemed unenforceable  or otherwise challenged 
in addition  other parties may circumvent or design around our patents and other intellectual property rights  may misappropriate our proprietary technology  or may otherwise develop similar  duplicate or superior products 
further  the intellectual property laws and our agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights and effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
the telecommunications and data communications industries are characterized by the existence of extensive patent portfolios and frequent intellectual property litigation 
from time to time  we have received  and may in the future receive  claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
any present or future claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management time and attention and other resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  any such litigation could force us to cease selling or using certain products or services  or to redesign such products or services 
further  we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our intellectual property rights or those of competitors 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect upon our revenue  profitability  reputation or growth strategy 
if we fail to provide our customers with adequate and timely customer support  our relationships with our customers could be damaged  which would harm our revenue and profitability 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain customers will depend in part on the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stage 
as our systems and products become more complex  we believe our ability to provide adequate customer support will be increasingly important to our success 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products to a diverse customer base  and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis 
our failure to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
failure to provide adequate support could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and relationship with our customers  could thereby prevent us from gaining new customers and could harm our revenue and profitability 
if we fail to manage our expanding operations  our ability to increase our revenues and improve our results of operations could be harmed 
we anticipate that  in the future  we may need to expand certain areas of our business to grow our customer base and exploit market opportunities 
in particular  we expect to face numerous challenges in the implementation of our business strategy to focus on selling our products to the larger  more established service providers 
to manage our operations  we must  among other things  continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  hire and train additional qualified personnel  continue to expand and upgrade core technologies and effectively manage multiple relationships with various customers  suppliers and other third parties 
we cannot assure you that our systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to exploit fully the market for our products or systems 
if we are unable to manage our operations effectively  our revenue  operations and share price could be harmed 
if material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting were to develop such as those that our independent registered public accounting firm identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we were unable to remedy such weaknesses in an effective and timely manner  such weaknesses could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide the public with timely and accurate material information about our company  which could harm our reputation and share price 
in january  our independent registered public accounting firm identified deficiencies in our internal controls that they considered to be material weaknesses 
based on these weaknesses  our ceo and cfo determined that  as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures were not sufficient to record  process  summarize and report information required to be reported within the time periods specified by the sec and accumulated and communicated to our management  including our ceo and cfo  to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure 
these material weaknesses related to our inventory and our accounts payable processes  both of which affect our balance sheet and may also affect our income statement reporting 
we believe that we have fully addressed these issues  and  therefore  our chief executive officer s and chief financial officer s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december  concluded that they were effective 
see item a of this form k for further discussion of these weaknesses as well as for our chief executive officer s and chief financial officer s evaluation as of december  in order for investors and the equity analyst community to make informed investment decisions and recommendations about our securities  it is important that we provide them with accurate and timely information in accordance with the exchange act and the rules promulgated thereunder 
material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures would hinder the flow of timely and accurate information to investors 
if such material weaknesses were to develop and we did not address them in a timely matter  investors might sell our shares and industry analysts might either make incorrect recommendations about our company or else end coverage of our company altogether  any of which results could harm our reputation and adversely impact our share price 
we are currently engaged in a securities class action lawsuit  which  if it were to result in an unfavorable resolution  could adversely affect our reputation  profitability and share price 
we are currently engaged as a defendant in a lawsuit ie  whalen v 
tut systems  inc et al 
that alleges securities law violations against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors under section of the securities act of  as amended  and section b and rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
while we have reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in this lawsuit  the settlement is subject to certain contingencies  including court approval of the terms of settlement 
if the court does not approve this settlement  or any other applicable contingencies are not resolved or otherwise addressed  we would be required to resume litigation in this matter 
if we were to resume litigation in this matter  there is no assurance that we would prevail and  if the outcome of such litigation were unfavorable to us  our reputation  profitability and share price could be adversely affected 
if our products do not comply with complex government regulations  our product sales will suffer 
we and our customers are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local as well as foreign governmental regulation 
our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission  or fcc 
the fcc has issued regulations that set installation and equipment standards for communications systems 
our products are also required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  underwriters laboratories must certify certain of our products in order to meet federal safety requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
in addition  certain products must be network equipment building standard certified before certain of our customers may deploy them 
any delay in or failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
outside of the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which our products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
if we do not obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we would not be able to sell our products where these regulations apply  which could prevent us from maintaining or growing our revenue or achieving profitability 
in addition  regulation of our customers may adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  fcc regulatory policies affecting the availability of data and internet services and other terms on which telecommunications companies conduct their business may impede our entry into certain markets 
in addition  the increasing demand for communications systems has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards  generally following extensive investigation of competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process may cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers  which in turn may harm our sale of products to these customers 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to manage our business successfully  which could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy  reputation and share price 
we depend on the performance of salvatore d auria  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and on other senior management and technical personnel with experience in the video and data communications  telecommunications and high speed data access industries 
the loss of any one of them could harm our ability to execute our business strategy  which could adversely affect our reputation and share price 
additionally  we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to identify  hire  retain and motivate highly skilled employees who are in great demand 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we routinely evaluate acquisition candidates and other diversification strategies 
we have completed a number of acquisitions as part of our efforts to expand and diversify our business 
for example  we acquired our video content processing and video transmission businesses from tektronix in november when we purchased its subsidiary  vtc 
in order to provide additional financial resources  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with cosine communications  inc  or cosine on january  the proposed merger will be a stock for stock transaction valued at approximately million 
upon closing  we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock to the shareholders of cosine 
we expect the transaction to result in net cash to us of approximately million  and is expected to close as soon as practicable following approval by the stockholders of both companies 
we are acquiring cosine primarily to provide additional liquidity 
we will honor cosine s existing customer s support agreements  but do not expect to offer its products of sale to new customers 
we will not have any additional employees or facilities as a result of the transaction 
we intend to continue to evaluate new acquisition candidates  divestiture and diversification strategies  and if we fail to manage the integration of acquired companies  it could adversely affect our operations and growth strategy 
any acquisition involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s employees  operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees 
additionally  we may incur unanticipated expenses  difficulties and other adverse consequences relating to the integration of technologies  research and development  and administrative and other functions 
any future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  acquisition or divestiture related write offs and the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities 
any of the above factors could adversely affect our revenue  profitability  operations or growth strategy 
our stock price is volatile  and  if you invest in our company  you may suffer a loss of some or all of your investment 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock has been subject to significant volatility  and this trend may continue 
in particular  trading volume historically has been low and the market price of our common stock has increased dramatically in recent months 
since the announcement of our acquisition of vtc  the closing price of our common stock  as traded on the nasdaq national market  has fluctuated from a low of to a high of per share 
the value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
factors affecting our market price include our perceived prospects  variations in our operating results and whether we have achieved our key business targets  the limited number of shares of our common stock available for purchase or sale in the public markets  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts  products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  and market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors 
recent events have caused stock prices for many companies  including ours  to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance 
the general economic  political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
any such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
future sales of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
substantially all of our common stock may be sold without restriction in the public markets  subject only in the case of shares held by our officers and directors and affiliates to volume and manner of sale restrictions other than as described in the following sentence 
the approximately million shares of common stock that we issued to tektronix in connection with our november acquisition of vtc are restricted securities  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act  and therefore subject to certain restrictions 
however  we are contractually obligated to file and keep effective a registration statement in order to allow tektronix to sell these shares to the public 
likewise  tektronix has the right subject to certain exceptions to include these shares in certain registration statements pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market  whether or not in connection with this offering  or the perception that these sales could occur could materially and adversely affect our stock price and make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate 
our charter  bylaws  retention and change of control plans and delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and our retention and change of control plans  the plans  may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws and the plans could limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our charter and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  restrict our stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings  and provide for procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals

the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible financings or acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the plans provide for severance payments and accelerated stock option vesting in the event of termination of employment following a change of control 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws  and the plans  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law  to which we are subject  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change of control and prevent changes in our management
