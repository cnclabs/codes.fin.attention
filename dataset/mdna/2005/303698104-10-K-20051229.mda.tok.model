critical accounting policies on december   the securities and exchange commission issued release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
in response to release no 
 we reviewed our accounting policies 
the following areas require the use of judgments and estimates the valuation of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  pension and postretirement benefits  income taxes  environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangibles with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets 
impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life  these assets are tested for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist 
pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our employees 
our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the employee retirement income security act of or local statutory law 
the accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of and at september  and  respectively  and an estimated return on plan assets of at september  and assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
for measurement purposes  in  we assumed a annual rate of increase in the cost per capita of claims covered under health care benefits 
beginning in  the trend rate is assumed to decrease each year by to a rate of in and remain at that level thereafter 
the effect of any change in these assumptions may result in a large change to the accumulated benefit obligation 
deferred and noncurrent income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
all of our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at september  and september environmental matters our current and prior operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
to date  such laws and regulations have had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or net cash flows  and we have expended  and can be expected to expend in the future  significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities  remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters 
in connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate  we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition 
in addition  we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned  or previously owned  by us  which may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean up 
we are also a defendant in several lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters  and for injuries to persons or property allegedly caused thereby  and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various superfund sites 
at least once each calendar quarter  we thoroughly review our environmental matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters 
we believe that we have recorded adequate accruals in our consolidated financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions or other payments 
no amounts have been recorded as due from third parties  including insurers  or set off against  any environmental liability  unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability 
legal matters we are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business 
we  either on our own or through our insurance carriers  are contesting these matters 
at the end of each calendar quarter  we thoroughly review our legal matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  future results of operations  or net cash flows 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized immediately upon the sale of merchandise by our retail stores 
sales and related costs are recognized on shipment of products and or performance of services  when collection is probable 
lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues 
executive overview our business consists of three segments sports leisure  aerospace  and real estate operations 
our sports leisure segment is engaged in the design and retail sale of protective clothing  helmets and technical accessories for motorcyclists in europe and the design and distribution of such apparel and helmets in the united states 
our aerospace segment stocks a wide variety of aircraft parts  then distributes them to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers  fixed base operators  corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies worldwide 
our real estate operations segment owns and leases a shopping center located in farmingdale  new york  and owns and rents two improved parcels located in southern california 
for the year ended september   we reported a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million  as compared to a loss of million in the increased loss resulted primarily from poor operating results by hein gericke and ifw in our sports and leisure segment 
our loss in fiscal contributed significantly to our million use of cash in our operating activities 
as of september   we have unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  and available borrowing under lines of credit of million 
in addition  we expect to receive net cash of million from alcoa in february  under the terms of our sale agreement and million in january  related to the settlement of our stockholders derivative litigation 
we have undertaken a number of actions  which we believe will improve the results of hein gericke in and beyond including management changes  with emphasis on enhancing logistics 
implementation of a new computer system which provides improved sales and inventory management information and enhances operational efficiencies 
implementation of an online sales shop 
in addition  we plan to improve our operational efficiency by reducing back office overhead expenses  and in particular limit the reliance upon outside consultants and outside service providers 
promote our online internet shop 
identify strategic markets outside of germany and the united kingdom for possible expansion 
we expect that cash on hand  cash proceeds due to us from alcoa and the stockholder derivative litigation  cash available from lines of credit  and proceeds received from dispositions of short term investments  will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months 
in order to improve our liquidity  on december   we signed a definitive agreement to sell our farmingdale  new york  power shopping center  airport plaza  to krc acquisition corp  acting on behalf of a joint venture comprised of kimco realty corporation and a fund managed by a major investment bank  for approximately million 
the purchaser has agreed to deposit into escrow million to ensure its obligations and to seek the approval of our mortgage lender to assume our existing mortgage loan of approximately million  or to defease the loan 
the closing will take place following purchaser s obtaining consent of the mortgage lender to its loan assumption  which could occur as early as february if the loan is defeased  the transaction may not close until as late as july the sale does not include several other undeveloped parcels of real estate that we own in the town  the largest of which is under contract of sale to the market chain  stew leonards 
we decided to sell the shopping center to enhance our financial flexibility  allowing us to invest in existing operations or pursue other opportunities 
our cash needs are generally the highest during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year  when our sports and leisure segment purchases inventory in advance of the spring and summer selling seasons 
during fiscal  we had an million approximately million seasonal facility to help fund these cash needs 
that facility was repaid and has expired 
in december  the guaranty committee of the german state of north rhine westphalia recommended approval for an guaranteed seasonal financing facility  up to million 
one german bank has committed to provide funding for million approximately million of the seasonal facility and we anticipate completion of approval  loan agreements  and funding in january we are holding ongoing discussions with a second german bank  to receive a commitment for the remaining million of the seasonal facility  but we have not received a positive indication that it will be approved 
if we are unable to obtain a commitment from a second bank  we believe that our cash resources will be sufficient to meet our seasonal needs 
in december  we entered into discussions with an investment bank concerning our capital requirements 
on december   we engaged the investment bank to provide us  among other things  with a commitment to place a short term loan to us of million  against our agreement to sell our shopping center to krc acquisition corp 
the investment bank has indicated to us that it is highly confident that it can consummate the loan  if needed  during the period of our seasonal trough 
in the event that our cash needs are substantially higher than projected  particularly during our seasonal trough  we will take additional actions to generate the required cash 
these actions may include one or any combination of the following liquidating investments and other non core assets 
obtaining and utilizing borrowings available to us under a bridge financing agreement collateralized by the expected proceeds to be received from the sale of our shopping center 
eliminating  reducing  or delaying all non essential services provided by outside parties  including consultants 
significantly reducing our corporate overhead expenses 
settling our million interest rate swap agreement  which we have million of restricted funds in excess of our remaining liability 
delaying purchases of inventory 
however  if we need to implement one or more of these actions  there nevertheless remains some uncertainty that we will actually receive a sufficient amount of cash in time to meet all of our needs during the seasonal trough 
even if sufficient cash is realized  any or all of these actions may have adverse affects on our operating results and or businesses 
during the next several months  we plan to consummate the closing of our shopping center sale 
generate additional cash from borrowings and or the sale of other non core assets to support our operations and corporate needs 
implement the terms of a settlement of the stockholders derivative litigation 
results of operations significant business transactions on november   we acquired for million million substantially all of the worldwide business of hein gericke and the capital stock of intersport fashions west ifw from the administrator for eurobike ag in germany 
also on november   we acquired for million million from the administrator for eurobike ag and from two subsidiaries of eurobike ag all of their respective ownership interests in poloexpress and receivables owed to them by poloexpress 
we used available cash from investments that were sold to pay the administrator million million on november   and borrowed million million from the administrator at a rate of  per annum 
on may  we received financing from two german banks and paid the note due to the administrator 
the aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately million million  including million million of cash acquired 
on january   we acquired for million million all but of the interest owned by mr 
klaus esser in poloexpress 
mr 
esser retained a ownership interest in poloexpress  but fairchild has the right to call this interest at any time from march to october  for a fixed purchase price of million million at september  
mr 
esser has the right to put such interest to us at any time during april of for million million at september  
on january   we used available cash to pay mr 
esser million million and provided collateral of million million to a german bank to issue a guarantee to mr 
esser to secure the price for the put mr 
esser has a right to exercise in april of the transaction includes an agreement with mr 
esser under which he agrees with us not to compete with poloexpress for two years 
on october   we reached an agreement with mr 
esser  regarding his continued employment  and entered into an employment agreement with mr 
esser through december  through september   in addition to his base salary  mr 
esser received a profit distribution of approximately million  which reduces  on a euro for euro basis  the call or put option price we must pay for his interest 
as of september   the million million collateralized obligation for the put option  net of distributions  was included in other long term liabilities 
the million million restricted cash is invested in a capital protected investment and money market funds  and is included in long term investments 
the total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over net tangible assets was all allocated to identifiable intangible assets  including brand names hein gericke and polo  and reflected in goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as of september  since their acquisition on november   we have consolidated the results of hein gericke  poloexpress and ifw into our financial statements 
hein gericke  poloexpress and ifw are included in our segment known as sports leisure 
our sports leisure segment is a highly seasonal business  with an historic trend for higher volumes of sales and profits during march through september  when the weather in europe is more favorable for individuals to use their motorcycles than during october to february 
we acquired these companies because we believe they have potential growth  and may provide a platform for other entrees into related leisure businesses 
the acquired companies are european leaders of this industry  and opportunities for expansion are significant in europe and the united states 
hein gericke currently operates retail shops in austria  belgium  france  germany  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
poloexpress currently operates retail shops in germany and one shop in switzerland 
ifw  located in tustin  california  is a designer and distributor of motorcycle accessories  protective and other apparel  and helmets  under several labels  including hein gericke 
in addition  ifw designs and produces apparel under private labels for third parties 
ifw also distributes in the united states  products manufactured by or for other companies  under their own label 
the acquisition has lessened our dependence on the aerospace industry 
on june   we completed the sale of our fairchild aerostructures business for million to pca aerospace 
the cash received from pca aerospace is subject to a post closing adjustment based upon the net working capital of the business on january   compared with its net working capital as of june   which we have estimated to be approximately million  and is included in accounts receivable at september  pca aerospace disputes the working capital post closing adjustment  and also alleges that we owe pca aerospace million 
we have notified pca aerospace of our dispute of these claims 
in connection with the sale  we have deposited with an escrow agent approximately million to secure indemnification obligations we may have to pca aerospace 
the escrow period is eighteen months 
we decided to sell fairchild aerostructures  which was included in our aerospace segment  because we believe we received adequate fair value for a business whose performance was below our expectations and because its business was unrelated to other businesses we own 
we used million of the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of our cit revolving credit facility and we plan to use the remaining proceeds from the sale to reinvest in our existing operations 
in  we recorded a million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations  as a result of the sale of fairchild aerostructures 
on december   we completed the sale of our fastener business to alcoa inc for approximately million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
during the four year period from to  we are entitled to receive additional cash proceeds of million for each commercial aircraft delivered by boeing and airbus in excess of stated threshold levels  up to a maximum of million per year 
deliveries exceeded the threshold aircraft delivery level needed for us to earn the full million contingent payment for and  respectively 
accordingly  we recognized a million gain on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal and fiscal the remaining threshold aircraft delivery levels are in  and in on december   we deposited with an escrow agent million to secure indemnification obligations we may have to alcoa 
the escrow period remains in effect to december   but funds may be held longer if claims are timely asserted and remain unresolved 
the escrow is classified in long term investments on our balance sheet 
in addition  for a period ending on december   we are required to maintain our corporate existence  take no action to cause our own liquidation or dissolution  and take no action to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock 
consolidated results because of the november  acquisition of hein gericke  poloexpress  and ifw  collectively now known as fairchild sports  and the sale of the fasteners business on december   the discussion below cannot be relied upon as a trend of our future results 
additionally  fairchild sports is a highly seasonal business  with a historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during the months of march through september 
we currently report in three principal business segments sports leisure  aerospace  and real estate operations

we expect that cash on hand  cash generated from the earnout due to us from alcoa and proceeds due to us from the stockholder derivative litigation  cash available from lines of credit  and proceeds received from dispositions of short term investments  will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months 
in order to improve our liquidity  on december   we signed a definitive agreement to sell our farmingdale  new york  power shopping center  airport plaza  to krc acquisition corp  acting on behalf of a joint venture comprised of kimco realty corporation and a fund managed by a major investment bank  for approximately million 
the purchaser has agreed to deposit into escrow million to ensure its obligations and to seek the approval of our mortgage lender to assume our existing mortgage loan of approximately million  or to defease the loan 
the closing will take place following purchaser s obtaining consent of the mortgage lender to its loan assumption  which could occur as early as february if the loan is defeased  the transaction may not close until as late as july the sale does not include several other undeveloped parcels of real estate that we own in the town  the largest of which is under contract of sale to the market chain  stew leonards 
we decided to sell the shopping center to enhance our financial flexibility  allowing us to invest in existing operations or pursue other opportunities 
our cash needs are generally the highest during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year  when our sports and leisure segment purchases inventory in advance of the spring and summer selling seasons 
during fiscal  we had an million approximately million seasonal facility to help fund these cash needs 
that facility was repaid and has expired 
in december  the guaranty committee of the german state of north rhine westphalia recommended approval for an guaranteed seasonal financing facility  up to million 
one german bank has committed to provide funding for million approximately million of the seasonal facility and we anticipate completion of approval  loan agreements  and funding in january we are holding ongoing discussions with a second german bank  to receive a commitment for the remaining million of the seasonal facility  but we have not received a positive indication that it will be approved 
if we are unable to obtain a commitment from a second bank  we believe that our cash resources will be sufficient to meet our seasonal needs 
in december  we entered into discussions with an investment bank concerning our capital requirements 
on december   we engaged the investment bank to provide us  among other things  with a commitment to place a short term loan to us of million  against our agreement to sell our shopping center to krc acquisition corp 
the investment bank has indicated to us that it is highly confident that it can consummate the loan  if needed  during the period of our seasonal trough 
in the event that our cash needs are substantially higher than projected  particularly during our seasonal trough  we will take additional actions to generate the required cash 
these actions may include one or any combination of the following liquidating investments and other non core assets 
obtaining and utilizing borrowings available to us under a bridge financing agreement collateralized by the expected proceeds to be received from the sale of our shopping center 
eliminating  reducing  or delaying all non essential services provided by outside parties  including consultants 
significantly reducing our corporate overhead expenses 
settling our million interest rate swap agreement  which we have million of restricted funds in excess of our remaining liability 
delaying purchases of inventory 
however  if we need to implement one or more of these actions  there nevertheless remains some uncertainity that we will actually receive a sufficient amount of cash in time to meet all of our needs during the seasonal trough 
even if sufficient cash is realized  any or all of these actions may have adverse affects on our operating results and or businesses 
we may also consider raising cash to meet subsequent needs of our operations by issuing additional stock or debt  entering into partnership arrangements  liquidating assets or other means 
should the sale of our shopping center be delayed or not occur  we may be forced to liquidate other non essential assets  and significantly reduce overhead expenses 
in december  we obtained an additional amendment of a covenant on our loan agreement with two german banks 
the amendment provides a permanent waiver of specified inventory and accounts receivables that must be maintained by hein gericke deutschland 
the agreement requires hein gericke deuschland to maintain a ratio of current assets to net financial liabilities 
in december  we received german government approval for an guaranteed seasonal financing facility  up to million 
one german bank has committed to provide funding for million of the seasonal facility and we anticipate these funds will be available in early january 
we are holding ongoing discussions with a second german bank  to receive a commitment for the remaining million of the seasonal facility 
if we are unable to finalize the full seasonal line of credit  which we are negotiating  we may not have sufficient liquidity during the fiscal seasonal trough to support both our operations and our corporate needs 
if this were to occur during the seasonal trough  we believe we could generate sufficient additional cash through the sale of non core assets  including investments  to satisfy our cash requirements  recognizing  however  that there are impediments to the timely disposition of non core assets  which could adversely affect realization of their fair values 
because of the seasonal trough  we may also be required to reduce corporate expenses  however  such reductions may affect our efficiency  or result in the loss of personnel necessary for our business 
the costs of being a small to mid sized public company have increased substantially with the introduction and implementation of controls and procedures mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of audit fees and audit related fees have significantly increased over the past two years 
our increased costs also include the effects of acquisitions and additional costs related to compliance with various financing agreements 
we expect the costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of alone substantially increased our audit and related costs 
we estimate that we will incur expenses of approximately million in relation to audit and related fees in fiscal  as compared to only million in fiscal these increases are significant for a company of our size 
we are considering all options for reducing costs  including opportunities to take our company private in the coming year 
in february  we announced our intention to purchase up to  shares of our outstanding class a common stock 
through september   we acquired  shares at an average price of per share  and have not purchased any shares since may  off balance sheet items on september   approximately million of bank loans received by retail shop partners in the sports leisure segment were guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are not reflected on our balance sheet because these loans have not been assumed by us 
these guarantees were assumed by us when we acquired the sports leisure business 
we have guaranteed loans to shop partners for the purchase store fittings in certain locations where well sell our products 
the loans are secured by the store fittings purchased to outfit our retail stores 
contractual obligations at september   we had contractual commitments to repay debt including capital lease obligations  and to make payments under operating leases 
principal payments due under these long term obligations excluding pension obligations are as follows thereafter total long term debt and capital lease obligations   operating lease commitments     total contractual cash obligations    we have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others  issued primarily to guarantee our payments of workers compensation 
at september   we had contingent liabilities of million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit 
on september   we reflected a million obligation due under a ten year million interest rate swap agreement which expires on february  interest on the swap agreement is settled quarterly 
our operations enter into purchase commitments in the normal course of business 
prior to the sale of our fastener business  the pension benefit guaranty corporation had contacted us to understand the impact of the sale of our fasteners business on our ability to fund our long term pension obligations 
the pbgc expressed concern that our retirement plan would be underfunded by million after the sale of our fasteners business 
we provided the pbgc with information  which represented the underfunding to be million  using the pbgc plan termination assumptions 
during  we contributed million of cash to fund this pension plan 
based upon our actuary s recent assumptions and projections  we do not expect additional cash contributions to this pension plan to be required until current actuarial projections indicate contribution requirements of  in   in and a total of  in through we are required to make annual cash contributions of approximately million to fund a small pension plan 
in addition  we have million classified as other long term liabilities at september   including million due to purchase the remaining interest in poloexpress in april the remaining million of other long term liabilities include environmental and other liabilities  which do not have specific payment terms or other similar contractual arrangements 
at september   we have million of federal income tax loss carryforwards expiring through  and million of unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that does not expire 
these federal income tax loss carryforwards may be reduced by adjustments during the income tax audits of to or to  which have not been completed 
as the periods of assessment for to have expired  additional tax may be collected from us only for to nonetheless  the tax losses of million arising in     and may still be reduced for determining the proper amount of net operating loss available to be carried forward to years after the gains on the disposal of discontinued operations that we reported between to  for federal income tax  may be significantly increased if our tax positions are not sustained with respect to the sales of several businesses  and the repayment with property  of debt under a bank credit agreement in which both we and our subsidiaries were liable  is not treated as tax free under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
if all of these adjustments were made for to  the federal income tax loss carryforwards would be substantially reduced  and we may be required to pay additional tax and interest of up to million  which has already been provided 
the amount of additional tax and interest to be paid by the company depends on the amount of income tax audit adjustments  which are made and sustained for to these adjustments  if any  would be made at a future date  which is presently uncertain  and therefore we cannot predict the timing of cash outflows 
to the extent a favorable final determination of the recorded tax liabilities occurs  appropriate adjustments will be made to decrease the recorded tax liability in the year such favorable determination occurs 
we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million in which results primarily from the carryback of net operating losses under the year carryback rules in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  arising from october  to september  and the favorable resolution of tax audits of intersports fashions west inc for year ended september  and of a subsidiary in france for years ended june of to we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million in which results primarily from the carryback of net operating losses arising from july  to september  and october  to september   and the favorable resolution of the tax audit of kaynar technologies  inc for its final year ended april  and for our year ended june  we have a million non current income tax liability at september   which includes the tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards  temporary differences  and permanent differences 
it is presently uncertain when a final determination will occur since no internal revenue service audits of to or to have been completed 
should any of these liabilities become immediately due  we would be obligated to obtain financing  raise capital  and or liquidate assets to satisfy our obligations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
statement r amends certain aspects of statement and now requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be required to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
statement r provides some flexibility in allowing entities to determine the valuation model to use in calculating fair value  and whether to implement statement r on a prospective basis  a modified prospective basis or retroactively 
the statement becomes effective for us at the beginning of our next fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the effects of statement r 
such effect is not likely to be materially different from amounts we have previously disclosed in our filings since adopting statement in march  the financial accounting standards board published fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligation  to clarify that an entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin also defines when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is intended to provide a more consistent recognition of liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  additional information about expected future cash outflows associated with those obligations  and additional information about investments in long lived assets  because it recognizes additional asset retirement costs as part of the assets carrying amounts 
fin is effective no later than the end of our fiscal year ending september  we are currently assessing the possible impact  if any  of implementing this standard 
in june  the financial accounting standards board has published statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
the statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  although it carries forward some of their provisions 
the fasb believes that the statement s requirements will enhance the consistency of financial information between periods and is the result of the fasb s efforts to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate any impact from adopting this new standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities 
we may use  derivative financial instruments on a limited basis as additional risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate risk in fiscal  we entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt 
the ten year interest rate swap agreement provided us with interest rate protection on million of variable rate debt  with interest being calculated based on a fixed libor rate of to february  the variable rate debt that was fixed by the interest rate swap was repaid by us on december  on february   the bank  with which we entered into the interest rate swap agreement  did not exercise a one time option to cancel the agreement  and accordingly the transaction proceeds  based on a fixed libor rate of from february  to february  in fiscal  we have recognized million of non cash income as a result of the reduction in the fair market value for our interest rate swap liability from million  at september   to million at september  the fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease  and we will record income 
in may  we issued a floating rate note with a principal amount of million 
embedded within the promissory note agreement is an interest rate cap protecting one half of the million borrowed 
the embedded interest rate cap limits to  the month euribor interest rate that we must pay on the promissory note 
we paid approximately million to purchase the interest rate cap 
in accordance with sfas  the embedded interest rate cap is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt of the host contract and is not required to be separated and accounted for separately from the host contract 
we are accounting for the hybrid contract  comprised of the variable rate note and the embedded interest rate cap  as a single debt instrument 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date

these risks include the translation of local currency balances of our foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through our normal operating activities and  if we determine appropriate  we may consider utilizing foreign currency forward contracts in the future 
for the year ended september   approximately of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  with approximately of our total revenues denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we estimate that revenue and operating expenses for the year ended september  were higher by million and million  respectively  as a result of changes in exchange rates as compared to the year ended september  at september  we had million of working capital current assets minus current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
at september   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 
the following table shows the approximate split of these foreign currency exposures by principal currency at september  euro uk pound swiss franc total exposure revenues expenses working capital a hypothetical strengthening of the dollar during versus the foreign currencies in which we have exposure would have reduced revenue by approximately million and reduced operating expenses by approximately million  resulting in an operating loss of million less than actually reported 
working capital at september   would have been approximately million lower than actually reported  if we had used this hypothetical stronger dollar 
these numbers were estimated using the different hypothetical rate for the entire year and applying it evenly to all non united states dollar transactions 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended september  however  we cannot assure you that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition
