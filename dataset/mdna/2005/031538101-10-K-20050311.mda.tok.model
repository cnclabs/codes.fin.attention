item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the attached consolidated financial statements 
except for the historical information contained herein  the discussions in this section contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed below due to a number of factors  including the factors identified under factors that may affect our business and future results in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this report  and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our filings with the sec 
overview we are a leader in the design and manufacture of customer specific integrated analog mixed signal semiconductor products 
we focus on the automotive  medical and industrial markets  which have many products with significant real world  or analog  interface requirements 
we have organized our business into three operating segments integrated mixed signal products  mixed signal foundry services and structured digital products 
integrated mixed signal products combine analog and digital functions on a single chip to form a customer defined system level solution 
we also provide outsourced mixed signal foundry services for other semiconductor designers and manufacturers 
structured digital products  which involve the conversion of higher cost programmable digital logic integrated circuits into lower cost digital custom integrated circuits  provide us with growth opportunities and digital design expertise which we use to support the design of system solutions for customers in our target markets 
mixed signal foundry services provide us with an opportunity to further penetrate our target markets with our products and increase the utilization of our fabrication facilities 
when evaluating our business  we generally look at financial measures such as revenue  gross margins and operating margins 
we also use internal tracking measures  such as projected three year revenue from design wins and the capacity utilization of our fabrication facilities 
our projected three year design win revenue has increased in our target automotive  medical and industrial end markets by in when 
table of contents compared with we are seeing softening in our capacity utilization 
this is a measure of the degree to which our manufacturing assets are being used  thus sharing the fixed costs of these items across multiple products 
our gross margins could be negatively impacted by this in the future 
other key metrics we use to analyze our business include days sales outstanding dso and inventory turns 
dso decreased from days in to days in due to better accounts receivable collections performance 
inventory turns decreased from in to in due primarily to inventory built in the fourth quarter of in preparation for the relocation of our manila test facility and the transfer of our sort operations to manila  both of which are expected to begin in the second quarter of in june  we acquired the mixed signal business of alcatel microelectronics nv from stmicroelectronics nv 
we refer to this as the msb acquisition 
the msb acquisition increased our analog and mixed signal engineering team  enhanced our relationships with major european customers  provided us with additional high voltage and wireless technologies that enable us to offer new types of custom integrated circuits to our end markets and provided us with two fabs in oudenaarde  belgium 
the results of operations for and include msb for the entire period whereas the results of operations for includes msb for only the second half of in november  we acquired dspfactory ltd 
dspfactory  a leader in ultra low power digital signal processing technology for digital hearing aids and other low power applications 
the results of operations for include dspfactory from the date of acquisition 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we have identified revenue recognition  inventories  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes and stock options as areas involving critical accounting policies and the most significant judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition several criteria must be met before we can recognize revenue from our products and revenue relating to engineering design and product development 
we must apply our judgment in determining when revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue from products sold directly to end customers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  shipment is made and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain situations  we ship products through freight forwarders where title does not pass until product is shipped from the freight forwarder 
in other situations  by contract  title does not pass until the product is received by the customer 
in both cases  revenue and related gross profit are not recognized until title passes to the customer 
estimates of product returns and allowances  based on actual historical experience  are recorded at the time revenue is recognized and are deducted from revenue 
revenue from contracts to perform engineering design and product development are recognized as milestones are achieved  which approximates the percentage of completion method 
costs associated with 
table of contents such contracts are expensed as incurred 
a typical milestone billing structure is at the start of the project  at the creation of the reticle set and upon delivery of the prototypes 
since up to of revenue is billed and recognized at the start of the design development work and  therefore  could result in the acceleration of revenue recognition  we analyze those billings and the status of in process design development projects at the end of each reporting period in order to determine that the milestone billings approximate percentage of completion on an aggregate basis 
we compare each project s stage with the total level of effort required to complete the project  which we believe is representative of the cost to cost method of determining percentage of completion 
based on this analysis  the relatively short term nature of our design development process and the billing and recognition of of the project revenue after design development work is complete which effectively defers of the revenue recognition to the end of the contract  we believe our milestone method approximates the percentage of completion method in all material respects 
our engineering design and product development contracts generally involve pre determined amounts of revenue 
we review each contract that is still in process at the end of each reporting period and estimate the cost of each activity yet to be performed under that contract 
this cost determination involves our judgment and the uncertainties inherent in the design and development of integrated circuits 
if we determine that our costs associated with a particular development contract exceed the revenue associated with such contract  we estimate the amount of the loss and establish a corresponding reserve 
inventories we generally initiate production of a majority of our semiconductors once we have received an order from a customer 
based on forecasted demand from specific customers  we may build up inventories of finished goods  in anticipation of subsequent purchase orders 
we purchase and maintain raw materials at sufficient levels to meet lead times based on forecasted demand 
if forecasted demand exceeds actual demand  we may need to provide an allowance for excess or obsolete quantities on hand 
we provide an allowance for inventories on hand that are in excess of six months of forecasted demand 
forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales or inventory usage  expected future sales or using backlog and other projections and the nature of the inventories 
we also review other inventories for indicators of impairment and provide an allowance as deemed necessary 
we also provide an allowance for obsolete inventory  which is written off at the time of disposal 
we state inventories at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
property  plant and equipment and intangible assets we regularly evaluate the carrying amounts of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required based on current circumstances or events 
the evaluation  which involves significant management judgment  is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the related long lived assets  the carrying amount of the underlying assets will be reduced  with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying amount is equal to fair value  primarily determined based on future discounted cash flows 
to the extent such evaluation indicates that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment are different than originally estimated  the amount of future depreciation expense is modified such that the remaining net book value is depreciated over the revised remaining useful life 
we entered into a non compete agreement with nippon mining and its subsidiary in connection with our december  recapitalization 
according to this agreement  each of nippon mining and its subsidiary agreed to not engage in the custom semiconductor business anywhere in the world through december in our review of the carrying value of intangible assets  we reached a determination that the carrying value of the non compete had been impaired based primarily on a change in nippon mining s and its subsidiary s business focus and related capabilities such that they did not intend to focus on custom semiconductors 
effective june   we 
table of contents released nippon mining and its subsidiary from the non compete agreement and we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the non cash write off of the remaining value of the non compete provision of this agreement 
goodwill under the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned with the unit s net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  there is no deemed impairment of goodwill and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
we annually test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter 
since the inception of sfas no 
 our testing has not indicated any impairment 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized  including the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we may obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons of recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to these comparables 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount we determine is more likely than not to be realized  based on our analyses of past operating results  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and projected taxable income  including tax strategies available to generate future taxable income 
our analyses of future taxable income are subject to a wide range of variables  many of which involve our estimates and therefore our deferred tax asset may not be ultimately realized 
under the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation 
stock options we have elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
table of contents in accounting for employee stock options rather than adopting the alternative fair value accounting provided under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
therefore  we do not record any compensation expense for stock options we grant to our employees where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
deferred stock based compensation is recorded when stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices less than the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
historically  we generally determined the estimated fair value of our common stock based on independent valuations 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of approximately  in  prior to our initial public offering 
we comply with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which require that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options in determining net income or loss 
in calculating such fair value  there are certain assumptions that we use  as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements  included herein 
certain of our options that we issued in included options to purchase shares of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock 
under the terms of these options  the exercise prices changed in conjunction with changes in the accreted value of the related preferred stock 
we recorded and adjusted compensation expense each reporting period  as required under apb  for the intrinsic value generated by the change in the exercise price 
during the third quarter of  all options to purchase preferred stock were redeemed  with accrued amounts due being paid in october this redemption resulted in an additional charge to compensation expense of approximately million during the third quarter of results of operations the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results  as derived from our audited consolidated financial statements statement of operations data years ended december  dollars in millions revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in process research and development restructuring and impairment charges nonrecurring charges total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss

following the msb acquisition  approximately in  in and of our revenue in the second half of was denominated in euros 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature 
our product sales track the general market conditions seen throughout the semiconductor industry 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue in increased to million from million in in  we benefited from strong market conditions during the first half of the year 
during the second half of  we began to see the demand from some of our end markets weakening 
we experienced strong growth in our automotive  medical and industrial end markets  as revenues for in those markets increased in the aggregate over communications was the weakest end market  as revenues increased three percent in over communications revenues were particularly weak in the second half of  due primarily to the expiration of the take or pay arrangement with stmicroelectronics in june incremental revenues from our acquisition of dspfactory in november slightly offset weaker market conditions in the second half of according to gartner dataquest december  the application specific integrated circuit segment of the semiconductor industry grew by from to for both application specific integrated circuits  and application specific standard products  the market grew by in our acquisition of dspfactory provided us greater entry into the market for application specific standard products 
our revenues grew by over this same period  in line with the growth of the application specific integrated circuit segment  where the majority of our revenues were derived in integrated mixed signal sales of million increased over sales of million 
in  we saw steady growth across all end markets for this segment 
this segment saw both an increase in average selling prices  due to product mix improvements  and an increase in unit volume sold  due to strong market conditions  particularly during the first half of structured digital products revenue was million  an increase of over sales of million 
increased revenue from the computing  industrial and communications end markets  as well as revenue from our xpressarray tm products  helped to increase structured digital products sales in in the fourth quarter of we saw significant weakness in the communications end market for this segment 
for the full year  this segment saw a decrease in average selling prices due to changes in product mix  but an increase in unit volume sold  due to strong market conditions  particularly during the first half of mixed signal foundry services revenue was million  a decrease of from sales of million 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased sales to stmicroelectronics as a result of the expiration of the take or pay arrangement in june during  this segment experienced a decrease in unit volumes sold  due to the expiration of the take or pay agreement  but an increase in average selling prices due to improved product mix 
the following table represents our regional revenue for the years ended december north america europe asia gross profit cost of revenue consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
costs related to non recurring engineering fees are included in cost of revenue to the extent that they are reimbursed by our customers under a 
table of contents development arrangement 
costs associated with unfunded non recurring engineering are classified as research and development because we typically retain ownership of the proprietary rights to intellectual property that has been developed in connection with non recurring engineering work 
gross profit increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the increase in gross profit percentage is a result of our continued cost reduction efforts  increased utilization of our fabrication facilities  particularly in the first half of  and an increased percentage of higher margin products in the mix of the products we sold 
during  mixed signal foundry revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to from in this helped to increase our overall gross margin as margins in our mixed signal foundry segment are generally lower than the company average 
operating expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of activities related to process engineering  cost of design tools  investments in development libraries  technology license agreements and product development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this increase is primarily attributable to expenses related to increased design wins and the associated non customer funded expenses  as well as incremental expense from the dspfactory acquisition 
marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of commissions to sales representatives  salaries and commissions of sales and marketing personnel and advertising and communication costs 
marketing and selling expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in this increase is due to increased costs associated with higher sales levels 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of our administrative staff  professional fees related to audit and tax services and advisory fees for various consulting projects 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in this increase was primarily due to increases in professional fees associated with various consulting projects  including sarbanes oxley compliance 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets decreased to million in compared with million in this decrease is primarily due to amortization of an acquisition related intangible asset in  but not in  due to the impairment of the intangible asset in june this decrease was partially offset by increased amortization expense in related to amortization of intangible assets associated with the dspfactory acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for in process research and development related to the dspfactory acquisition 
no comparable amounts were recorded in we recorded million in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  compared to million in this amount includes charges for employee severance and other items as a result of our restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of this program includes headcount reductions related to the consolidation of our sort operations in the united states and belgium to the philippines as well as other reductions in force resulting from cost containment measures 
we expect to realize million per quarter in cost savings as a result of this action by the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the write off of the unamortized balance of an intangible asset that had no remaining value 
we entered into a non compete agreement with nippon mining and its subsidiary that was our former parent in connection with our december  recapitalization pursuant to which they agreed to not engage in the custom semiconductor business anywhere in the world through december in our second quarter review of the carrying value of intangible assets in  we reached a determination that the carrying value of the non compete had been impaired based primarily on a change in nippon mining s and our former parent s business focus and related capabilities such that they did not intend to focus on custom semiconductors 
effective june   we released nippon mining and our former parent from the non 
table of contents compete agreement and we expensed the million remaining unamortized balance of the agreement as of the effective date 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
this amount was primarily related to employee severance as a result of employee terminations and the termination of services with certain sales representative firms 
in september  we recorded nonrecurring charges of million 
this amount includes a one time payment of million associated with amendments to our advisory agreements as well as compensation expense of million related to the redemption of options to purchase our series a and series b preferred stock 
the advisory agreements were in place prior to our initial public offering and provided for citigroup venture capital cvc and francisco partners to provide financial  advisory and consulting services to us 
in conjunction with our ipo  we terminated the advisory agreement and the associated future scheduled annual fees 
these charges did not recur in operating income operating income increased to million in compared with million in  driven by increases in operating income across all of our segments and lower restructuring and nonrecurring charges in as compared with integrated mixed signal products operating income increased to million  or of segment revenue  in from million  or of segment revenue  in this increase is attributable to increased revenue levels and improved capacity utilization  which drove lower per unit product costs  particularly in the first half of structured digital products operating income increased to million  or of segment revenue  in from million  or of segment revenue  in this increase is attributable to improved product sales mix and improved factory utilization  which drove lower per unit product costs  particularly in the first half of mixed signal foundry services operating income increased to million  or of segment revenue  in from million  or of segment revenue  in this increase is primarily due to the decrease of low margin revenue associated with the stmicroelectronics take or pay agreement that had been in place for all of  but only the first half of net interest expense net interest expense for decreased to million  compared with million in the lower interest expense was primarily attributable to the decreased debt balance of our senior subordinated notes see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources and increased interest income related to our higher average cash balances in other expense other expense in decreased to million from million in this decrease is primarily due to the million non cash write off of deferred financing fees  the million premium paid in conjunction with the redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes and million relating to the settlement of hedging transactions  all of which occurred in income taxes income tax expense was million in  compared with an income tax benefit of million in the effective tax rate was in our effective tax rate in is favorably impacted by a reduction in our deferred tax valuation allowance because of improved operating results in the united states 
we have a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
based on the operating results of  we reversed approximately million of 
table of contents valuation allowance during we will continue to evaluate the need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based upon the anticipated pre tax operating results of future periods 
our effective tax rate was in the effective tax rate was unusually high as a percentage of our pre tax loss due to jurisdictional profit and loss mix 
jurisdictions with losses where tax benefits were recorded were those that generally had higher statutory tax rates  whereas jurisdictions with income where tax expense was recorded were those that generally had lower statutory tax rates 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue in increased to million from million in this increase is partially due to the inclusion of results related to the msb acquisition for the entire year in compared to only the second half of in  we also benefited from the revitalization of the economy as well as our increased focus on sales and marketing efforts 
we saw the most significant growth in the communications  automotive  medical and industrial end markets 
according to gartner dataquest  the application specific integrated circuit segment of the semiconductor industry grew by from to for both application specific integrated circuits  and application specific standard products  the market grew by in our revenues grew by over this same period  and we gained significant market share 
most of this gain was due to the significant increase in our capability as a result of the msb acquisition 
integrated mixed signal sales of million in increased over sales of million 
this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of results related to the msb acquisition for the entire year in compared to only the second half of in  we saw steady growth across all end markets for this segment 
mixed signal foundry services revenue grew to million  an increase of over sales of million 
growth was due to increased unit sales in the medical and computing end markets and strong sales to stmicroelectronics  which is related to the take or pay agreement put in place at the time of the msb acquisition 
results related to the msb acquisition were included for the entire period in compared to only the second half in structured digital products revenue was million  an increase of over sales of million 
increased revenue from the communications and military end markets  as well as revenue from our xpressarray tm products  helped to increase the structured digital products sales in the following table represents our regional revenue for the years ended december north america europe asia this shift in revenue toward europe is primarily due to the msb acquisition 
gross profit gross profit increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the increase in gross profit percentage is a result of our continued cost reduction efforts  increased utilization of our fabrication facilities and shifts in the mix of the products we sold 
during  a greater percentage of integrated mixed signal products were sold 
this helped to increase our overall gross margin 
we also sold more high margin structured digital products  including xpressarray tm and high margin defense products  which improved the margin in

amortization of acquisition related intangible assets decreased to million in compared with million in this is primarily due to the write off of an acquisition related intangible asset that occurred in june  whereas results included a full year of amortization 
we recorded million of restructuring and impairment charges in  compared to million in in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the write off of the unamortized balance of an intangible asset that had no remaining value

these expenses all related to the various debt transactions that occurred during  which did not occur in income taxes our income tax benefit was million in compared with income tax expense of million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in the fact that we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions is the primary reason that the income tax benefit represents such a large portion of the pre tax loss 
during we recorded pre tax losses in certain jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates while in other lower tax jurisdictions we recorded pre tax income 
furthermore  in certain foreign jurisdictions we consider the income to be permanently invested in the foreign entities  therefore  no additional us income tax provision has been recorded on the income from these lower tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources we have a borrowing capacity of million on a revolving basis for general corporate purposes under our senior credit facility 
at december   the entire amount was available under this senior credit facility 
our senior credit facility also includes a million term loan  which expires on september  the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of  together with unpaid and accrued interest  until the expiration date  when the balance becomes due 
at december   the outstanding principal balance under the term loan was million 
our senior credit facility  which includes the million term loan and a million revolving line of credit  the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes  and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future may impose various restrictions and covenants on us which could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
the restrictive covenants include limitations on consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  restrictions on creating liens  restrictions on paying dividends or making other similar restricted payments  restrictions on asset sales  restrictions on capital expenditures and limitations on incurring indebtedness  among other restrictions 
the covenants in the senior credit facility also include 
table of contents financial measures such as a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio  which become more restrictive over time 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the senior credit facility also limits our ability to modify our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
under our debt instruments  the subsidiaries of ami semiconductor  inc cannot be restricted  except to a limited extent  from paying dividends or making advances to ami semiconductor  inc our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs  meet required debt payments  including debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes and the senior credit facilities as amended  complete planned maintenance of equipment and to equip our fabrication facilities 
we anticipate that operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet working capital  interest payment requirements on our debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
although we believe these resources may also meet our liquidity needs beyond that period  the adequacy of these resources will depend on our growth  semiconductor industry conditions and the capital expenditures to support capacity and technology improvements 
we frequently evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders or restructure our long term debt to further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional borrowing or equity investment may be required to fund future acquisitions 
on march   we announced our intention to tender all of our outstanding million senior subordinated notes 
in addition  we announced our intention to refinance our senior credit facility 
the proceeds from the new senior credit facility along with existing cash will be used to pay the outstanding balance on the senior subordinated notes  the premium over par value on the senior subordinated notes and to repay the outstanding balance on the existing term loan 
we generated million in cash from operating activities in compared to million in this increase was attributable to an increase in net income offset by changes in working capital balances due to normal fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts and payments 
our significant sources and uses of cash can be divided into investing activities and financing activities 
during and  we invested in capital equipment in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
see capital expenditures below 
additionally  in we paid approximately million for the dspfactory acquisition  net of cash acquired

capital expenditures during  we spent million for capital expenditures compared with million during capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately of revenue 
these capital expenditures will primarily be used for new capacity  equipment replacement  yield improvement in our wafer fabrication facilities and the relocation of our sort operations in the united states and belgium to the philippines 
our annual capital expenditures are limited by the terms of the senior credit facilities 
we believe we have adequate capacity under the senior credit facilities to make planned capital expenditures

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock options in note of the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas no 
r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
because sfas no 
r provides for the use of differing valuation models and other required estimates such as an estimate of future forfeitures  we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
sfas no 
r also provides for optional modified prospective or modified retrospective adoption 
we have not yet made a determination on which adoption method we will choose 
we are currently evaluating these and other requirements under sfas no 
r and expect the adoption to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the ajca introduces a special tax deduction on qualified production activities 
fas clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with statement because of net operating loss carryforwards  it is unlikely that we will be able to claim this tax benefit during we do not expect the adoption of this new tax provision to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of the ajca introduces a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
we expect to repatriate a portion of our unremitted foreign earnings during see note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 


sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas shall be applied prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this statement was issued 
our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations outlook we expect our first quarter revenue to be down six to eight percent as compared to fourth quarter revenue due to continued weakness in the communications market and an inventory buildup at several key customers 
based on recent ordering patterns  we believe the first quarter will represent the trough in our revenues 
the beneficial effect of incremental product mix improvements  which have been a key driver of our gross margin expansion in the second half of  will not recur in the first quarter of additionally  we expect a further decrease in factory utilization in the first quarter  as a result of weaker market conditions 
as a result  we anticipate first quarter gross margins to be down approximately to basis points sequentially 
we expect operating margins  excluding restructuring charges and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of approximately to million in the first quarter  will be down to basis points sequentially  as we will continue to invest in research and development during this challenging market environment 
we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between percent and percent in the first quarter 
we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately eight percent of annual revenues 
depreciation and amortization is expected to be about million in the first quarter 
we base this outlook on our review of industry conditions  historical trends  estimates we make based on information from customers  and other factors and information 
should industry conditions  customer demand or other factors change  as often happens in our industry  our results could differ materially from those referenced in this outlook 

table of contents factors that may affect our business and future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
risks relating to our company and the semiconductor industry the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue and profit levels  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and our ability to respond to downturns is limited 
the semiconductor industry experienced the effects of a significant downturn that began in late and continued into our business was impacted by this downturn 
during this downturn  our financial performance was negatively affected by various factors  including general reductions in inventory levels by customers and excess production capacity 
in addition  our bookings and backlog decreased during the second half of  as compared to the first half of this resulted in lower revenue levels in the second half of  which we expect to continue into the first quarter of we cannot predict how long the current soft bookings environment will persist or to what extent business conditions will change in the future 
if the soft bookings environment persists  or business conditions change for the worse in the future  these events would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during industry downturns and for other reasons  we may need to record impairment or restructuring charges 
we have incurred impairment or restructuring charges in each of the last three fiscal years 
we eliminated approximately employee positions during the fourth quarter of and recorded in restructuring charges related thereto 
during we plan to relocate our test operations to a new larger facility in the philippines and to transfer our wafer sort operations in pocatello  idaho and oudenaarde  belgium to that new facility 
these changes will result in additional restructuring charges in which are expected to total approximately million to million 
in we recorded million in impairment charges and restructuring charges related to the impairment of an intangible asset  employee severance and the termination of relationships with certain sales representative firms 
in  we incurred a net non cash restructuring charge of million  consisting primarily of severance costs that occurred concurrently with the msb acquisition 
in the future  we may need to record additional impairment charges or further restructure our business and incur additional restructuring charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition if they are large enough 
due to our relatively fixed cost structure  our margins will be adversely affected if we experience a significant decline in customer orders 
we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can challenge our resources  reduce margins or harm our relationships with our customers 
we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers demands 
conversely  downturns in the semiconductor industry  such as the downturn that commenced late in and ended in  can and have caused our customers to significantly reduce the amount of products ordered from us 
in addition  we experienced a decrease in orders in the third and fourth quarters of due to general declines in the industry and an inventory policy change with one of our major medical customers 
reductions in customer orders have caused our wafer fabrication capacity to be under utilized 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand has an adverse effect on our gross margins and operating income 
reduction of customer demand also causes a decrease in our backlog 
there is also a higher risk that our trade receivables will be uncollectible during 
table of contents industry downturns or downturns in the economy 
any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from a relatively limited number of customers and devices  the loss of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if we lose major customers or if customers cease to place orders for our high volume devices  our financial results will be adversely affected 
while we served more than customers in  sales to our largest customers represented of our revenue during this period 
the identities of our principal customers have varied from year to year and our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels  or at all 
in addition  while we sold over  different products in  the top selling devices represented of our revenue during this period 
the devices generating the greatest revenue have varied from year to year and our customers may not continue to place orders for such devices from us at current levels  or at all 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  the loss of major customers or the curtailment of orders for our high volume devices within a short period of time would adversely affect our business 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers  which we have experienced as a result of the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry  have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  while we do not obtain long term purchase commitments  we generally agree to the pricing of a particular product for the entire lifecycle of the product  which can extend over a number of years 
if we underestimate our costs when determining the pricing  our margins and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to sell the inventories of products on hand  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in preparation for the move of our test facilities in the philippines and the consolidation of our sort facilities in belgium and the united states into the new facility in the philippines  we have built up inventories of certain products in an effort to mitigate or prevent any interruption of product deliveries to our customers 
in many instances  we have manufactured these products without having first received orders for them from our customers 
because our products are typically designed for a specific customer and are not commodity products  if customers do not place orders for the products we have built  we may not be able to sell them and we may need to record reserves against the valuation of this inventory 
if these events occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of these personnel could have a material effect on our business 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our chief executive officer  christine king  and our other key executives  managers and skilled personnel  particularly our design engineers 
generally our employees are not bound by employment or non competition agreements and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key executives and employees 
we may or may not be able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  skilled personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we depend on successful technological advances for growth  and a lack of such advances could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our industry is subject to rapid technological change as customers and competitors create new and innovative products and technologies 
we may not be able to access leading edge process technologies or to license or otherwise obtain essential intellectual property required by our customers 
if we are unable to continue manufacturing technologically advanced products on a cost effective basis  our business would be adversely affected 
we depend on growth in the end markets that use our products  and a lack of growth in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our continued success will depend in large part on the growth of various industries that use semiconductors  including our target automotive  medical and industrial markets  as well as the communications  military and computing markets  and on general economic growth 
factors affecting these markets as a whole could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  harm us 
these factors include recessionary periods or periods of reduced growth in our customers markets  the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards  the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance  and the possibility of reduced consumer demand for our customers products 
our industry is highly competitive  and a failure to successfully compete could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and includes hundreds of companies  a number of which have achieved substantial market share 
current and prospective customers for our custom products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors  as well as the merits of continuing to use standard or semi standard products 
some of our competitors have substantially greater market share  manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
we also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in specialized markets 
we expect to experience continuing competitive pressures in our markets from existing competitors and new entrants 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of other factors  including the following our ability to offer cost effective products on a timely basis using our technologies  our ability to accurately identify emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics  product introductions by our competitors  our ability to adopt or adapt to emerging industry standards  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
many of these factors are outside of our control 
in addition  in recent years  many participants in the industry have substantially expanded their manufacturing capacity 
if overall demand for semiconductors should decrease  this increased capacity could result in substantial pricing pressure  which could adversely affect our operating results 
because our products are typically designed for a specific customer and are not commodity products  we did not decrease our prices as significantly as many other companies in the semiconductor industry to try to maintain or increase customer orders during the downturn in the semiconductor industry from through  nor have we changed our pricing significantly since then 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not face increased pricing pressure in the future 

table of contents we may incur costs to engage in future acquisitions of companies or technologies and the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions may never be realized  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in june we completed our acquisition of the mixed signal business of alcatel microelectronics nv from stmicroelectronics nv 
in september we purchased the micro power products division of microsemi corporation 
in november we acquired substantially all of the assets of dspfactory ltd 
we may in the future make additional acquisitions of complementary companies or technologies 
the dspfactory acquisition as well as any future acquisitions are accompanied by risks  including the following potential inability to maximize our financial or strategic position  which could result in impairment charges if the acquired company or assets are later worth less than the amount paid for them in the acquisition  difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies  cost savings and revenue synergies  entry into markets or countries in which we may have limited or no experience  potential increases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and potential unknown liabilities associated with any such acquisition  diversion of management s attention due to transition or integration issues  difficulties in managing multiple geographic locations  cultural impediments that could prevent establishment of good employee relations  difficulties in retaining key personnel of the acquired business and potential litigation from terminated employees  and difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls and procedures and information systems 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any company or technologies that we might acquire in the future and our failure to do so could harm our business 
the benefits of an acquisition may take considerable time to develop and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will in fact produce the intended benefits 
in addition  our senior credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes may prohibit us from making acquisitions that we may otherwise wish to pursue 
risks relating to manufacturing our success depends on efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity  and a failure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an important factor in our success is the extent to which we are able to utilize the available capacity in our fabrication and test facilities 
utilization rates can be negatively affected by periods of industry over capacity  low levels of customer orders  operating inefficiencies  mechanical failures and disruption of operations due to expansion or relocation of operations and fire or other natural disasters 
in addition  our agreement with stmicroelectronics terminated in june and utilization of our fabs has declined as a result 
because many of our costs are fixed  a reduction in capacity utilization  together with other factors such as yield and product mix  could adversely affect our operating results 
the downturn in the semiconductor industry from to resulted in a decline in the capacity utilization at our wafer fabrication facilities 
in addition  our capacity utilization for the second half of declined from the first half and we expect capacity utilization in the first quarter of to continue to be lower 
if this continues  or if we enter another downturn  our wafer fabrication capacity may be under utilized and our inability to quickly reduce fixed costs  such as depreciation and other fixed operating expenses necessary to operate our wafer manufacturing facilities  would harm our operating results 

table of contents we could be adversely affected by manufacturing interruptions or reduced yields 
the fabrication of our integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled  clean room environment 
minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
we may experience problems in achieving acceptable yields in the manufacture of semiconductors  particularly in connection with the production of a new product  the adoption of a new manufacturing process or any expansion of our manufacturing capacity and related transitions 
the interruption of manufacturing  including power interruptions or the failure to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields at any of our wafer fabrication facilities  would adversely affect our business 
in addition  we will be moving our test operations to a to a new facility in the philippines beginning in the second quarter of and we will be moving our sort operations in the united states and belgium to this new facility 
if we experience delays or other technical or other problems during these moves  our ability to deliver products to customers may be affected 
we may face product warranty or product liability claims that are disproportionately higher than the value of the products involved  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated 
although we maintain rigorous quality control systems  in the ordinary course of our business we receive warranty claims for some of these products that are defective or that do not perform to specifications 
since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers  we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved 
we attempt  through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts  to limit our liability for defective products to obligations to replace the defective goods or refund the purchase price 
nevertheless  we have received claims in the past for other charges  such as for labor and other costs of replacing defective parts  lost profits and other damages see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
in addition  our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business 
and  even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims  we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation 
our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products  if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result 
we are dependent on successful outsourcing relationships  which dependence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have formed arrangements with other wafer fabrication foundries to supplement capacity and gain access to more advanced digital process technologies 
if we experience problems with our foundry partners  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we believe that in the future we will increasingly rely upon outsourced wafer manufacturing to supplement our capacity and technology 
if any foundries with which we form an outsourcing arrangement  experience wafer yield problems or delivery delays  which are common in our industry  or are unable to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications with acceptable yields  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we rely on test subcontractors  which reliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the testing of semiconductors is a complex process requiring  among other things  a high degree of technical skill and advanced equipment 
we are increasing our outsourcing of semiconductor testing to subcontractors  most of which are located in southeast asia 
in particular  we plan to rely heavily on a 
table of contents single subcontractor for this activity 
if our subcontractors experience problems in testing our semiconductor devices  our operating results would be adversely affected 
we rely on packaging subcontractors  which reliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
most of our products are assembled in packages prior to shipment 
the packaging of semiconductors is a complex process requiring  among other things  a high degree of technical skill and advanced equipment 
we outsource our semiconductor packaging to subcontractors  most of which are located in southeast asia 
in particular  we rely heavily on a single subcontractor for packaging 
we depend on these subcontractors to package our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
if our subcontractors experience problems in packaging our semiconductor devices or experience prolonged quality or yield problems  our operating results would be adversely affected 
we depend on successful parts and materials procurement for our manufacturing processes  which dependence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we use a wide range of parts and materials in the production of our semiconductors  including silicon  processing chemicals  processing gases  precious metals and electronic and mechanical components 
we procure materials and electronic and mechanical components from domestic and foreign sources and original equipment manufacturers 
however  there is no assurance that  if we have difficulty in supply due to an unforeseen catastrophe  worldwide shortage or other reason  alternative suppliers will be available or that these suppliers will provide materials or electronic or mechanical components in a timely manner or on favorable terms 
if we cannot obtain adequate materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms  our business and financial results would be adversely affected 
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
semiconductor companies that maintain their own fabrication facilities have substantial capital requirements 
we made capital expenditures of million in and million in of these expenditures were used to expand capacity in our eight inch fabrication facility in and replace equipment and expand our test and design capabilities in both years 
in the future  we intend to continue to make capital investments to support business growth and achieve manufacturing cost reductions and improved yields 
we may seek additional financing to fund further expansion of our wafer fabrication capacity or to fund other projects 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors 
additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  as well as our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and our inability could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as of december   we held us patents and foreign patents 
we also had over patent applications in progress 
at the end of  approximately of the patents we currently have in place will be expiring 
we do not expect this to have a material impact on our results  as these technologies are not revenue producing and we will be able to continue using the technologies associated with these patents 
we intend to continue to file patent applications when appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies 
the process of seeking patent protection takes a long time and is expensive 
we cannot assure you that patents will issue from pending or future applications or that  if patents issue  they will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
in addition  we cannot assure you 
table of contents that other countries in which we market our services will protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states 
we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  by confidentiality agreements 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach 
our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we have no means of knowing what patent applications have been filed in the united states until they are published 
in january  ricoh company  ltd 
filed in the us district court for the district of delaware a complaint against us and other parties alleging infringement of a patent owned by ricoh 
the case was transferred to the us district court for the northern district of delaware in august and was subsequently transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california 
ricoh is seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement 
the patents relate to certain methodologies for the automated design of custom semiconductors 
based on information available to us to date  our belief is that the asserted claims are without merit or  if meritorious  that we will be indemnified with respect to damages for these claims by synopsys  inc and resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial results or financial condition 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we have from time to time received communications from third parties asserting rights under patents that cover certain of our technologies and alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights of others 
we analyze these claims as best we can given the information available and applicable legal principles 
recently  we have been in discussions with three companies who claim that certain of our products infringe a number of their patents relating to certain manufacturing processes 
our discussions to date have not resulted in a resolution of these matters 
at this time  the overall validity or invalidity of the claims cannot be determined with any certainty and we cannot predict whether any litigation will ensue  or what the outcome of any such litigation might be 
we expect to receive similar communications in the future 
in the event that any third party had a valid claim against us or our customers  we could be required to discontinue using certain process technologies which could cause us to stop manufacturing certain semiconductors  pay substantial monetary damages  seek to develop non infringing technologies  which may not be feasible  or seek to acquire licenses to the infringed technology  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in the event that any third party causes us or any of our customers to discontinue using certain process technologies  such an outcome could have an adverse effect on us as we would be required to design around such technologies  which could be costly and time consuming 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our resources  may also be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
if we fail to obtain a necessary license or if litigation relating to patent infringement or any other intellectual property matter occurs  our business could be adversely affected 
we could incur material costs to comply with environmental laws  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
increasingly stringent environmental regulations restrict the amount and types of pollutants that can be released into the environment from our operations 
we have incurred and will in the future incur costs  including capital expenditures  to comply with these regulations 
significant regulatory changes or increased public attention to the impact of semiconductor operations on the environment may result in 
table of contents more stringent regulations  further increasing our costs or requiring changes in the way we make our products 
for example  belgium has enacted national legislation regulating emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide 
in addition  because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes  we are subject to risks of accidental spills or other sources of contamination  which could result in injury to the environment  personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines  any of which could be material to our cash flow or earnings 
for example  we have recently received concurrence with a proposal to curtail pumping at one of our former manufacturing sites 
ongoing monitoring and reporting is still required 
if levels significantly change in the future additional remediation may be required 
in addition  at some point in the future  we will have to formally close and remove the extraction wells and treatment system 
the discovery of additional contamination at this site or other sites where we currently have or historically have had operations could result in material cleanup costs 
these costs cold have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to our international operations our international sales and operations expose us to various political and economic risks  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
as a percentage of total revenue  our revenue outside of north america was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
our manufacturing operations are located in the united states and belgium  our test facilities and our primary assembly subcontractors are located in asia and we maintain design centers and sales offices in north america  europe and asia 
international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater risk of uncollectible accounts  longer collection cycles  logistical and communications challenges  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  changes in labor conditions  burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  political and economic instability  increases in duties and taxation  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue and costs are denominated in foreign currencies  including the euro and  to a lesser extent  the philippine peso and the japanese yen 
euro denominated revenue represented approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue in as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect our revenue  cost of revenue and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
from time to time  we will enter into exchange rate hedging programs in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 

table of contents however  we cannot assure you that any hedging transactions will be effective or will not result in foreign exchange hedging losses 
we are exposed to foreign labor laws due to our operational presence in europe  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we had employees in europe as of december   most of whom were in belgium 
the employees located in belgium are represented by unions and have collective bargaining arrangements at the national  industry and company levels 
in connection with any future reductions in work force we may implement  we would be required to  among other things  negotiate with these unions and make severance payments to employees upon their termination 
in addition  these unions may implement work stoppages or delays in the event they do not consent to severance packages proposed for future reductions in work force or for any other reason 
furthermore  our substantial operations in europe subject us to compliance with labor laws and customs that are generally more employee favorable than in the united states 
as a result  it may not be possible for us to quickly or affordably implement workforce reductions in europe 
risks relating to our substantial debt our substantial consolidated indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
ami semiconductor  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct all our business operations  has a substantial amount of indebtedness  most of which is guaranteed by us 
we are a holding company with no business operations and no significant assets other than our ownership of ami semiconductor s capital stock 
as of december   our consolidated indebtedness was approximately million and our total consolidated debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 
subject to the restrictions in the senior credit facilities and the senior subordinated notes  our subsidiaries and we may incur certain additional indebtedness from time to time 
our substantial consolidated indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  our substantial indebtedness will require our operating subsidiaries to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments in respect of indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  could increase the amount of our consolidated interest expense because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which  if interest rates increase  could result in higher interest expense  will increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions  could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or the industry in which we operate  could restrict us from making strategic acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and could limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
to service our consolidated indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our consolidated indebtedness and to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future

table of contents historical financial results have been  and we expect our future financial results will be  subject to substantial fluctuation based upon a wide variety of factors  many of which are not within our control 
these factors include the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets for our products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  the timing of introduction of new products  the timing of customer orders  changes in the mix of products sold and the end markets into which they are sold  the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  the length of the lifecycle of the semiconductors we are manufacturing  availability of supplies and raw materials  price competition and other competitive factors  and work stoppages  especially at our fabs in belgium 
unfavorable changes in any of these factors could harm our operating results and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness 
if we are unable to service our debt using our operating cash flow  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling equity securities  each of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  certain of these strategies would require the consent of our senior secured lenders 
restrictions imposed by the senior credit facilities and the senior subordinated notes limit our ability to take certain actions 
we cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our debt instruments  including the senior credit facilities and the senior subordinated notes  will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
the senior credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios  which become more restrictive over time 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
in  and  the lenders under our senior credit facility and we agreed to certain amendments  including changes to our financial covenants and restrictions on our capital expenditures 
we also sought and obtained certain waivers and consents under our senior credit facilities 
we may be required to seek waivers or consents in the future 
we cannot be sure that these waivers or consents will be granted 
a breach of any of the covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our senior credit facilities 
in the event of any default under the senior credit facilities  the lenders under our senior credit facilities will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings 
if we are unable to repay any such borrowings when due  the lenders could proceed against their collateral  which consists of substantially all of our assets  including of the outstanding stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
if the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
in addition  the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  engage in

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
these risks primarily relate to the sale of products and services to foreign customers and changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
the majority of our revenue in was denominated in us dollars 
additionally  the majority of our operating costs were denominated in us dollars 
therefore  foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our financial results 
however  operations related to our msb acquisition were only consolidated with ours for six months of  therefore  our operating results were not affected as greatly by transactions denominated in foreign currencies as they were in and when a substantial portion of our annual sales and operating costs were denominated in euros 
additionally  we have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation or remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed to fluctuations include the euro  the japanese yen and the philippine peso 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
as of december   approximately of our consolidated net assets were attributable to subsidiaries that prepare their financial statements in foreign currencies 
as such  a change in the us dollar exchange rates in effect as of december  would cause a change in consolidated net assets of approximately million 
at december   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency hedging contracts  however  during  we did enter into certain hedging transactions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an adjustable margin under our credit agreement 
a change of in the interest rate would cause a change of approximately million in interest expense 
in january  we issued million of fixed rate senior subordinated notes 
as of december   million of this issuance was outstanding 
because our interest rate is fixed  changes in market interest rates do not impact our interest expense
