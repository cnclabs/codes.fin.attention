recent developments hurricane katrina in late august a devastating hurricane hit the gulf coast of mississippi and louisiana causing substantial damage to the gulfport and biloxi  mississippi area  as well as new orleans  louisiana 
this is a very dynamic situation and our concerns were first to determine the safety of our employees and their families  second to secure our gulfport facility and third to execute our recovery plan for the recommencement of full operations 
all of our employees are safe and we have established a fund to assist our employees impacted by the hurricane  and we made an initial  contribution to this fund 
we are also accepting employee contributions to this fund 
our gulfport regional sales and distribution facility services both the states of mississippi and louisiana 
initial indications are that the building is structurally sound  although the building did sustain some damage which we need to further assess 
we have secured the facility to the best of our ability given the circumstances 
this facility monitors our mississippi wap operation and needs both power and telephone service to be restored in order to operate 
we are working with local authorities to determine the timeframe when such services may be restored  but restoration of these services could take several months 
we are also exploring alternatives for operating the mississippi wap 
we carry property insurance and business interruption insurance and are actively working with our insurance carriers on assessing our losses 
the business interruption insurance covers a period of up to days after we re open our gulfport facility 
the insurance company claim assessors need to inspect our premises and the area in general as the next step in the insurance claim process  and the entire claim process is expected to take an extended period of time 
initial indications are that the casinos in the biloxi and gulfport areas will need to be rebuilt and will not open for a protracted period of time 
some casinos may decide not to rebuild 
casinos in new orleans may need major reconstruction and  given the devastation to the area  may be closed for months 
casinos outside of these areas may also need some restoration and some have not had electricity service restored  but others have reopened for business for the most part  although their business may be at lower than historical levels 
in fiscal  we sold just over  new gaming machines to casinos in the biloxi and gulfport areas and in new orleans and of our installed base of participation games or units were in these casinos when the hurricane struck 
an additional wap gaming machines in casinos throughout mississippi are currently impacted by the wap monitoring room being inoperable 
total revenues from casinos in the biloxi and gulfport areas and casinos in new orleans amounted to approximately million or of our total revenues in fiscal general our principal executive offices are located at south northpoint blvd  waukegan  illinois  and our telephone number is our internet website address is www

company overview we design  manufacture and market innovative gaming machines and vlts for class iii gaming markets  we license our game themes to third parties for class ii and class iii gaming and we manufacture gaming machines under original equipment manufacturing agreements  or oem agreements  with multimedia games  inc for the class ii gaming market 
there are three classes of gaming markets class i gaming includes traditional native american social and ceremonial games 
class i gaming is regulated exclusively at the native american tribe level 
we do not serve this market 
class ii gaming includes bingo  electronic aids to bingo  and  if played at the same location where bingo is offered  pull tabs and other games similar to bingo 
class ii gaming is regulated by individual native american tribes  with the national indian gaming commission having oversight of the tribal regulatory process 
class iii gaming includes all other forms of gaming that are not included in either class i or class ii  including slot machines 
we seek to develop games and gaming machines that offer high entertainment value and generate greater revenues for casinos and other gaming machine operators than the games and gaming machines offered by our competitors 
our gaming machines feature advanced graphics  digital sound and engaging game themes  and most incorporate secondary bonus rounds 
some of our games use licensed  well recognized brands such as monopoly  hollywood squares  and men in black and in fiscal we will launch games using the world series of poker and powerball brands 
in designing our games and gaming machines  our designers  engineers  artists and development personnel build upon our almost years of experience in designing and developing entertaining and exciting games 
our gaming machines are installed in all of the major regulated gaming jurisdictions in the united states  as well as in over foreign gaming jurisdictions 
for fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million in total revenues  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal and was due to increased product sales and gaming operations revenues following receipt of regulatory approvals for bluebird  cpu nxt and new game themes beginning in mid fiscal we generate revenue in two principal ways 
first  we generate product sales revenues from the sale of new and used gaming machines and vlts  conversion kits  including theme and or operating system conversions  parts  and original manufactured equipment to casinos and other licensed gaming machine operators 
for fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million in product sales revenues  respectively 
second  we earn gaming operations revenues from leasing participation games and vlts and earn royalties that we receive from third parties under license agreements to use our game content 
participation games  as used throughout this report  refers to gaming machines that we lease based upon any of the following payment methods a percentage of the net win of the gaming machines  fixed daily fees  or in the case of wide area progressive games  a percentage of the amount wagered 
for fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million in gaming operations revenue  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal was due to receipt of regulatory approvals and introduction of several wide area progressive games and the expansion of our installed base of participation games from  units at june  to  units at june  in early fiscal  we began offering our customers a new dual screen series of gaming machines where the casino can a pay a standard participation lease rate  or b buy the base gaming machine at the standard price and pay a lower daily lease fee for the use of the software and top box  or c buy the base gaming machine at the standard price and pay a premium price to purchase the software and top box 
we offer our vlts either for sale or on a leased basis  but we do not include leased vlts in our installed base of participation games 
revenue from leased vlts  which is less than of total consolidated revenue  is included in gaming operations revenue as are royalties we earn from licensing our game content to third parties 
in fiscal  we introduced the first of our participation games  a series of four monopoly themed gaming machines  under our exclusive license to use the widely recognized monopoly trademark on casino style gaming machines 
since then  we have continued to introduce additional monopoly and other themed gaming machines 
our portfolio of participation games now includes games based upon the monopoly  hollywood squares  men in black and a fistful of dollars brands  among others 
we offer non linked participation games  which at june  comprised almost of our installed base of participation games  and linked wide area progressive  or wap  games comprised the balance of the installed base 
a wap system links gaming machines in multiple casinos within a gaming jurisdiction to contribute to and compete for large system wide progressive jackpots 
wap systems are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a non linked  stand alone gaming machine 
net win per gaming machine on wap systems is generally higher than on non linked gaming machines on a casino floor 
we expect the demand for games linked to our wide area progressive jackpot system to increase 
in fiscal  we began offering local area jackpot systems and we believe demand will increase for games linked to our local area progressive jackpot system 
a local area progressive jackpot system links gaming machines within a single casino to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino  whereas a wide area progressive jackpot system links gaming machines in multiple casinos to a progressive jackpot for all casinos within a gaming jurisdiction 
we received our first regulatory approvals for our proprietary wap system  in may and launched the monopoly money themed progressive jackpot in nevada and in native american casinos 
in september  we received colorado gaming commission approval for our wap system and launched the product in colorado casinos 
we received mississippi gaming commission approval for our wap system in january in late march  we received regulatory approval for a day limited roll out of our wap system from the new jersey casino control commission and received unlimited regulatory approval in july we started a field trial of our wap system in arizona casinos in july and expect to receive regulatory approval in september the first wap system we launched was monopoly money 
in january  we launched our second wap system titled a fistful of dollars featuring clint eastwood and  by june   this second wap series of games was operating in nevada  colorado  mississippi and native american casinos 
through september  thirty two jackpot winners have won an aggregate of over million in progressive jackpots 
in jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system  we commercialize these games as participation games leased on a non linked basis 
we have the ability to place these games on a participation basis because the popularity of the brand and the superior performance of the game generates higher wagering and net win to the casinos or gaming machine operators than the games we sell to casinos or other gaming machine operators 
our participation game installed base consisted of  participation gaming machines  including wap games as of june   generated average daily revenue to us of per gaming machine for fiscal  and together with our other gaming operations revenue sources  achieved a gross margin during fiscal the products that we sold throughout fiscal and consisted primarily of multi coin  multi line video gaming machines 
we are one of the original developers of multi coin  multi line video gaming machines in the us market 
our video gaming machines include engaging themes  advanced graphics and digital sound effects and music 
we have also developed and began selling our mechanical reel spinning gaming machines and poker games  which we shipped to customers in fiscal as part of our efforts to fully serve the gaming machine needs of our casino customers 
in  we experienced software anomalies in the operating system software that drives our gaming machines  and certain of these anomalies permitted player cheating 
as a result of these anomalies and the publicity concerning them  we experienced delays in receiving approvals for new games pending completion of regulatory review of upgrades to our operating system software 
these delays resulted in both lower game sales and lower participation game revenues because we were unable to refresh our installed base of participation games on our planned schedule 
to address the software anomaly issues and to revitalize our technology foundation  in january  we announced a three part technology improvement plan to improve the stability of the operating system software 
in fiscal  we stabilized our existing operating system software and began to receive approvals for new games 
we also met key milestones on the mid term phase of our technology improvement plan  which consisted of developing a new operating system and computer circuit board called cpu nxt 
in mid fiscal  we began shipping new games using our new cpu nxt operating system in the bluebird cabinet 
in fiscal  we expanded our product offerings to include video poker and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines  and we offered an increased number of new game themes 
by september  we received substantially all of the regulatory approvals required in north america to ship cpu nxt  bluebird  video poker games and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
we believe that the introduction of an increasing number of games and a broader range of new products has enabled us to increase product sales  participation game installations and profitability 
industry overview casino operators continuously seek to increase revenue growth and profitability at their casinos 
the importance of gaming machine revenue to casino operators profitability has created demand for gaming machines that have the ability to generate superior net win 
as a result  the pace of innovation in game design has accelerated  and gaming equipment manufacturers have increasingly focused on enhancing the overall entertainment value of games and gaming machines 
we believe that four of the most significant recent developments in gaming machine design have been the development of video gaming machines that simulate mechanical reel spinning gaming machines  the introduction of gaming machines with secondary bonus rounds  cashless gaming and low denomination wagering coupled with local area and wide area progressive jackpots 
video gaming machines that simulate a mechanical reel spinning gaming machine on a video screen are predominantly multi coin  multi line gaming machines that offer multiple distinct pay lines and allow up to or more coins to be wagered on a single play 
this tends to increase the average wager per play 
secondary bonusing allows a player to advance beyond the primary game into a bonus round if the player attains a specified result in the primary game 
the bonus rounds are designed to create significant player appeal by giving the player more interactive options and a sense of investment in the game 
this encourages the player to continue to play the primary game in an effort to achieve all of the bonus rounds in a game 
in addition  the bonus rounds give game designers an opportunity to incorporate additional entertaining content into the game 
various forms of cashless gaming reduce casino operators costs and machine downtime as coins are no longer dispensed from the gaming machine when a casino patron wants to cash out 
instead  the gaming machine prints tickets or  through casino systems  banks the payout in an account for the casino patron 
this technology has proven popular with casino patrons and casino operators 
low denomination video and mechanical reel games coupled with local and wide area progressive jackpots allow the casino patron more flexibility in wagering a lower number of coins with multiple chances to win 
lower denomination settings are cent  cents  cents  cents and cents 
most penny slots average lines and up to credits per line coins  or  per play  based on the maximum possible wager 
with secondary bonuses and local or wide area progressive jackpots  players can win large amounts on a single wager 
the growing popularity of the low denomination gaming machines has significantly impacted the evolution of game development technology 
we expect continued demand for multi coin  multi line video gaming machines and other gaming machines that offer the player secondary bonus rounds and other enhanced entertainment features  which we believe result in higher amounts wagered and net win per machine for casinos 
as casino operators continue to adopt cashless gaming in their casinos  we expect that most of the gaming machines we sell or place in casinos will support cashless gaming 
we believe that server based gaming will be the next significant technology development in the gaming machine industry 
server based gaming refers to a gaming system in which game content and peripherals are configured  maintained and refreshed over a network that links groups of gaming machines to a remote server which also enables custom configuration by operators and central determination of game outcomes 
server based gaming initiatives will require regulatory approval in gaming jurisdictions prior to any implementation 
see government regulation 
some of the gaming machines with secondary bonusing features and entertaining themes generate significantly more coin in per day than the other gaming machines on the casino floors  allowing gaming machine manufacturers to lease some of the highest earning machines to casino operators as participation games 
this allows gaming machine manufacturers to share in the superior earnings of these games and to generate a recurring revenue stream for themselves 
vlts include both video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
vlts are sold  leased to  or operated as participation games by government agencies that desire to raise revenue for the jurisdictions in which they operate 
most vlts are linked to a central computer for accounting and security purposes and are monitored by state lotteries or other government authorities 
unlike gaming machines designed for the casino market  most vlts are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
in the last decade  several us states including new york  delaware  oregon and rhode island have enacted legislation permitting vlts 
business strategy our business strategy is to increase our market penetration in major regulated gaming jurisdictions worldwide by developing entertaining products and providing outstanding service 
this strategy includes the following elements our technology foundation in january  we embarked on a technology improvement plan designed to stabilize and update our existing operating system and position us for future growth 
we have received the requisite regulatory approvals for the upgraded version of our legacy operating system software 
we have also received approvals for cpu nxt  our new operating system and gaming platform that supports all of our video and poker based products  from all north american regulators and most international regulators  beginning with our first regulatory approval for this platform in september we continue to work to incorporate new technologies into our software and platforms in anticipation of evolving customer preferences and future regulatory requirements 
leveraging our product development expertise to introduce innovative new games we have almost years of experience developing fun  humorous and exciting games in a variety of industries 
over the past three years  we have enhanced our game development efforts by adding key management  design personnel and software engineers to our product development group 
we have renovated our facilities and organized our game development team into a studio format to help promote innovation while maintaining a focused development approach in an effort to maximize the entertainment value of our products 
we recently realigned and streamlined responsibilities and consolidated several duplicate functions within product development and engineering 
we believe that our proven game development capabilities  combined with the additional functionalities and enhanced features of our new gaming platform  will enable us to increase our market share 
we continue to invest in content and innovation through the internal development and external licensing of important intellectual property rights 
these investments include new high profile  high impact brand names  such as world series of poker  which we licensed in april under the terms of the agreement  world series of poker branded games will initially be available solely at harrah s properties during a limited exclusivity period in each jurisdiction in which harrah s or its affiliates operate 
once the exclusivity timeframe in a jurisdiction expires  each game theme will be available for placement at other casinos in those markets 
the agreement with harrah s  which calls for the installation of a specified number of world series of poker branded gaming machines in harrah s casinos  is for a period of three years with an optional two year extension 
we expect to receive first approval in september for our first video poker games based on this high profile brand and the timing of the launch of this product will be determined by harrah s 
offering our new bluebird cabinets we have received approvals of our new bluebird cabinets from all north american regulators and most international regulators  beginning with our first regulatory approval of this new cabinet in november the bluebird cabinet is used for our video  mechanical reel spinning  poker and wide area and local area progressive products 
bluebird cabinets incorporate features such as an ergonomically engineered design  inch digital  high resolution flat screen monitors for the video version of the product  sound systems by bose corporation bose and simultaneous coin in coin out and cashless capabilities 
at the american gaming summit in january  industry experts selected the bluebird cabinet as one of the top three most innovative new gaming products 
expanding the breadth of our product offerings we have expanded our product lines to be able to fully serve casino operators gaming machine requirements 
our former product line focused primarily on the multi coin  multi line video based market sector 
our new product offerings also include mechanical reel spinning gaming machines we introduced our first new mechanical reel spinning gaming machines in the spring of as part of our launch of our wide area progressive jackpot system 
our first shipment of a for sale mechanical reel spinning gaming machine occurred in september we sold  mechanical reel gaming machines in fiscal we believe the mechanical reel spinning gaming machine market is an attractive opportunity  as it represents the largest portion of the global installed base of gaming machines 
video poker games we introduced our first video poker game on our new cpu nxt operating system in july we introduced one additional video poker game in fiscal the video poker games are offered as a cpu nxt conversion kit to our legacy gaming machine or in a new bluebird cabinet 
we expect that the launch of new world series of poker branded poker games will enhance our market share growth opportunities in this segment of the casino floor 
wide area and local area progressive systems by may  we received all of the regulatory approvals needed to operate our proprietary wide area progressive system and the first two games in nevada and native american casinos and introduced our first proprietary wide area progressive jackpot to our customers

in fiscal  we began offering local area progressive jackpots 
we believe demand will increase for games linked to our wide area and local area progressive jackpot systems 
we expect to introduce eighteen games on four proprietary local area and wide area progressive systems in fiscal  including powerball 
maximizing the potential of our participation games and exclusive licenses of popular brands as the exclusive licensee of the monopoly brand for use with gaming machines  we have converted a popular board game brand into a successful line of superior earning gaming machines 
we have also licensed additional brands and now have six series of participation game themes with an aggregate installed base of  participation games as of june   including our wap participation games 
we introduced a new branded series  men in black in late june and in early fiscal  we began offering our customers a new dual screen series of gaming machines 
the name recognition and creative game design of our branded products have allowed us to lease them to casino operators as participation games  generating a high margin recurring revenue stream for ourselves  as well as the casinos 
we continue to pursue new licensed brands and additional themes based on the guidance of focus group testing of casino patrons 
continuing our expansion into international markets we are authorized to conduct business in over foreign gaming jurisdictions 
revenues from our foreign customers were  or million of fiscal consolidated revenues compared to or million of fiscal consolidated revenues 
we anticipate growth in foreign markets with the continued penetration of cpu nxt  bluebird  and the introduction of mechanical reel spinning gaming machines and video poker games and additional game titles 
to enhance our focus on foreign markets  we appointed one of our senior executives as managing director of international operations in fiscal we currently have offices in australia  south africa  spain and  in fiscal  we opened an office in the united kingdom 
this new office houses our second internationally focused game development studio and  beginning in fiscal  will also include sales and distribution functions 
the united kingdom continues in its efforts to modify its gaming legislation  which we believe will turn into revenue opportunities in calendar we also view macau and russia as two markets with high growth potential 
we have been an active supplier to the russian market for the past three years  and in may  we launched the first bluebird gaming machines there 
in january  we amended our agreement with our russian distributor to extend the term through and increase their minimum annual commitment to  new gaming machines

products we offer video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines and vlts incorporating highly entertaining game themes and innovative gaming features

the bluebird cabinet supports both video and mechanical reel games and is easier and faster to service than our legacy cabinets  with of the internal components being interchangeable between upright and slant models 
our games integrate secondary bonus rounds as additions to the primary game to create a game within a game for more exciting and interactive play 
if players achieve various milestones in the primary game  they move on to play a secondary game without additional wagering for additional bonuses 
the secondary game gives the player a sense of investment in the game 
the player is encouraged to continue wagering on the primary game in the hope of being awarded a secondary bonus game 
the player can win in both the primary game and the secondary game 
in our secondary bonus games  the player has various choices to make regarding the bonus features 
for example  in some games the player can select from a variety of tokens or characters to obtain or reveal the bonus

in fiscal  we introduced puzzle pays  a second series of non linked participation games  based on popular licensed puzzle game themes 
the first game in the puzzle pays series was jumble  based on the popular scrambled word game appearing in newspapers nationwide 
two additional puzzle pays gaming machines followed bee bucks  the sequel to jumble  and a scrabble themed game

we are continually developing new games in order to refresh the installed base of our gaming machines and implementing new technologies and functionality to enhance player entertainment 
our gaming machines and games are usually designed and programmed by our internal engineering staff and game design studios 
our game design teams operate in a studio environment that encourages creativity  productivity and cooperation among design teams 
each of our eight studios works concurrently on multiple games and is staffed with software developers  graphic artists  mathematicians and game developers 
in some cases  we may outsource testing and graphic design functions to independent designers under contract to us

sales and marketing we are authorized to sell or lease our gaming machines to casinos in tribal jurisdictions and other gaming jurisdictions worldwide 
see government regulation general below 
in most gaming jurisdictions  we sell our gaming machines directly  rather than through the use of distributors  which we believe allows us to provide superior customer service and enhances profitability 
in some instances  our gaming machines are installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the customers 
in addition  we offer some of our most popular game themes on a participation or lease basis 
see company overview above 
we sell or lease vlts  depending on the jurisdictions where they are placed

in addition  successful competition in this market is also based upon engineering innovation and reliability  mechanical reliability  brand recognition  marketing and customer support  and competitive prices and lease terms 
we estimate that about companies in the world manufacture gaming machines and vlts for legalized gaming markets 
of these companies  we believe that international game technology igt  alliance gaming  aristocrat technologies  atronic casino technology  g tech holdings and wms control a majority of this worldwide market 
our competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to a few large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the larger competitors  particularly igt  have an advantage in being able to spend greater amounts than us to develop new technologies  games and features that are attractive to players and customers 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed  sell or otherwise provide to customers security  centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow casino operators to accumulate slot accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming machines 
we do not currently offer these systems 
several of our competitors pooled their intellectual property patents that provide cashless gaming alternatives  specifically ticket in ticket out technology so that when a casino patron cashes out from a gaming machine they may receive a printed ticket instead of coins 
we license this technology from these competitors and pass through the license fee to our customers 
in the video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machine market  we compete with market leader igt  as well as aristocrat technologies  alliance gaming  atronic casino technology  progressive gaming  konami  franco and unidesa 
in the vlt market  we compete primarily with igt  g tech holdings and scientific games 
manufacturing we manufacture all of our gaming machines at our facility in waukegan  illinois

we made improvements in sourcing and supply management  in inventory and warehouse management  and effected changes to our manufacturing processes 
we implemented a new sales operations group that worked to ensure we produced the quarterly output ratably throughout the quarter  thereby eliminating the quarter end compression in manufacturing that elevated costs in the first half of fiscal the changes we made within the manufacturing organization structure and the revised processes we implemented helped increase operational efficiencies 
we expect  with further operating efficiency improvements  to level load the shipment of new gaming machines each quarter 
we also have ongoing manufacturing initiatives  such as enhanced strategic sourcing and supplier management  value engineering the product and designing product for both ease of manufacturability and installation  that we expect will help improve gross margins in future quarters

each gaming machine must comply with the individual jurisdiction s regulations 
some jurisdictions require the licensing of gaming machine operators and manufacturers 
we manufacture and supply gaming equipment to various international markets including asia  australia  canada  europe  south america and south africa 
we have the required licenses to manufacture and distribute our products in the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
seasonality sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the winter and spring and slowest in the summer months 
in addition  quarterly revenues and net income may increase when we receive a larger number of approvals for new games from regulators than in other quarters  when a game or platform that achieves significant player appeal is introduced or if gaming is permitted in a significant new jurisdiction 
in addition  as further technology advancements become available for the gaming industry  replacement or conversion of gaming machines will be impacted once any such advanced technology is approved by regulators 
employees at september   we employed approximately  persons domestically and abroad 
approximately of our employees were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers the ibew at that date 
we have a collective bargaining agreement with the ibew related to our waukegan  illinois manufacturing facility  which expires on june  we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
risk factors the most significant factors that make an investment in our common stock risky or speculative are discussed below 
these factors may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or may adversely affect our operating results or the value of our common stock 
our gaming machine business is heavily regulated  and we must obtain and maintain our gaming licenses and regulatory approvals to continue to operate our business and sell our products 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulations and taxes 
the governments of the various gaming jurisdictions amend these regulations from time to time 
virtually all of these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of qualification  including evidence of financial stability  and other forms of approval for manufacturers and distributors of gaming machines and for their officers  directors  major security holders and key personnel 
the gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate any individual who has a material relationship with us and any security holder to determine whether the individual or security holder is acceptable to those gaming authorities 
any security holder investigated by the gaming authorities must pay the costs of the investigation 
each of our games and gaming machine hardware and software must be approved in each jurisdiction in which it is placed  and we cannot assure you that a particular game or hardware or software will be approved in any jurisdiction 
licenses  approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
the revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction for our games  hardware or software means that we cannot sell our products in that jurisdiction  and could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions 
if we fail to seek or do not receive a necessary registration  license  approval or finding of suitability  we may be prohibited from selling our games or gaming machines for use in the jurisdiction 
some jurisdictions require gaming manufacturers to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions  such as business combinations  reorganizations  stock offerings and repurchases 
obtaining licenses and approvals can be time consuming and costly 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary registrations  licenses  permits  approvals or findings of suitability in a timely manner  or at all 
similarly  we cannot assure you that our current registrations  licenses  approvals or findings of suitability will not be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
our profitability depends heavily on recurring revenue from gaming operations  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
approximately million  or  of our revenues for fiscal  and million  or  of our revenues in fiscal  were derived from gaming operations 
in addition  for fiscal  our gross margin on gaming operations was while our gross margin on product sales was 
for fiscal  our gross margin on gaming operations was  while our gross margin on product sales was 
therefore  our level of revenue from gaming operations has a significant effect on our profitability 
participation games are replaced by casino operators if the gaming machines do not meet and sustain revenue and net win expectations 
therefore  these gaming machines are particularly susceptible to pressure from competitors  declining popularity  changes in economic conditions and increased taxation and are at risk of replacement by the casinos  ending our recurring revenues from these machines 
we cannot assure you that our participation games will continue to meet the casinos revenue and net win requirements 
historically  we depreciated our legacy participation gaming machines and top boxes over a two year useful life to a small salvage value 
we introduced our new bluebird cabinet participation games in june we are depreciating the bluebird participation gaming machines over three years with a small salvage value  and the top boxes over one year to better match the reality of actual useful lives 
a material adverse impact could occur if the actual useful life of the participation gaming machines or top boxes is less than our estimate of the useful life  or if actual salvage value is less than the anticipated salvage value 
if we do not effectively operate our manufacturing processes and manage our inventory  and customers cancel orders or we have excess inventory  we may incur charges to earnings 
our manufacturing process is impacted by our ability to procure raw materials from our suppliers on a timely basis  effectively manage raw materials during the manufacturing process due to reliance on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers  accurately configure orders for gaming machines to customers specifications  maintain a balanced inventory  efficiently utilize our manufacturing capacity  manufacture a quality product with minimal defects and warranty issues  and deliver gaming machines to our customers on time 
if we are unable to fulfill customers orders timely or at the highest level of quality  and as a result  customers cancel orders  we may incur charges to earnings 
if we have excess or obsolete inventory which we are unable to sell  we may incur charges to earnings 
in fiscal  we recorded million of net inventory charges to reduce legacy inventory to net realizable value 
patent infringement claims could limit or affect our ability to market some of our gaming machines and subject us to liability 
our competitors have been granted patents covering numerous gaming machine features  bonusing techniques and related technologies 
if our products use processes or other subject matter that is claimed under these existing patents  or if other companies obtain patents claiming subject matter that we use  those companies may bring infringement actions against us 
we might then be forced to discontinue the affected products or be required to obtain licenses from the company holding the patent  if it is willing to give us a license  to develop  manufacture or market our products 
we also might then be limited in our ability to market new products 
we might also be found liable for treble damage claims relating to past use of the patented subject matter if the infringement is found to be willful 
software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and associated software could reduce our revenue  increase our costs  burden our engineering and marketing resources  involve us in litigation and adversely affect our gaming licenses 
our success depends on our ability to avoid  detect  replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and associated software 
our gaming machines and software have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past 
gaming machines may be replaced by casinos and other gaming machine operators if they do not perform according to expectations or may be shut down by regulators 
in the event of such issues with our gaming machines and software  substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues  which may delay our other projects 
in addition  regulators may not approve new games  which may substantially reduce our revenues 
our games are generally subject to rigorous testing  both internally and by various gaming jurisdictions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain software based gaming machines that are free from anomalies or manipulations and satisfy these tests 
our gaming machines have in the past and could in the future be susceptible to software anomalies and manipulation after the gaming machines or software has been widely distributed 
in addition  the occurrence of anomalies in  or fraudulent manipulation of  our gaming machines and software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses  or disciplinary action 
if we do not continue to introduce new games and gaming machines that achieve and maintain market acceptance  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected  and we will not recover our development costs 
our success also depends on continually developing and successfully marketing new games and gaming machines with strong and sustained player appeal 
a new game or gaming machine will be accepted by casino operators only if we can show that it is likely to produce more revenues to the operator than competitors products 
gaming machines can be installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the casinos 
if a new product does not achieve significant market acceptance  we may not recover our development and promotion costs 
we cannot assure you that the new products that we introduce will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance or that the acceptance will be sustained for any meaningful period 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current schedule of planned introductions 
if we do not continually adapt to the rapid development of new technologies  we will not be able to successfully compete in our industry 
the gaming machine business is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products using such technologies 
we must continually adapt our products to incorporate new technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop products using these new technologies or that we will be able to license such technologies if owned by others 
some of our competitors have advantages over us in their ability to finance technology development and in obtaining favorable placement in casinos  which may limit our revenues 
the gaming machine business is intensely competitive 
some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
in addition  new competitors may enter our key markets 
obtaining space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors is a competitive factor in our industry 
competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines than ours have an advantage in retaining the most space and best positions in casinos 
these competitors may also have the advantage of being able to convert their installed machines to newer models in order to maintain their share of casino floor space 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed and sell or otherwise provide to customers wide area progressive systems or centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow operators to accumulate accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming machines 
we began offering proprietary wide area progressive systems in late fiscal  but do not offer a centralized player tracking and accounting system 
if we do not obtain and retain licenses to use intellectual properties and licensors approvals of new products on a timely basis  our revenues will be adversely affected 
some of our most popular games and gaming machine features  including our monopoly branded games and ticket in  ticket out cashless gaming functionality  are based on trademarks and other intellectual properties licensed from third parties 
our future success may depend upon our ability to obtain and retain licenses for additional popular intellectual properties 
there is competition for these licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring or retaining additional intellectual property rights with significant commercial value on acceptable terms 
these intellectual properties are licensed for a fixed term and generally provide for minimum guaranteed royalties and other obligations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or renew the intellectual properties that we currently license 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to create games using the intellectual properties that will generate enough revenues for us to cover the minimum guaranteed royalties and other fixed costs 
in the event that we cannot renew our existing licenses  we may be required to discontinue the games bearing the licensed marks 
our intellectual property licenses generally require that we submit new products developed under these licenses to the licensor prior to release for approval  at their sole discretion  of our use of the licensed property 
rejection or delay in approval of a product design by a licensor could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to protect or retain our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain trademark protection for the names or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright protection and patent protection of our proprietary software and other game innovations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or obtain trademark or patent protection  that any trademark  copyright or issued patent will provide competitive advantages for us or that our intellectual properties will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information  but we cannot assure you that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or proprietary information will be honored 
despite various confidentiality agreements and other trade secret protections  our trade secrets and proprietary know how could become known to  or independently developed by  competitors 
if we do not realize the value of licensed intellectual property  licensed technology and royalty commitments  we may incur charges to earnings 
we have entered into several agreements to license intellectual property including licensing technologies related to alternative solutions as part of our technology improvement plan that  as of june   had a total potential commitment of million of which million has been expensed through june  resulting in million of remaining future expense 
if we determine that we may not realize the value of any of the commitments  we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these commitments in the period in which such determination is made 
we have also entered into several agreements to license intellectual property and pay royalties related to new game development  including three individual licenses which generated over of our consolidated revenue in fiscal if the revenue we expect to generate by these licenses were to substantially decline  we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these commitments in the period in which such decline in expected revenue occurred 
the gaming industry is sensitive to declines in the public acceptance of gaming that may lead to the passage of laws to significantly increase gaming taxes or outlaw gaming in affected jurisdictions 
the gaming industry can be affected by public opinion of gaming 
in the event that there is a decline in public acceptance of gaming  either through unfavorable legislation affecting the introduction of gaming into emerging markets  or through legislative and regulatory changes  including tax increases  in existing gaming markets  our ability to continue to sell and lease our games in those markets and jurisdictions would be adversely affected 
recent tax structure changes and rate increases in two jurisdictions have made gaming in general  and specifically participation games  less profitable in those jurisdictions 
we cannot assure you that public opinion will continue to support legalized gaming 
we face risks associated with doing business in foreign markets related to political and economic instability and related foreign currency fluctuations 
we seek to grow through increasing our presence in foreign markets 
potential political and economic instability in foreign markets may adversely affect our ability to enter into or continue to do business in these markets 
unstable governments and changes in current legislation may affect the gaming market with respect to gaming regulation  taxation  and the legality of gaming in some markets 
in addition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers may further impede our success in foreign markets 
our business in foreign markets is subject to the risks customarily associated with such activities 
as of june   we had million of trade accounts and notes receivable from customers in countries outside of the united states  most of which are denominated in us dollars 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we cannot assure you that foreign markets will remain politically and economically stable enough to continue as a potential source of revenues and profit to us 
the use of our rights plan or blank check preferred stock would inhibit the acquisition of wms or have a dilutive effect on our stock 
rights plan 
under our rights plan  each share of our common stock has an accompanying right to purchase convertible preferred stock that permits each holder to purchase shares of our common stock at half price 
the rights become exercisable if any person or entity who at the time of the adoption of the rights plan did not own or more of our common stock subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors 
we can redeem the rights at 
per right  subject to specified conditions  at any time 
the rights expire in april our board of directors could use this agreement as an anti takeover device to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
the use of our rights plan may dilute our common stock 
blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of five million shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board has broad power  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors could use preferred stock to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
our board has no current plans  agreements or commitments to issue any shares of preferred stock 
the existence of the blank check preferred stock  however  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the substantial number of shares of common stock available for sale in the future could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have million authorized shares of common stock 
as of september   million shares were issued  including million shares held in treasury 
on that date  we also had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock issuable at an average exercise price of per share and outstanding warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock issuable at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  we have granted million shares of restricted stock and million of performance contingent restricted units 
if all of our issued and outstanding stock options  warrants  restricted stock and performance contingent restricted units were exercised as of that date  million shares of our common stock would be outstanding 
if the holders of our convertible subordinated notes converted all of the notes  million additional shares of our common stock would be issued 
if all of the notes were converted to common stock and all of the outstanding options  warrants  restricted stock and performance contingent restricted units were exercised  million shares would still be available for issuance 
our board of directors has broad discretion to issue authorized but unissued shares  including discretion to issue shares in compensatory and acquisition transactions 
in addition  if we seek financing through the sale of our securities  our then current stockholders may suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our common stock 
the future issuance  or even the potential issuance  of shares at a price below the then current market price may have a depressive effect on the future market price of our common stock 
we are subject to general market and economic business risks 
during the normal course of our business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest and currency rate movements  collectibility of accounts and notes receivable  and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
we constantly assess these risks and have established policies and practices designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
we are dependent on certain key personnel 
our success will be dependent  to a significant extent  on the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of such executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations 
customer financing is becoming an increasing prevalent component of the sales process and therefore increases business risk of non payment 
we believe that customer financing terms and leasing have become increasingly important competitive factors for our business 
competitive conditions sometimes require us to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets  which delays our receipt of cash and can negatively impact our ability to enforce the company s rights upon default if the customer is from a foreign country 
while such equipment normally collateralizes these financings  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to the financial condition of our customers than had historically been the case 
failures or delays in the continuing implementation of our enterprise resource planning  or erp system  could disrupt operations and increase costs 
we continue to work through several implementation phases of our company wide erp solution for our computer system procedures and controls  any failures  difficulties or significant delays in implementing or maintaining our computer information systems could result in material adverse consequences to our business  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in costs 
sumner redstone owns or controls of our outstanding common stock  and he has been disposing of our stock and may dispose of all or a portion of his remaining stock ownership at any time  which could cause our stock price to decrease 
sumner redstone beneficially owns million shares  or  of our common stock  as reported in a form  filed by mr 
redstone with the sec on august  during june and july of  mr 
redstone reported that he entered into five forward transactions under which he would sell million shares of our common stock in multiple traunches which began settling in march and will end in october mr 
redstone has reported that through september  he has sold million shares under these forward transactions 
if the balance of the remaining forward transactions are completed it will reduce his ownership to approximately of our outstanding common stock by october mr 
redstone could sell any or all of his remaining shares at any time on the open market or to a person who wishes to acquire control of wms 
such a sale may require prior regulatory approval 
we cannot assure you that any such person would agree with our strategy and business goals described in this report 
sales by mr 
redstone of a large number of shares would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in august  we executed a five year extension through august of a voting trust agreement  which governs the voting rights of all shares of our common stock beneficially owned by mr 
redstone 
item properties 
we believe that the following facilities are suitable to our business and adequate for our current and near term needs 
we own substantially all of the machinery  equipment  tools and dies  furnishings and fixtures used in our businesses  all of which are adequate for the purposes intended 
in addition to the facilities described below  we also maintain leased space in major gaming jurisdictions worldwide including las vegas and reno  nevada  atlantic city  new jersey  gulfport  mississippi  kansas city  missouri  barcelona  spain  guateng  south africa  london  england  and ultimo  australia  to support game development  sales efforts  product delivery and field service operations in those areas 
manufacturing facility corporate headquarters our manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters is located in waukegan  illinois where we own a facility of more than  square feet to house our manufacturing and corporate administrative personnel 
this facility is our sole worldwide production facility 
our waukegan  illinois facility was built in and expanded and improved in it also includes warehouse space 
we have plans to expand our waukegan facility beginning in fiscal to ensure it is adequate in capacity and condition to satisfy our future growth requirements 
the expansion of our waukegan facility will add more than  square feet and is anticipated to cost between million and million 
chicago technology campus our engineering and game development headquarters is located in chicago  illinois  where we own a facility of more than  square feet to house our engineering and game development personnel 
our chicago facility has been renovated into a research and development center to accommodate the growth of our engineering and game development staff 
this facility supports engineering and game development for all north american markets and certain international markets 
we recently purchased a parcel of land in chicago near our technology campus and intend to create an additional  square feet of office space near our facility beginning in fiscal hurricane damage in late august a devastating hurricane hit the gulf coast of mississippi and louisiana causing substantial damage to the gulfport and biloxi  mississippi area  as well as new orleans  louisiana 
this is a very dynamic situation and our concerns were first to determine the safety of our employees and their families  second to secure our gulfport facility and third to execute our recovery plan for the recommencement of full operations 
our gulfport regional sales and distribution facility services both the states of mississippi and louisiana 
initial indications are that the building is structurally sound  although the building did sustain some damage which we need to further assess 
we have secured the facility to the best of our ability given the circumstances 
this facility monitors our mississippi wap operation and needs both power and telephone service to be restored in order to operate 
we are working with local authorities to determine the timeframe when such services may be restored  but restoration of these services could take several months 
we are also exploring alternatives for operating the mississippi wap 
we carry property insurance and business interruption insurance and are actively working with our insurance carriers on assessing our losses 
the business interruption insurance covers a period of up to days after we re open our gulfport facility 
the insurance company claim assessors need to inspect our premises and the area in general as the next step in the insurance claim process  and the entire claim process is expected to take an extended period of time 
item legal proceedings 
on october   la societe de loteries du quebec loto quebec filed claims against us and video lottery consultants inc  a subsidiary of igt vlc in the superior court of the province of quebec  quebec city district 
the pleadings allege that loto quebec would be entitled to be indemnified by the manufacturers of loto quebec s vlts  specifically wms and vlc  if the class action plaintiffs  described below  are successful in the pending class action lawsuit against loto quebec 
we are currently proceeding with discovery  and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the allegations

our common stock  par value  trades publicly on the new york stock exchange under the symbol wms 
the following table shows the high and low sale prices of our common stock for the two most recent fiscal years  as reported on the nyse high low fiscal year ended june  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year ended june  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter on september   there were approximately holders of record of our common stock 
no cash dividends were declared or paid on our common stock during fiscal or the payment of future cash dividends will depend upon  among other things  our earnings  anticipated expansion and capital requirements and financial condition 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have agreed to make additional payments of interest on our convertible subordinated notes if we declare a cash dividend on our common stock 
the amount of the payments will be equal to the cash dividends that would be payable to the holders of the notes if the holders had converted their notes into shares of our common stock on the record date for the dividend 
however  no such payment will be made if the dividend that would otherwise trigger the payment causes an adjustment to the note conversion rate 
our loan agreement with lasalle bank requires that we maintain a minimum amount of tangible net worth and certain financial ratio covenants which could limit our ability to declare dividends or make any distribution to holders of any shares of capital stock  or redeem or otherwise acquire such shares of our company 
as of june   approximately million was available for such distributions under the most restrictive of these covenants 
on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock over the succeeding twelve months 
this authorization expired on august  without any common stock purchases 
equity compensation we currently have one equity compensation plan under which new grants may be made  the wms industries inc incentive plan the plan  which was approved by our stockholders on december  the plan consolidated shares available under our previous stock option plans into the new plan  although outstanding equity grants under the previous plans are still governed by those individual plans 
the plan permits us to grant a variety of equity based awards including options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock 
options may be granted as incentive stock options  designed to meet the requirements of section of the internal revenue code or they may be non qualified options that do not meet the requirements of that section 
the purpose of the plan is to encourage our employees  non employee directors  consultants and advisors to acquire an ownership interest in our common stock and to enable these individuals to realize benefits from an increase in the value of our common stock 
we believe that this benefit provides these individuals with greater incentive to work to improve our business and encourages their continued provision of services to us and  generally  promotes our interests and those of our stockholders 
the compensation committee of the board of directors determines which of the eligible directors  officers  employees  consultants and advisors receive equity awards  the terms  including any vesting periods or performance requirements of the awards  and the size of the awards 
the board of directors  however performs the functions of the compensation committee for purposes of granting awards under the plan to non employee directors  although either the board of directors or the compensation committee has the authority with respect to other aspects of non employee director awards 
stock options pursuant to the plan  the option price per share for each stock option is determined by the compensation committee and generally is not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date on which the option is granted 
the plan has a term of ten years  unless terminated earlier  and options granted under the plan have terms up to years 
in december  we paid and expensed million to our president and chief executive officer to compensate him for deferring a stock option grant from august for  shares of our common stock that he was entitled to under his employment agreement 
the payment was calculated as the difference between the stock price in august on the date the president and ceo agreed to the deferral and the stock price on the actual grant date in december in september  the board of directors approved a director emeritus program for existing directors who reach age or have served on the board of directors for at least years 
the emeritus program is being phased in to maintain continuity and avoid losing the benefit of valuable experience 
in december   fully vested five year stock options were issued to two directors emeritus upon their retirement from the board 
restricted stock grants upon the recommendation of our compensation committee  we have  on occasion  granted restricted stock to our employees  officers  directors or consultants to motivate them to devote their full energies to our success  to reward them for their services and to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders 
in june  our compensation committee approved the award of  restricted shares with a weighted average fair value at grant date of per share to certain executive officers of the company 
the grant was made in consideration of their time and efforts in the oversight of the implementation of our technology improvement plan

the restricted stock awards are not performance based and vest equally over a three year period ending in december in addition  on june   the board of directors approved the award of  shares of restricted stock  with a weighted average fair value at grant date of or million 
under these restricted grants  grantees are entitled to any cash dividends and to vote their shares  but may not sell or transfer their shares during the vesting period 
upon approval of the plan  the board of directors established a long term incentive plan to attract and retain executives  other key employees  non employee directors and key consultants of high quality as these personnel will be essential to our growth and success 
under the plan the participants  including the executive officers  receive an annual stock option grant and grant of equity based performance units 
on january   the board of directors approved the fiscal equity grants  including  stock based performance units under the plan to certain participants  including  shares to our executive officers 
the stock based performance units contain performance goals set by the board of directors based on our levels of total revenue and free cash flow over the thirty month period ending june  the number of shares of stock awarded to participants is dependent upon the achievement of the performance goals and the extent to which each goal is achieved or exceeded and can result in shares being issued up to of the targeted number of shares under each grant 
on june   the board of directors approved  equity based performance units for the fiscal grant under the plan  including  units to our executive officers 
the stock based performance units contain performance goals set by the board of directors based on the levels of our total revenue and free cash flow over the thirty six month period ending june  the number of shares of stock awarded to participants is dependent upon the achievement of the performance goals and on the extent to which each goal is achieved or exceeded and can result in shares being issued up to of the targeted number of shares under each grant 
on june   non management members of the board of directors were awarded an aggregate of  units of deferred stock under the plan coupled with an aggregate of  stock options 
the deferred stock units vest immediately and our common stock is issued upon the directors leaving the board 
grantees are not entitled to vote their units or to receive cash dividends  but they are entitled to receive make whole payments on any declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as used in this report on form k  the terms we  us  our  and wms mean wms industries inc  a delaware corporation  and its subsidiaries 
gaming operations  as used throughout this report  includes the gaming machines that we lease based upon any of the following payment methods a percentage of the net win of the gaming machines  fixed daily fees  or in the case of wide area progressive gaming machines  a percentage of the amount wagered  called coin in 
overview our historical product sales strength has been in the multi line  multi coin video product line  which  together with our vlt product  accounted for substantially all of our new product sales for the past three fiscal years 
an element of our strategy is to become a full service gaming machine provider to casinos by developing and obtaining regulatory approval for four additional product lines mechanical reel gaming machines  video poker games  wide area progressive wap jackpot systems  and local area progressive jackpot systems 
we believe these new product lines account for approximately of the typical casino slot floor and represent a significant market share growth opportunity for us 
in january  as a result of software anomalies that were present in our legacy operating system that ran our gaming machines  we began to execute a technology improvement plan to first stabilize and then modernize our operating system software 
customers were apprised of this technology improvement plan and our intention to introduce our new bluebird gaming cabinet and new cpu nxt computer circuit board and operating system that would provide features and functionality that our existing products lacked 
as a result  from january through november  our product sales revenues declined from levels experienced in fiscal and as we received regulatory approvals throughout fiscal for our new cpu nxt computer circuit board and operating system  new bluebird cabinet and new games from each of the six north american gaming labs  our product sales revenues increased and this continued in fiscal in fiscal  and  with all of the approvals in hand for all of our product lines  we expect to grow our market share with our new product lines mechanical reel  video poker  local area progressive jackpot systems and wide area progressive jackpot systems 
technology improvement plan in the first phase of this plan  we improved the stability of our operating system by introducing two upgrades  version for hopper based games and version for printer based games 
version has been approved by all six of the north american gaming labs  and we were required to and completed an upgrade of our hopper game operating system to version in four jurisdictions plus the casinos regulated by gaming laboratories international  inc gli 
other jurisdictions may require upgrades in the future 
we are making version available in other jurisdictions as an optional upgrade 
gli and nevada approved version  our printer upgrade version  in calendar nevada and gli are currently the only jurisdictions that have required all printer games be upgraded to version 
other jurisdictions may require upgrades in the future  and we have made version available in other approved jurisdictions as an optional upgrade 
the gli lab tests product for all of the native american casinos and the midwest riverboat casinos where in the aggregate we believe about of our legacy gaming machines are deployed 
we have completed the second phase of our technology improvement plan  which consisted of the development  approval and introduction of our new cpu nxt computer circuit board and operating system for video based games 
the commercial version of the cpu nxt operating system was approved by gli in september when we also received gli approval for nine game themes on this new system 
we subsequently received regulatory approvals for cpu nxt from the other five north american gaming labs 
in the third phase of the technology improvement plan  we are evaluating specifications and requirements for an even more advanced gaming system 
we continue to refine the design and specifications to incorporate additional features we desire for this platform and continue to allocate more resources to this longer term effort 
in june  we entered into a wide ranging technology transfer agreement with cyberscan technology inc d b a cyberview technology to acquire new technology capabilities 
cyberview designs and develops server based game download and gaming systems and related player stations and equipment

bluebird and cpu nxt commercialization for our video product line  our focus in the near term is to refresh the remainder of our legacy installed base of video gaming machines in casinos through either replacement with new bluebird video gaming machines or through cpu nxt upgrade kits and to recapture video market share that we lost during the period we developed the first two phases of our technology improvement plan 
we received the first approval from gli for the marketable version of the bluebird video cabinet at the end of november we have now received approvals for the bluebird video cabinet from the other five north american gaming labs 
each jurisdictional approval of the cpu nxt operating system has allowed us to submit new game themes designed for use with that system to the regulators for approval  which also enables us to sell and ship additional bluebird units and cpu nxt upgrade kits 
we now have the approvals from all six north american gaming labs for hardware peripheral options  such as alternative coin handling  printing and bill accepting equipment 
customer acceptance of bluebird gaming machines and our new game themes continues to be very favorable

through september   over  of these orders had been shipped  the remaining  of these open orders consist of approximately  new bluebird gaming machines and approximately  cpu nxt upgrade units  which we expect to ship over the next four quarters 
we expect order levels to continue at a strong pace as the bluebird gaming machines and new game themes are generating strong average daily revenues for casinos  and we have all necessary regulatory approvals 
we have over video for sale game themes approved in most gaming jurisdictions 
we also expect strength in game conversion revenues over the next several quarters  as operators decide to refresh their bluebird gaming machines with new video game themes and as we continue to deliver our cpu nxt upgrade kits and printer upgrades

recent developments in late august a devastating hurricane hit the gulf coast of mississippi and louisiana causing substantial damage to the gulfport and biloxi  mississippi area  as well as new orleans  louisiana 
this is a very dynamic situation and our concerns were first to determine the safety of our employees and their families  second to secure our gulfport facility and third to execute our recovery plan for the recommencement of full operations 
all of our employees are safe and we have established a fund to assist our employees impacted by the hurricane  and we made an initial  contribution to this fund 
we are also accepting employee contributions to this fund 
our gulfport regional sales and distribution facility services both the states of mississippi and louisiana 
initial indications are that the building is structurally sound  although the building did sustain some damage which we need to further assess 
we have secured the facility to the best of our ability given the circumstances 
this facility monitors our mississippi wap operation and needs both power and telephone service to be restored in order to operate 
we are working with local authorities to determine the timeframe when such services may be restored  but restoration of these services could take several months 
we are also exploring alternatives for operating the mississippi wap 
we carry property insurance and business interruption insurance and are actively working with our insurance carriers on assessing our losses 
the business interruption insurance covers a period of up to days after we re open our gulfport facility 
the insurance company claim assessors need to inspect our premises and the area in general as the next step in the insurance claim process  and the entire claim process is expected to take an extended period of time 
initial indications are that the casinos in the biloxi and gulfport areas will need to be rebuilt and will not open for a protracted period of time 
some casinos may decide not to rebuild 
casinos in new orleans may need major reconstruction and  given the devastation to the area  may be closed for months 
casinos outside of these areas may also need some restoration and some have not had electricity service restored  but others have reopened for business for the most part  although their business may be at lower than historical levels 
in fiscal  we sold just over  new gaming machines to casinos in the biloxi and gulfport areas and in new orleans and of our installed base of participation games or units were in these casinos when the hurricane struck 
an additional wap gaming machines in casinos throughout mississippi are currently impacted by the wap monitoring room being inoperable 
total revenues from casinos in the biloxi and gulfport areas and casinos in new orleans amounted to approximately million or of our total revenues in fiscal critical accounting policies revenue recognition the application of revenue recognition policies is critical due to the nature of product sales contracts we execute 
we record revenue on product sales  net of rebates  discounts and allowances  when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  the product is delivered and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when multiple product deliverables are included under a sales contract  we allocate revenue to each product based upon their respective fair values against the total contract value and defer revenue recognition on those deliverables where we have not met all requirements of revenue recognition 
gaming operations revenues under operating type lease agreements are estimated and recognized as earned when collectibility is reasonably assured 
non linked participation lease agreements are based on either a pre determined percentage of the daily net win of each gaming machine or a fixed daily rental fee 
wap revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of amounts wagered  called coin in  on each gaming machine and are recognized as earned when collectibility is reasonably assured 
under agreements with licensees who are generally located in geographic areas or operate in markets where we are not active  we are paid royalties based upon our licensees purchase or placement of gaming machines with our licensed themes  artwork and other intellectual property 
royalties are recorded as earned when the licensee purchases or places the game and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the application of this policy affects the level of our product sales and gaming operations revenue  cost of product sold  cost of gaming operations  accounts receivable  deferred revenue and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
income tax accounting we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes are provided for amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities based upon differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
at june   we had million of research and development tax credit carry forwards expiring from through  million of foreign tax credit carry forwards expiring from through  million of state net operating loss carry forwards expiring from through  million of federal net operating loss carry forwards expiring in and million of foreign net operating losses with unlimited carry forward 
at june   we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of the benefit of the million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet  including the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credit carry forwards 
accordingly  we only provided a minimal valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets 
in determining the level of required valuation allowance  we considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
however  additional valuation allowances could be recorded against these deferred tax assets and charged against income in future periods if our future estimates of amounts realizable are reduced or if the timing of such realization extends beyond our current expectations 
in december  the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards staff position provided that accounting for the tax deduction on qualified production expense arising from the enactment of the american jobs creation act should be treated as a special income tax deduction  rather than a reduction of the overall statutory federal tax rate 
we have maintained our deferred tax assets at the historical federal and state statutory rates 
the application of this policy affects the level of our tax expense  current income tax receivables and liabilities  and current and non current deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories we value inventory based on estimates of potentially excess and obsolete inventory after considering forecasted demand and forecasted average selling prices 
however  forecasts are subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
actual demand may differ from anticipated demand  and such differences may have a material effect on our financial statements 
demand for legacy parts inventory is subject to technical obsolescence 
inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand is written down to net realizable value 
in fiscal  we introduced our new bluebird cabinet and cpu nxt gaming platform  and this has accelerated the obsolescence of existing legacy product lines 
some customers traded in their legacy gaming machines when they purchased a new bluebird gaming machine 
we either sell these trade ins as is or renovate the legacy gaming machines before resale 
we also have legacy parts inventory which we use for renovating the trade in games  producing new legacy gaming machines under oem arrangements with multimedia games mgam  or selling such parts to casinos and others for our spare parts business 
an active market exists mostly outside of north america for used gaming machines 
in january  we relocated the refurbishment of used gaming machines to our las vegas facility to better focus on this business 
in fiscal  we sold  used gaming machines 
we continue to support our customers installed base of legacy gaming machines and continue to review our legacy inventories for impairment 
at june   our inventories included million of legacy product including million of legacy raw materials and million of new and used legacy finished goods 
this compares to a total of million at june  demand for bluebird product continues to exceed our expectations 
while this higher demand is a positive development for our long term growth  it has accelerated the transition from our legacy product line 
in response to this  we took steps to address the most challenging components of the legacy inventory including selling older model used gaming machines and used gaming machines configured with undesirable laminate colors  as well as selling back to suppliers excess quantities of certain legacy raw materials 
in fiscal  we recorded non cash  pre tax net inventory charges of million to reduce legacy inventory to net realizable value 
the application of this policy affects the level of our inventory and cost of product sales 
in fiscal and we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
participation gaming machine depreciation historically  we depreciated our legacy participation gaming machines over a two year useful life to a small salvage value and top boxes over a two year useful life 
we introduced our new bluebird cabinet participation games in june we are depreciating the bluebird participation gaming machines over three years with a small salvage value  and the top boxes over one year to better match the reality of actual useful lives 
a material adverse impact could occur if the actual useful life of the participation gaming machines or top boxes is less than what was used in estimating depreciation expense  or if actual salvage value is less than the anticipated salvage value 
the application of this policy affects the level of our gaming operations machines  accumulated depreciation on gaming operations machines and depreciation expense 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy  and the change in depreciable life for the bluebird product did not have a material impact on our financial statements in fiscal intellectual property valuation we license intellectual property from third parties that we use in some of our games and gaming machines 
in addition  we have licensed technologies from third parties 
as part of our contracts with the licensors  we typically provide a guaranteed minimum and prepayment of royalties and license fees  usually at the time the contract is signed  even though the product may not be introduced until months or years later 
we capitalize the prepaid royalty and license fees as other assets 
at june   minimum guaranteed royalty payments totaled million  including million of minimum commitments for licensed technology  of which million has been paid and the balance is payable over various periods up to five years 
in addition  the contracts provide for an additional million of contingent royalty payments based upon future events occurring 
total prepaid royalties at june  were million of which million is recorded as other current assets and million is recorded as other assets 
when products using the licensed intellectual property or technology begin to generate revenue  we begin amortization of the amount advanced 
in cases where the advance represents a paid up license  the advance is amortized based on the estimated life of the asset 
in those cases where the license agreement provides for a royalty to be earned by the licensor for each gaming machine sold or placed on a lease  the advance is amortized based on the royalty rates provided in the license agreement 
in both cases the amortization of the advances are included in cost of product sales if related to a product sale or cost of gaming operations if related to placement or lease of gaming operations machines 
to the extent that we determine that the products developed would not fully recover the guaranteed minimum amounts  we would record an immediate charge against earnings at the time of such determination 
in fiscal  we expensed million pre tax or million after tax related to an estimated impairment of the survivor intellectual property license  and we recorded a pre tax write down of approximately million or million after tax  to reduce the carrying value of survivor inventory to net realizable value 
in addition  in fiscal  we announced that we would allow our agreement with stargames corporation pty ltd 
for exclusive north american distributorship rights to their rapid roulette table gaming product to expire 
we encountered several significant obstacles in bringing this product to market  including regulatory  technical  and customer acceptance issues 
as a result of the expiration of the agreement  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million  or million after tax in fiscal to write down rapid roulette inventory to net realizable value and write off distribution rights assets 
the application of this policy affects the level of our current assets  non current assets  cost of product sales and cost of gaming operations 
in fiscal and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
licensed technology valuation as part of our technology improvement plan  as discussed above  we have pursued alternative strategies for each phase of our plan  including licensing technologies from third parties 
at june   our minimum guaranteed payments related to technology alternatives totaled million  of which million had been paid as advances and recorded as other assets in our balance sheet and million has been recognized as expense 
if we determine that we will not realize the value of the guaranteed commitment for a particular licensed technology alternative  we will record an immediate charge against earnings at the time of our determination  of up to million if all of the alternatives were to have no further value to us 
as a result of our successful implementation of upgrades to our legacy platform in  we determined that we no longer intended to use an alternative operating system  which was originally licensed  among other uses  to serve as a back up during the short term phase of the plan 
accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of million  or million after tax to write off this license agreement obligation 
the application of this policy affects the level of our non current assets  cost of product sales  cost of gaming operations  research and development expense and selling and general expense 
in fiscal and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
accrued liabilities we accrue expenses related to employee benefits  software anomalies  litigation and other contingencies based upon our best estimates of the costs that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
these estimates are updated monthly based on current information 
however  changes in estimates or actual expenses may exceed accrued amounts 
the application of this policy affects the level of our current liabilities  research and development expense and selling and general expense 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised fasb statement no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the provisions of this statement are effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after june  we expect to adopt this statement using the modified prospective transition method 
we currently estimate the quarterly impact of adopting this statement will be a decrease in net income per diluted share 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions 
the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
this statement is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement clarifies the accounting for some circumstances in which items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued a fasb staff position  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides a tax deduction on qualified production activities 
the fasb staff position provides that the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with fasb statement no 
we adopted fasb staff position in the quarter ended december  and the impact was not significant to the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued a fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fasb staff position introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria are met 
this position is effective upon issuance and the impact was not significant to the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements to fund our operations 
we utilize financing arrangements for operating leases of equipment and facilities  none of which are in excess of our current needs 
we also have minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property used in our gaming machines that are not recorded on our balance sheet 
typically  we are obligated to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the term of our license and to advance payment against those guarantees 
our obligations under these arrangements and under our convertible subordinated notes  at june   were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions operating leases royalty payments  excluding contingent payments non cancelable raw materials purchase orders convertible subordinated notes other  including guaranteed minimums in employment agreements total the total potential royalty commitments  including payments already made and those contingent upon future events  increased slightly from million at june  to million at june  due to new and amended brand licensing agreements 
potential royalty commitments could continue to increase in the future as we enter into new brand licensing agreements 
we do not have any special purpose entities for investment or the conduct of our operations 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments  although we have granted stock options  restricted stock  equity based performance units and deferred stock units to our employees  officers  directors and consultants and warrants to a licensor  and we have issued convertible subordinated notes 
liquidity and capital resources our use of capital is largely for working capital to support our revenue base 
therefore  in any given reporting period  the amount of cash consumed or generated by operations will primarily relate to the rate of sales increase or decrease  causing a corresponding change in working capital 
in periods when sales are increasing  the expanded working capital needs will be funded from available cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations  and  if necessary  proceeds from additional borrowings or additional equity offerings 
also  we will from time to time issue or retire borrowings or repurchase equity in an effort to maintain a cost effective capital structure consistent with our anticipated capital requirements 
capital commitments are made for property  plant and equipment and gaming operations equipment  other commitments made relate primarily to licensing or technology agreements to obtain access to third party brands or technologies that we have not developed internally 
liquidity as of increase decrease june  june  in millions total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments total current assets total assets total current liabilities long term debt stockholders equity net working capital our sources of liquidity for the year ended june  were existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  our net income of million plus million of depreciation and amortization  million of deferred income taxes and other non cash expenses of million  including a receivables provision  and proceeds from stock option exercises of million  and million of related tax benefits 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at june   inclusive of million of restricted cash  will be adequate to fund our anticipated level of expenses  capital expenditures  cash to be invested in gaming operations machines  and the levels of inventories and receivables required in the operation of our business 
for the next twelve months  we expect positive cash flow from operations and we do not expect to borrow any money under our revolving credit line 
in fiscal  and  we expect cash flow from operations to increase significantly as we seek to increase our market share in our new product lines mechanical reel  poker and wide area progressive systems 
we do not believe we will need to raise additional capital in the short term or long term for our existing operations  however we will assess market opportunities as they arise 
we renegotiated our unused line of credit for million under a revolving credit agreement for a new one year term to may  we did not borrow any amounts on our line of credit during fiscal  or our short term investments primarily consist of auction market preferred stocks stated at cost  which approximates market value 
these investments generally have no fixed maturity date but most have dividend reset dates every days or longer 
these investments can be liquidated under an auction process on the dividend reset dates subject to a sufficient number of bids being submitted 
our policy is to invest cash with issuers that have high credit ratings and to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
during fiscal  we liquidated all but million of our short term investments 
during fiscal  our net working capital increased primarily due to continued investment in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by increases in accounts payable 
accounts and notes receivable increased by million due to higher new unit sales levels during fiscal inventory at june   increased by million due to higher levels of bluebird raw materials and finished goods as we experienced an increasing volume of business and growth in the installed base of gaming operations machines 
royalty advances increased by million due to new technology and brand license agreements we entered into or amended during fiscal income tax receivables decreased by million primarily due to receipt of prior year tax refunds 
current liabilities increased by million due to higher accounts payable reflecting higher inventory levels  higher royalty accruals and higher compensation related accruals 
we have not experienced significant bad debt expense in any of the periods presented 
we expect to continue to invest in working capital through fiscal and due to our operating losses in fiscal and  we have recorded million and million of current income tax receivables on our balance sheets as of june  and june   respectively 
this tax receivable is based on our ability to receive refunds of tax payments made in fiscal  and  including payments made under the federal alternative minimum tax system 
we also have million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of june   an increase of million from june  these assets represent taxable temporary differences expected to reverse in future years  and tax credits and remaining tax net operating losses generated in fiscal and that can be claimed on future income tax returns to reduce current tax due in those years 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
we made this determination primarily based on our projection of future taxable income which we believe will be sufficient to allow us to realize these deferred tax assets 
on this basis  we have provided a minimal valuation allowance related to realizability of such assets as of june  however  additional valuation allowances could be recorded against these deferred tax assets and charged against income in future periods if our future estimates of amounts realizable are reduced or if the timing of such realization extends beyond our current expectations 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures at june  we expect to spend to million in fiscal on expanding our manufacturing facility in waukegan  illinois 
we utilize financing arrangements for operating leases at regional office facilities and for some equipment 
we have royalty commitments for brand and technology licenses that are not recorded in our balance sheet 
our total potential royalty commitments  including payments of million contingent upon future events  increased from million at june  to million at june   of which million has been paid 
please refer to the table under off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations above and note to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes bearing interest at maturing on july  in july  we issued an additional million of convertible subordinated notes under identical terms to cover an over allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the notes 
the notes are convertible at any time into an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are not callable 
we pay interest on the notes semi annually on january and july of each year aggregating million annually  which commenced on january  conversion of the convertible subordinated notes into shares of common stock would reduce our annual interest expense 
the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes to common stock is dependent on individual holders choices to convert  which is dependent on the spread of the market price of our stock above the conversion strike price of per share 
none of the holders have converted any of their convertible subordinated notes into our common stock 
capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods shown in millions of dollars for the fiscal year ended june  increase decrease cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash used by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to cash used of million for fiscal the million current year s decrease in cash used by operating activities relative to the comparable prior year was due to a million increase in net income and a million increase in non cash expenses  partially offset by a million increase in cash invested in operating assets and liabilities due to growth of our business 
depreciation expense totaled million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal we anticipate cash to be provided by operations over the next twelve months  due to anticipated higher revenues from increased new unit sales  higher gaming operations revenues and higher depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by higher research and development expenses related to the ongoing execution of our technology improvement plan  product approval costs  product line expansion costs and increased game offerings  as well as higher selling and administrative costs due to higher revenues 
in addition  we expect in fiscal and fiscal that our cash invested in operating assets and liabilities will not continue to increase at the rate experienced in fiscal components of the million increase and million increase in net investment in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal and  respectively  are as follows in millions of dollars for the year ended june  increase decrease changes in operating assets and liabilities decrease increase in operating assets restricted cash accounts and notes receivable income tax receivable raw material and finished goods inventories other current assets all other operating assets increase in operating liabilities current liabilities net decrease increase in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal  the million increase in accounts and notes receivable reflects an increasing trend in new unit sales  with slightly extended payment terms and higher gaming operations revenues  while inventories increased million as we experienced an increased volume of business and growth in the installed base of gaming operations machines 
the decrease in income tax receivable was primarily due to the collection of income tax refunds 
the increase in other current assets is primarily due to a million increase in the current portion of royalty advances for new technology and brand license agreements entered into or amended during fiscal  a million increase in general prepaid expenses and deposits and a million increase in additional current deferred tax assets 
the increase of current liabilities is due to higher accounts payable reflecting higher inventory levels  higher royalty accruals and higher compensation related accruals 
for fiscal  the million increase in accounts and notes receivable reflects an increasing trend in new unit sales  and slightly extended payment terms  while inventories increased million as we prepared for an increased volume of business and growth in the installed base of gaming operations machines 
the decrease in income tax receivable was primarily due to receipt of prior year tax refunds 
the increase in other current assets is primarily due to a million increase in the current portion of royalty advances for new technology and brand license agreements entered into or amended during fiscal and million of additional current deferred tax assets 
the increase of current liabilities is due to higher accounts payable reflecting higher inventory levels  partially offset by our payment to midway of a million tax advance 
cash used by investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively

in fiscal  revenues from parts  used games  conversions and oem revenues increased compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase in cpu nxt upgrade kits sold during fiscal as we received approvals to sell our new games and conversion kits with the cpu nxt operating system 
the average selling price of new units was  in fiscal the average sales price per new unit increased as higher priced new bluebird units represented a greater proportion of new unit sales during fiscal and we benefited from new premium priced product enhancement features such as marquees and alternative top box shapes and an expanded number of dual screen games that command premium pricing

in fiscal  we expanded our placement of wap games and we continued to refresh the installed base of legacy participation games with our new bluebird gaming machines 
the increase in the average installed base of participation gaming machines was due to new games offered on our new bluebird gaming cabinet 
the transition of the installed base of legacy gaming machines  which did not support the dual port cashless gaming technology that many customers require  to new games in bluebird cabinets and the natural evolution of our older participation series also impacted the installed base and average revenue per day 
the installed base grew  units to  units at june  from june   as we introduced new wap and non linked participation games in the bluebird cabinet 
the success of these new games is accelerating our transition from games in legacy cabinets to new games in bluebird cabinets as we have installed  new games in bluebird cabinets and only  participation games remain in legacy cabinets 
average revenues per day increased due to wap gaming machines  which earn net revenue at about twice the average of our non linked games  becoming a higher percentage of our installed base and as we replaced our legacy participation games with new games in bluebird cabinets 
we expect growth in our installed base of participation games and average revenue per day of gaming operations in future quarters as wap games become a higher percentage of our installed base and we install higher earning non linked participation games in our new bluebird cabinet 
at june   wap games represented over of our installed base of participation games and we expect that percentage to increase in fiscal as we offer new wap games

the gross profit margin on gaming operations decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year  reflecting the lower margins on our wide area progressive games due to the required funding of the progressive jackpot and higher royalties payable to licensors  partially offset by higher royalties received from licensees

the increased costs were due to million of separation costs related to a reduction in work force  higher regulatory approval costs incurred for the final approvals for cpu nxt and bluebird  for a greater number of new game themes and for the final legacy operating system upgrade in gli territories  plus headcount increases to fully staff our international game development studios and increased staff for the long term portion of the technology improvement plan 
with higher regulatory approval costs and a greater number of product lines and game theme offerings planned throughout fiscal  we expect quarterly research and development expenses to exceed levels in the comparable prior year quarters 
during fiscal  we introduced new games for sale and new participation games  and in fiscal  we introduced new games for sale and new participation games 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these cost increases resulted from million of separation costs related to a reduction in work force  higher commissions based on substantially higher revenues  additional headcount  overtime and temporary contract labor for game installs  participation placements and in certain administrative areas due to increased demand and the timing of shipments  additional trade show and marketing costs to continue to support the simultaneous launch of three new product lines and higher equity compensation costs 
we continue to expect selling and administrative expenses in fiscal and to exceed those in comparable prior years quarters 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  as the level of investment in participation gaming machines for gaming operations increased from fiscal to million with the installation of  new bluebird cabinets during fiscal we expect that the level of investment in gaming operations equipment will continue  but at declining levels for the next two fiscal years due to the ongoing placement of new participation game themes  including wap game themes  in our new bluebird cabinet

in fiscal  revenues from parts  used games  conversions and oem revenues increased compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase of  units sold under oem agreements in the current fiscal year  and higher levels of game conversion revenues as we received approvals to sell our new games and conversion kits with the cpu nxt operating system over the last six months of fiscal the average sales price per new unit increased as higher priced bluebird units more than offset lower priced video lottery terminal sales during fiscal the average selling price of bluebird units was  in fiscal the average installed base of participation gaming machines decreased to  units in fiscal from  units in fiscal  while the net revenue per day increased by per day from the prior fiscal year to per day as we continued to refresh the installed base with our new games 
the installed base declined from fiscal due to the fact that our legacy operating system does not support key features and functionality that casino operators demanded such as cashless gaming options  multi denomination and tokenization  and the performance of certain of our older participation series had decreased 
in january  the last survivor themed wide area progressive jackpot was terminated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  primarily associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge either of these risks  or utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk from our convertible subordinated notes and short term line of credit 
the notes are at a fixed rate and the short term line of credit is at a variable rate 
as of june   we had million of convertible fixed rate debt with an interest rate of and a fair value of million 
using a discounted cash flow model  and assuming no change in the market price of our common stock into which the debt is convertible  we currently estimate that a basis point change in the prevailing market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million  but would not be material to our cash flows or future results of operations 
however  the fair value of our convertible fixed rate debt is more significantly dependent on the market price of our common stock into which it can be converted 
in may  we renewed a million day revolving line of credit to provide us with additional liquidity to meet our short term financing needs 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at a certain percentage above the agent s prime rate 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of june  foreign currency risk we have subsidiaries in spain  canada  south africa  united kingdom and australia for distribution and development operations 
these subsidiaries transact business in their respective foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we estimate that a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar for fiscal would have resulted in a pretax loss or gain of about million 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
such translation resulted in unrealized losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  foreign governments could impose restrictions on currency movements that might make it costly or impossible to repatriate earnings to the us
