while the average offshore revenue per seat is less  the operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable or higher than those in the united states 
however  our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce in offshore markets 
the increase in emea s revenue of million  or  for was primarily related to the strengthening euro  which positively impacted revenues for by approximately million compared to the euro in excluding this foreign currency benefit  emea s revenues would have increased million compared with last year reflecting an improvement in certain customer call volumes and higher incentive payments related to quality operating performance

direct salaries and related costs direct salaries and related costs decreased million or to million for  from million in excluding the negative foreign currency impact of million related to the strengthening euro in compared to the euro in  direct salaries and related costs decreased million compared with last year 
this decrease was due to lower direct and indirect salaries and related benefits primarily attributable to an overall reduction in us customer call volumes 
this decrease was offset by higher telephone costs related to transporting calls offshore  higher staffing and training costs associated with the ramp up offshore and certain duplicative costs as we simultaneously ramped down us customer contact management centers  termination costs related to the consolidation of two european customer contact management centers and higher claim costs associated with our automotive program in canada related to higher fuel costs and the severe canada winter

this decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in depreciation expense of million related to the expiration of two technology client contracts  lower insurance costs  technology related costs and bad debts 
this decrease was partially offset by higher compliance costs of million related to the sarbanes oxley act  compensation costs of million related to the former chairman s retirement and lease and utilities costs

provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million was based upon pre tax book income of million  compared to the provision for income taxes of million based upon a pre tax book income of million 
the million change was primarily attributable to the million change in pre tax book income 

table of contents the effective tax rate was for and for this decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from a shift in our mix of earnings within tax jurisdictions and the related effects of permanent differences  state income taxes and foreign income tax rate differentials including tax holiday jurisdictions offset by a requisite valuation allowance for the year to date united states tax loss benefit provided during the second  third and fourth quarters of partially reduced by the reversal of certain specific tax contingency reserves 
net income loss as a result of the foregoing  we reported income from operations for of million  an increase of million from this increase was principally attributable to an million decrease in direct salaries and related costs  a million increase in net gain on disposal of property and equipment and a million net gain on insurance settlement offset by a million decrease in revenues  a million increase in general and administrative costs  a million increase in impairment of long lived assets and a million decrease in reversals of restructuring and other charges  as previously discussed 
the million increase in income from operations and an increase in other income of million were offset by a million higher tax provision  resulting in net income of million for  an increase of million compared to compared to revenues during  we recorded consolidated revenues of million  an increase of million or from million of consolidated revenues for on a geographic segmentation basis  revenues from the americas region  including the united states  canada  latin america  india and the asia pacific rim  represented  or million for compared to  or million for revenues from the emea region  including europe  the middle east and africa  represented  or million for compared to or million for the increase in americas revenue of million  or  for was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our offshore operations  including latin america  india and the asia pacific rim  resulting from the continued acceleration in demand for a lower cost customer contact management solution as well as further diversification into new vertical markets 
these offshore operations represented of consolidated revenues for compared to for we expect this trend of generating more of our revenues from offshore operations to continue into the increase in the americas revenue was partially offset by the overall reduction in customer call volumes resulting from the economic downturn and the phasing out of two us based original equipment manufacturer oem technology clients 
we anticipate that as our offshore operations grow and become a larger percentage of revenues  the total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline since the average revenue per seat generated offshore is less than it is in north america and europe 
while the average offshore revenue per seat is less  the operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable or higher than those in north america and europe 
however  our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce in offshore markets 
the increase in emea s revenue of million  or  for was primarily related to the strengthening euro  which positively impacted revenues for by approximately million compared to the euro in without this foreign currency benefit  emea s revenues would have declined million compared with last year due to the continued softness in customer call volumes resulting from the weak european economy 
direct salaries and related costs direct salaries and related costs increased million or to million for  from million in as a percentage of revenues  direct salaries and related costs increased to in from for this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in staffing and training costs associated with the ramp up of new business in our offshore operations  lower call volumes in the united states and europe and lower margin european centers that were closed in the first quarter of in connection with our restructuring plan 
although the strengthening euro positively impacted revenues  it increased direct salaries and related costs for by approximately million compared to the euro in 
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for  from million in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decrease was principally attributable to lower depreciation and bad debt expense partially offset by higher insurance and compliance costs as well as higher lease  travel  training  utilities and maintenance costs associated with the expansion of offshore facilities and certain duplicative operating costs related to the call volumes migrating offshore 
similar to the negative effect on direct salaries and related costs  the strengthening euro also increased general and administrative expenses for by approximately million compared to the euro in net gain on disposal of property and equipment the net gain on disposal of property and equipment of million for included a million net gain on the sale of our scottsbluff  nebraska facility which was closed in connection with the restructuring plan and a million portion of the net gain related to the installment sale of our eveleth  minnesota facility offset by a million loss on disposal of property and equipment 
this compares to a million net gain on disposal of property and equipment for  which included a million net gain on the sale of one of our bismarck  north dakota facilities offset by a million net loss on the sale of certain assets of the print facility in galashiels  scotland and a million loss on disposal of property and equipment

other income and expense other income was million for  compared to other expense of million for this change of million was primarily attributable to a million charge for the uninsured portion of a class action settlement in  a million increase in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents net of interest expense and a increase in foreign currency translation gains net of losses and other miscellaneous income 
provision benefit for income taxes the tax provision of million was based upon pre tax book income of million  whereas the tax benefit of million was based upon a pretax book loss of million 
the million change was primarily attributable to the million change in pre tax book income 
the increase in the effective tax rate for resulted from a shift in our mix of earnings within tax jurisdictions and the related effects of permanent differences  state income taxes  varying foreign income tax rates including tax holiday jurisdictions and requisite valuation allowances

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services  invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
on august   the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to three million shares of its outstanding common stock 
a total of million shares have been repurchased under this program since inception 
the shares are purchased  from time to time  through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions  and the purchases are based on factors  including but not limited to  the stock price and general market conditions 
for the year ended december   the company had repurchased approximately million common shares under the repurchase program at prices ranging between and per share for a total cost of million 
during the year ended december   we generated million in cash from operating activities and received million in cash from issuance of stock  million in cash from the sale of facilities  property and equipment and million in cash from an insurance settlement and insurance payment for business interruption 
further  we used million in funds for capital expenditures and million to repurchase stock in the open market resulting in a million increase in available cash including the favorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million  compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a net decrease in non cash reconciling items of million such as deferred income taxes  net gain on disposal of property and equipment  gain on a property insurance settlement and foreign exchange gain  a net change in assets and liabilities of million  offset by an increase in net income of million 
this million net change in assets and liabilities was principally a result of a million increase in receivables  a million decrease in income taxes payable and million decrease in deferred revenue and other liabilities offset by a million increase in other assets 
capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  which was driven primarily by declining investments in offshore facilities 
during the year ended december   approximately of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer contact management centers  primarily offshore  and was expended primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of million to million 
one primary source of future cash flows from financing activities is from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which amount is subject to certain borrowing limitations 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  the amount of million may be increased up to a maximum of million with the prior written consent of the lenders 
the million credit facility includes a million swingline subfacility  a million letter of credit subfacility and a million multi currency subfacility 
the credit facility  which includes certain financial covenants  may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions  share repurchases  working capital support  and letters of credit  subject to certain limitations 
the credit facility  including the multi currency subfacility  accrues interest  at our option  at a the base rate defined as the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus an applicable margin up to  or b the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin up to 
borrowings under the swingline subfacility accrue interest at the prime rate plus an applicable margin up to and borrowings under the letter of credit subfacility accrue interest at the libor plus an applicable margin up to 
in addition  a commitment fee of up to is charged on the unused portion of the credit facility on a quarterly basis 
the borrowings under the credit facility  which will terminate on march   are secured by a pledge of of the stock of each of our direct foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness  subject to certain specific exclusions 
there were no borrowings in and no outstanding balances 
table of contents as of december  with million availability under the credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the credit facility 
at december   we had million in cash  of which approximately million was held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states 
on october  the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and  as of today  uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
as such  we are not yet in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us based on our analysis to date  however  it is reasonably possible that we may repatriate some amount up to million 
the related range of income tax effects of such repatriation cannot reasonably be estimated 
we expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by december  we believe that our current cash levels  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements if any  continued expansion objectives  anticipated levels of capital expenditures for the foreseeable future and stock repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include i indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition and the emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sab  as amended  and sab summarize certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
eitf no 
provides further guidance on how to account for multiple element contracts 
we recognize revenue from services as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement and record estimated reductions to revenue for penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
royalty revenue is recognized at the time royalties are earned and the remaining revenue is recognized on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies on estimates of total expected revenue and related costs 
revisions to these estimates  which could result in adjustments to fixed price contracts and estimated losses  are recorded in the period when such adjustments or losses are known 
product sales are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
we recognize revenue from licenses of our software products and rights when the agreement has been executed  the product or right has been delivered or provided  collectibility is probable and the software license fees or 
table of contents rights are fixed and determinable 
if any portion of the license fees or rights is subject to forfeiture  refund or other contractual contingencies  we postpone revenue recognition until these contingencies have been removed 
revenue from support and maintenance activities is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue 
certain contracts to sell our products and services contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  we evaluate each contract and a thorough contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and the timing of revenue recognition for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
we recognize revenue associated with the grants of land and the cash grants for the acquisition of property  buildings and equipment for customer contact management centers over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets 
should the useful lives of these assets change for reasons such as the sale or disposal of the property  the amount of revenue recognized would be adjusted accordingly 
deferred grants totaled million as of december  of the million  million is classified as current and the remaining million is classified as non current 
income from operations included amortization of the deferred grants of million for the year ended december  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million as of december   or of receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would reduce income from operations 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of million 
we maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  both positive and negative  for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
as of december   we determined the valuation allowance of million was necessary to reduce foreign deferred tax assets approximately million and us deferred tax assets approximately million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax assets of million is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within these tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we hold a minority interest in shps  incorporated as a result of the sale of a ownership interest in june we account for the remaining interest at cost  which was million as of december  fair value is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment and it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the investment without incurring excessive costs 
we will record an impairment charge or loss if we believe the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future

r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june   therefore  we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based compensation in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts for through  as if the fair value based method had been used  similar to the methods required under sfas no 
r to measure compensation expense for employee stock awards

in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf addresses whether the equity method of accounting should be applied to investments when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means 
eitf states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock of a corporation  provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
the effective date of eitf is the first reporting period beginning after september  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment evaluations for securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step test to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the effective date of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf no 
however  the disclosure provisions remain effective for fiscal years ending after june  the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and a revised interpretation of fin no 
fin no 
r in december  in an effort to expand upon existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should consolidate the financial results of another entity 
fin no 
requires variable interest entities  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of expected losses of the entity or is entitled to receive a majority of expected residual returns of the entity  or both 
a company that is required to consolidate a variable interest entity is referred to as the entity s primary beneficiary 
the interpretation also requires certain disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation and disclosure requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity created after january  nor do we have a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity created after january  
table of contents for variable interest entities that existed before february   the consolidation requirements of fin no 
r are effective as of march  the adoption of fin no 
r did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the act introduces a special tax deduction on qualified production activities 
fas clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with sfas no 
the adoption of these new tax provisions is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of the act introduces a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
although fas is effective immediately  we do not expect to be able to complete the evaluation of the repatriation provision until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
in january  the treasury department began to issue the first of a series of clarifying guidance documents related to this provision 
the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related range of income tax effects of such repatriation cannot reasonably be estimated 
we expect to complete an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision by the end of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to non us exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us currency exchange rates may affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and transactions initiated in the united states that are denominated in foreign currency 
the principal foreign currency hedged is the euro using foreign currency forward contracts ranging in periods from one to three months 
foreign exchange forward contracts are accounted for on a mark to market basis  with realized and unrealized gains or losses recognized in the current period  as we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as accounting hedges 
unrealized and realized gains or losses related to foreign exchange forward contracts for the years ended december   and were immaterial 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended december   a one point increase in the weighted average interest rate  which generally equals the libor rate plus an applicable margin  would not have had a material impact on our annual interest expense 
at december   we had no debt outstanding at variable interest rates 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
