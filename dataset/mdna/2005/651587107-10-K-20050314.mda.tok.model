other matters holding company structure on august   ethyl filed a request with the internal revenue service irs seeking rulings as to certain federal income tax consequences of the creation of a holding company 
table of contents structure by ethyl and a related internal restructuring 
ethyl received a private letter ruling on february   from the irs stating that the holding company transaction and the internal restructuring generally will qualify as tax free for us federal income tax purposes 
on february   ethyl s board of directors determined that the creation of a holding company structure was in the best interests of ethyl and its shareholders 
the board then unanimously voted to adopt an agreement and plan of merger by and among ethyl  ethyl merger sub  inc  and newmarket merger agreement to create the holding company structure and to recommend that ethyl shareholders approve the transaction 
on may   at ethyl s annual meeting  ethyl shareholders approved the transition to a holding company structure 
under the terms of the merger agreement  ethyl merger sub was merged with and into ethyl effective on june  upon the closing of the transaction  newmarket became the new parent holding company for ethyl and its subsidiaries and each share of ethyl common stock automatically converted into one share of newmarket common stock 
the newmarket common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on june   under the symbol neu 
following the establishment of the holding company structure  we completed the internal restructuring of our subsidiaries as a result of which  newmarket became the parent company of two operating companies  each managing its own assets and liabilities 
those companies are afton  which focuses on petroleum additive products  and ethyl  representing certain manufacturing operations and the tel business 
newmarket also became the parent company of newmarket services corporation  which provides various administrative services to newmarket  afton  and ethyl 
mmt developments in july  afton completed its review of the mmt fleet study report released by the alliance of automobile manufacturers aam in july with the assistance of environ international corporation  we concluded that the aam study reaffirms that mmt is an acceptable fuel constituent that does not harm vehicle emission control systems 
afton reported these conclusions in a paper presented at the society of automotive engineers sae meeting in october in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
nonetheless  the automotive industry continues to persist in demanding that oil companies discontinue the use of mmt and that governments disallow the use of the product 
the automotive industry has more recently alleged that mmt may cause catalyst plugging in vehicles equipped with the most advanced emission control systems 
however  no credible evidence to support this allegation has been provided by the automobile industry to us 
as part of its ongoing research activities  afton continues to monitor and test mmt compatibility with modern emission control systems and catalysts 
in december  the government of canada released its proposed framework for an independent third party review of new information on the effects of mmt on vehicle emissions 
in its proposal  the canadian government provided no timetable for the commencement or completion of the review 
we believe that this independent third party review of mmt  when properly designed  conducted and interpreted  will reaffirm that mmt is compatible with modern emission control devices 
substantially all of our customers in canada have suspended the use of the gasoline additive mmt  pending the results of the government of canada sponsored independent third party review 
to date  the government of canada has not initiated the review 
while this suspension has had a negative impact on our canadian business  we have been able to expand the use of the product in other parts of the world  which has substantially offset the impact from the loss of the canadian business 
mmt is one of the most extensively tested fuel additives in history 
while we are disappointed with the decision of our customers in canada  we believe that mmt is an environmentally beneficial product that has proven its effectiveness in real world use

operating rates of the plants vary with product mix and normal sales swings 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
during  we ceased manufacturing at our facility in rio de janeiro  brazil 
this facility is currently operating as a terminal location providing storage  blending  and distribution of petroleum additives 
item legal proceedings we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to our business and include administrative or judicial actions seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund 
these proceedings include certain product liability cases 
the only product liability cases of potential consequence in which we are involved are tel related 
in one case  ethyl was served as a defendant in a case filed in the circuit court for baltimore city  maryland  in september smith  et al 
v 
lead industries association  inc  et al  alleged personal injuries for seven children from lead exposure arising from lead paint and dust from tailpipe emissions due to leaded gasoline 
the court dismissed ethyl and some other defendants from the case in february and granted summary judgment to other defendants in november the plaintiffs have appealed both decisions  but did not appeal the dismissal of ethyl as a defendant 
the court of special appeals of maryland reversed the trial court s decision in part  but noted in its decision that the claims 
table of contents related to tailpipe emissions the only claims concerning ethyl had not been appealed 
the court of appeals of maryland granted the petition for a writ of certiorari and heard arguments during the january session of the court  but no decision has been rendered 
if such claims are further pursued against ethyl  we believe ethyl has strong defenses and will vigorously defend any such claims 
like many other companies  we are also a defendant in personal injury lawsuits involving exposure to asbestos 
these cases involve exposure to asbestos in premises owned or operated  or formerly owned or operated  by subsidiaries of newmarket 
we have never manufactured  sold or distributed products that contain asbestos 
nearly all of these cases are pending in texas  louisiana  or illinois and involve multiple defendants 
we maintain an accrual for these proceedings 
in addition  in  we recorded a receivable from albemarle in the amount of million for premises asbestos liability obligations 
we invoiced albemarle for the million payment 
albemarle disputes this payment and its obligations for premises asbestos liabilities 
we  however  believe that albemarle is responsible for the payments  as well as certain current and future liability claims  pursuant to an indemnification agreement between the companies dated as of february  we expect to fully recover the amounts in the next twelve months 
we accrue for our premises asbestos liability related to currently asserted claims based on the following assumptions and factors we are often one of many defendants 
this factor influences both the number of claims settled against us and also the indemnity cost associated with such resolutions 
the estimated percent of claimants in each case that will actually  after discovery  make a claim against us  out of the total number of claimants in a case  is based on a level consistent with past experience and current trends 
we utilize average comparable plaintiff cost history as the basis for estimating pending premises asbestos related claims 
these claims are filed by both former contractors employees and former employees who worked at past and present company locations 
we also include an estimated inflation factor in the calculation 
no estimate is made for unasserted claims 
the estimated recoveries from insurance for these cases are based on  and are consistent with  insurance recoveries received in past cases 
based on the above assumptions  we have provided an undiscounted liability related to premises asbestos claims of million at year end and million at year end the liabilities related to asbestos claims are included in accrued expenses current portion and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet 
certain of these costs are recovered through our insurance coverage 
the receivable for insurance recoveries related to premises asbestos liabilities was million at december  and million at december  the insurance receivables are included in trade and other accounts receivable for the current portion 
the noncurrent portion is included in other assets 
newmarket is pursuing recovery of sums we allege are owed to us under certain insurance policies from travelers indemnity company travelers for premises asbestos liability claims 
travelers has been our primary insurer for many years 
we filed a lawsuit against travelers in the southern district of texas in november while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of any legal proceeding  it is our opinion that we have adequate accruals  cash  and insurance coverage such that the outcome of these legal proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  would not result in a material adverse effect on us

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking statements the following discussion contains forward looking statements about future events and expectations within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results 
when we use words in this document  such as anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  expects  and similar expressions  we do so to identify forward looking statements 
examples of forward looking statements include statements we make regarding future prospects of growth in the petroleum additives market  the level of future declines in the market for tel  our ability to maintain or increase our market share  and our future capital expenditure levels 
we believe our forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations and assumptions  within the bounds of what we know about our business and operations 
however  we offer no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations due to uncertainties and factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  timing of sales orders  gain or loss of significant customers  competition from other manufacturers  resolution of environmental liabilities  changes in the demand for our products  significant changes in new product introduction  increases in product cost  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on reported results of operations  changes in various markets  geopolitical risks in certain of the countries in which we conduct business  and the impact of consolidation of the petroleum additives industry

overview the year was a year of many achievements and challenges 
the achievements include the formation of the new holding company  newmarket corporation  which began trading on the new york stock exchange on june   under the trading symbol neu 
we also restructured our term and bank loans during the year with conditions we believe are more consistent with our improved financial condition 
standard poors rating services raised our credit rating during the fourth quarter  which we believe reflects the progress we have made 
afton chemical corporation achieved significant improvements and growth in the petroleum additives business  despite the challenge to recover increasing raw material costs and the subsequent reduction in margins and profits 
ethyl corporation has successfully managed the contribution from the declining tel product line  achieving good results with earnings surpassing the prior year for the second year in a row 
results of operations the results of continuing operations exclude the operations of our phenolic antioxidant business  which was sold in january the earnings results of this business have been removed from net sales and operating profit for prior periods covered in this review 
these results are included in the consolidated statements of income under income from operations of discontinued business 
there was no effect on net income as a result of these reclassifications 

table of contents net sales we continued to improve and grow our business in  realizing increased net sales in essentially all areas of the petroleum additives segment 
we believe that this improvement and growth results from our strong customer relationships and our commitment to supply them with top quality products and services 
our significant investment in customer focused research and development is part of our ongoing effort to improve our products and services to meet our customers needs 
total net sales were higher in than in either of the previous two years  representing an increase of when comparing with and when comparing with in   and  net sales to two customers of our petroleum additives segment exceeded of total net sales 
sales to bp amounted to million of total net sales in  million of total net sales in  and million of total net sales in sales to shell amounted to million of total net sales in  million of total net sales in  and million of total net sales in these net sales represent a wide range of products sold to these two customers in multiple regions of the world 
no other single customer accounted for or more of our total net sales in   or the following table shows our net sales by segment for each of the last three years 
net sales by segment in millions of dollars petroleum additives tetraethyl lead consolidated net sales petroleum additives our petroleum additives sales improved over both and when comparing to  petroleum additives net sales were up million or  reflecting improvements across all product lines 
shipments  driven by the engine oil additives product line  were higher across all product lines resulting in an improvement of about in total shipments 
strengthening of foreign currency  primarily the euro  also had a beneficial impact on net sales 
when comparing and  petroleum additives net sales increased million or above net sales  reflecting improved results across all product lines 
total volumes shipped in were about higher across all product lines than in the components of the petroleum additives increase in net sales of million when comparing to and million when comparing and are shown below in millions 
year ended december  increase in shipments and changes in product mix changes in selling prices including foreign currency impact year ended december  increase in shipments and changes in product mix changes in selling prices including foreign currency impact year ended december  
table of contents tetraethyl lead most of the tel marketing activity is through the agreements with octel  under which we do not record the sales transactions 
therefore  the tel net sales shown in the table above are those made by ethyl in areas not covered by the marketing agreements  as well as sales made to octel under the terms of the agreements 
the sales made in areas not covered by the marketing agreements are very minor compared to the tel sales made through the marketing agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tel net sales were about even when comparing to sales increased million when comparing to sales made to octel in were million higher than sales to octel 
there were no sales to octel during or segment operating profit newmarket evaluates the performance of afton s petroleum additives business and ethyl s tel business based on segment operating profit 
corporate departments and other expenses are billed to afton and ethyl based on the services provided under the holding company structure 
depreciation on segment property  plant  and equipment  and amortization of segment intangible assets and the prepayments for services are included in the operating profit of each segment 
the table below reports operating profit by segment for the last three years 
in the table below  we present operating profit for each of the petroleum additives and tel segments excluding nonrecurring items 
operating profit excluding nonrecurring items is a financial measure that is not required by  or calculated in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
these non gaap financial measures are presented with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and are reconciled to such gaap financial measures 
our management believes this information provides information about our operations and  in doing so  provides transparency to investors and enhances period to period comparability of performance 
our management further believes that this information enables the reader to have a clear understanding of the results of operations included in the gaap financial statements 
certain prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
the reclassifications consist of an allocation of certain costs in alignment with the recent transition to a holding company structure 
the other classification in the table below primarily represents certain contract manufacturing operations 
segment operating profit in millions of dollars petroleum additives before nonrecurring items nonrecurring items petroleum additives tetraethyl lead before nonrecurring items nonrecurring items tetraethyl lead other petroleum additives petroleum additives operating profit  including a nonrecurring gain of million from an environmental insurance settlement  was million as compared to million for the results include a small improvement in the engine oil additives product line and lower results in the other areas 
while both net sales and shipments improved  the rising costs of raw materials  as well as higher selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses and research  development  and testing r d expenses 
table of contents resulted in the reduction in operating profit compared to although the impact of higher selling prices favorably impacted the operating profit  the price increases we have achieved do not cover the increase in raw material costs 
the results include a favorable foreign currency impact  primarily from the euro 
the petroleum additives operating profit of million compares to million for excluding nonrecurring items in  which are discussed below  operating profit was million 
the improvement was the result of many factors 
volumes shipped increased across all product lines 
a favorable foreign exchange impact  primarily from the euro  also contributed to the higher profit 
partially offsetting these factors were higher sg a and r d expenses 
in addition  raw material costs increased due to higher shipments  as well as the rising cost of raw materials 
total r d expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase when comparing and is across all product lines  but mainly in the engine oil additives and specialty additives product lines 
this increase is to support new product specifications  our growth  and our continuing commitment to enhance the value of our product for our customers 
the increase in r d expenses when comparing and reflected higher personnel costs supporting the development and testing of new products  primarily in the specialty additives product line 
there was also a small unfavorable foreign currency impact across all years 
r d related to new products and processes was million in  million in  and million in all of our r d expenses were related to the petroleum additives segment 
sg a for this segment in was approximately million higher than sg a for was approximately million higher than the increases in and included the impact of an unfavorable foreign currency effect 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a combined with r d expenses was in and in both and the percentage reflects the increase in net sales from levels as compared to only increase in sg a and r d 
the essentially unchanged percentage between and reflects similar increases in net sales  as well as sg a and r d between the two years 
in addition to the nonrecurring gain discussed above  there was a nonrecurring gain of thousand for related to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the nonrecurring item for was for a million impairment of goodwill  which was partially offset by a thousand benefit related to a change in estimate of the restructuring accrual for the engine oil additives rationalization 
the goodwill write off was done in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
during  we were notified by dsm copolymer  inc  our supplier of olefin copolymer viscosity index improvers  of its intent to terminate its supply contract with us in mid the contract was initially scheduled to terminate in we have adjusted amortization of the intangible asset associated with this contract to coincide with the termination date 
we have developed other supply alternatives and expect no disruption of supply 
these new alternatives may be more expensive than the previous agreement 
tetraethyl lead results of our tel segment include the operating profit contribution from our marketing agreements  as well as certain tel operations not included in the marketing agreements 
the operating profit contribution from our marketing agreements was million in  million in  and million in as expected  volumes shipped declined when comparing both to and to volumes were lower for compared to and lower when comparing and this was more than offset in each year by improved pricing and lower costs 
included in the lower costs was a reduction of million in amortization of certain tel alliance costs when comparing to  reflecting the declining balance method of amortization 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization costs in were thousand lower than the tel market will continue to decline as customers discontinue use of the product 

table of contents the loss from other tel operations that were not a part of the marketing agreements was approximately flat when comparing to and million lower when comparing to the combined environmental and premises asbestos charges during were approximately even with the year included charges related to environmental remediation and premises asbestos liability claims that were million higher than these charges in were partially offset by approximately million resulting from the benefit of a legal settlement for the recovery of operating costs 
in addition  profits benefited from sales to octel  which were approximately million higher than neither nor included earnings from the sale of lead inventory to octel 
the year includes a million nonrecurring gain from an environmental insurance settlement 
the nonrecurring income of million in resulted from the implementation of sfas no 
the nonrecurring charge of million in was for the impairment of goodwill upon the adoption of sfas no 
while the market for this product is continuing to decline  it continues to supply ethyl with strong cash flows 
the following discussion references certain captions on the consolidated statements of income 
special item income special item income was million in and represents the gain on an environmental insurance settlement 
the terms of the settlement provide for a total payment of million

partially offsetting these was a higher average interest rate resulting in an increase in expense of million 
comparing to  lower average debt outstanding resulted in a reduction of million  while higher average interest rates resulted in an increase of million 
fees and amortization of financing costs in were million lower than the higher average interest rates for and result  in part  from million of our total debt being at a fixed rate of since april on june   prior to the completion of the holding company formation  ethyl entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  which consists of a million revolving credit facility 
this agreement amended and restated the credit agreement that ethyl entered into on april  the premium to libor is lower in the amended and restated credit agreement 
in addition  effective june  and in connection with the holding company formation  newmarket assumed ethyl s rights  liabilities and obligations under ethyl s senior notes due the senior notes otherwise remain unchanged

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from to resulted in an increase of million in income taxes in this was partially offset by a million decrease resulting from the lower effective tax rate 
the lower effective tax rate in compared to last year includes the benefit of reaching agreement with the internal revenue service on settlement of certain open tax years  as well as lower state income taxes 
the increase in our income from continuing operations before income taxes from to resulted in the million increase in income taxes in the effective tax rate was almost unchanged between and our deferred taxes are in a net asset position and based on forecast operating plans  we believe that we will recover the full benefit of our deferred tax assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on income taxes 
income from operations of discontinued business following an extensive assessment of our phenolic antioxidant business  we concluded this business was not part of our future core business or growth goals 
accordingly  after approval by the board of directors in december  on january   we completed the sale of our phenolic antioxidant business to albemarle 
as part of the transaction  we sold accounts receivable and inventory  as well as fixed assets at our orangeburg  south carolina facility 
the income from operations of discontinued business reflected in our consolidated statements of income is on an after tax basis 
the amount is the after tax gain on the disposal of the business of million million before tax 
prior year amounts represent the after tax earnings of the business 
the net sales of the discontinued business were million for cumulative effect of accounting changes as discussed above in the segment operating profit section  during first quarter  we recognized a gain of million million after tax on the implementation of sfas no 
we wrote off goodwill of million million after tax in first quarter in accordance with sfas no 
under the undiscounted cash flow model that we used prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the goodwill was not impaired and  therefore  had not been previously written off 
net income net income was million per share in  million per share in  and million per share in due to the significant impact on earnings of nonrecurring items and

our management further believes that this information enables the reader to have a clear understanding of the results of operations included in the gaap financial statements 
included in our results in the selling  general  and administrative expense line of our consolidated statements of income is an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses of million in over the major components of this increase are legal expenses associated with the establishment of the holding company and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley legislation 
the same costs in were also million higher than  primarily reflecting increased insurance  legal  and personnel expenses 
the cost of our pensions is also a factor in comparing our earnings results from year to year 
pension expense on a pre tax basis was million higher in than in due primarily to changes in rate assumptions 
pre tax pension expense was million higher in than the increase when comparing to levels was caused substantially by lower asset values in our current plans due to market volatility  changes in rate assumptions  and an unfavorable foreign currency impact

financial position and liquidity we reduced our debt million in  million in  and million in this comes after having reduced the debt by million in our debt reduction was less than prior years due to the need to increase working capital to support business growth and to build inventory to manage the change in the supply of viscosity index improver resulting from our supplier s decision to close the plant that currently provides us with this product 
our debt position has improved substantially since  and we are now in a leverage range where debt reduction is no longer a priority 
we continue to use free cash flow to reduce debt  while reviewing other opportunities 
cash at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at the end of we also had restricted cash of million at december  and million at december  of these funds at december   million was cash received from metropolitan life insurance company metropolitan in these funds amounted to million at december  we also had thousand of similar funds at december   which had been received from the demutualization of metropolitan in the funds from metropolitan were used to reduce the employee portion of retiree health benefits costs and had been used at december  the funds from metropolitan are also being used for employee benefit purposes 
the remaining thousand of restricted cash at december  represents funds related to the issuance of a european bank guarantee 
this guarantee amounted to thousand at december  
table of contents at both december  and december   we had a book overdraft for some of our disbursement cash accounts 
a book overdraft represents transactions that have not cleared the bank accounts at the end of the reporting period 
we transfer cash on an as needed basis to fund these items as they clear the bank in subsequent periods 
debt senior notes on april   ethyl sold senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million that bear interest at a fixed rate of and are due in the senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by all of our existing and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and certain of our existing wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
we incurred financing costs of approximately million related to the senior notes  which are being amortized over seven years 
in connection with the holding company formation  effective june   newmarket assumed all of ethyl s rights  liabilities and obligations under the senior notes 
the senior notes and the subsidiary guarantees rank effectively junior to all of our and the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness  including any borrowings under the senior credit facility described below  equal in right of payment with any of our and the guarantors existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to any of our and the guarantors existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends or repurchase capital stock  make certain investments  sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
we were in compliance with the covenants in the senior notes as of both december  and december  senior credit facility on april   we entered into a long term debt structure for ethyl 
the debt structure included the senior notes discussed above and a senior credit facility with a bank term loan and a revolving credit facility 
on june   prior to the completion of the holding company formation  ethyl entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  which consists of a million revolving credit facility 
this agreement amended and restated the credit agreement that ethyl had entered into on april  effective with the completion of the holding company formation  newmarket assumed all of ethyl s rights and obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement pursuant to the first amendment thereto 
we incurred additional financing costs of approximately million  which resulted in total deferred financing costs of approximately million related to the amended and restated credit facility 
these costs are being amortized over five years 
the million revolver is for working capital and other general corporate purposes for newmarket and our subsidiaries and includes a sub facility for letters of credit 
borrowings bear interest  at our election  at either 
table of contents a base rate plus a margin basis points as of december  or libor plus a margin basis points as of december  
the revolving credit facility matures on june  borrowings outstanding at december  under the revolving credit facility were million and bore interest at rates of to  depending upon the type of borrowing 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  resulting in the unused portion of the revolver amounting to million 
the revolving credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our us assets 
in addition  the credit facility is guaranteed by our us subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries to the extent that such guarantees would not result in adverse tax consequences 
the credit agreement contains covenants  representations  and events of default that management considers typical of a credit agreement of this nature 
we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility as of both december  and december  the financial covenants include minimum consolidated net worth  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  and restrictions on the payment of dividends or repurchases of capital stock 
we had combined current and noncurrent long term debt of million at december   representing a net reduction of million in our total debt since december  the net reduction in debt represents the pay off of million on the term loan  as well as a decrease of thousand on the capital lease obligations 
these reductions were partially offset by the net borrowing of million on the revolving credit facility 
during  we paid down total debt by million 
the net reduction in debt includes the full payment of the debt under our previous credit facility of million and full payment of our private borrowing from bruce c 
gottwald of million 
these payments were offset by the new borrowing amounting to million on the senior notes and million on the term loan 
subsequent to the refinancing of our debt in  we made payments of million on the term loan 
capital lease obligations also decreased thousand 
all of our debt is discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of total capitalization total long term debt and shareholders equity  our total debt decreased from at the end of to at the end of the decrease reflects the reduction in total debt  as well as the increase in shareholders equity due to earnings 
normally  we repay long term debt with cash from operations  as well as with proceeds from occasional sales of business units  plant sites  or other assets 
working capital at december   we had working capital of million  resulting in a current ratio which is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities of to our working capital at year end was million resulting in a current ratio of to the increase in working capital and the current ratio primarily reflects an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales and a receivable from the environmental insurance settlement  as well as an increase in inventory 
the inventory increase includes the impact of the growth in the petroleum additives business  as well as the result of our viscosity index improver supplier s plans to close the plant that currently provides us with this product 
as part of our transition plan  we built inventory of this product  which will be used during the course of 
table of contents in addition  the current portion of long term debt decreased resulting from the amended and restated credit agreement and the first amendment thereto which we entered into during june partially offsetting these was an increase in accounts payable  largely driven by higher inventory requirements  as well as higher prices 
capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures to be in the million range in we expect capital spending for environmental and safety projects will be approximately million to million over each of the next two years due to modifications needed to meet the miscellaneous organic natural emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants regulation 
we expect to continue to finance capital spending through cash provided from operations  together with borrowing available under our senior credit facility 
sale leaseback transaction in june  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction for the land  buildings  and certain equipment located at our bracknell  england facility 
we received million for the assets  which had a net book value of million 
the resulting operating lease is for ten years with an option to terminate the lease after five years 
the gain of million was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the lease agreement 
environmental expenses we spent approximately million in and million in both and for environmental operating and clean up costs  excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures 
of these amounts  the ongoing costs of operations were million in and million in and the balance represents clean up  or remediation and monitoring costs 
these environmental operating and clean up expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
in the next year  we expect environmental operating and remediation costs to be about the same as further  we expect to continue to fund these costs through cash provided by operations 
contractual obligations the table below shows our year end contractual obligations by year due 
payments due by period in millions of dollars total less than year years years more than years long term debt a interest payable on long term debt and capital lease obligations a letters of credit b capital lease obligations a operating leases property  plant  and equipment purchase obligations raw material purchase obligations c other long term liabilities d a amounts represent contractual payments due on the senior notes and revolving credit agreement  as well as the capital lease obligations 
b we intend to renew letters of credit when necessary as they mature  therefore  the obligations do not have a definitive maturity date 

table of contents c raw material purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on afton or ethyl and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
d these represent other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams 
amounts include asset retirement obligations and contributions associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans 
amounts accrued for the potential exposure with respect to litigation  claims  and assessments are not included in the table above 
under the tel marketing agreements with octel  we are required to provide approximately one third of the cost of product sold to customers in the territory from our inventory or post an equivalent dollar value deposit with octel 
the value of our available inventory fell below the requirement at year end and was substantially depleted at year end as it was utilized for sales under the agreements 
the dollar value requirement was million at december  and million at december  we now cover this requirement of the marketing agreements through the value of a working capital advance due from octel 
we funded this advance in and it is being paid to us as the requirement decreases and will be paid in full at the end of the agreements 
these amounts have been recorded in other assets and deferred charges 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas to account for our pension and postretirement plans 
we use a december measurement date to determine our pension and postretirement expenses and related financial disclosure information 
investment return assumptions under sfas and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on pension plan assets 
as part of the review and to develop expected rates of return  our independent consulting actuaries performed a stochastic analysis of expected returns based on the domestic plans asset allocation as of both january  and january  this forecast reflects our actuarial firm s expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
as of january   our actuarial firm s expected rates were last year for us large cap stocks  last year for us long term corporate bonds  and last year for inflation 
the range of returns developed relies both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
while the expected investment return assumption is long term in nature  the range of reasonable returns has dropped over the past few years as a consequence of lower inflation and lower bond yields 
nevertheless  because our asset allocation is predominantly weighted toward equities  we have maintained our expected long term rate of return for our domestic plans at for the last several years 
actuarial losses  where the actual return was less than the expected return  resulted during and the one year investment return was lower than the long term assumption by about million in and million in for all of our domestic pension plans 
by contrast  actual investment return exceeded assumed return in by about million 
investment losses enter earnings on an amortized basis so that recent years losses resulted in increased expense of about million in  as well as an expected million increased expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the results justify the risk premium for equity investments 

table of contents pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our domestic pension plans by about thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by about thousand 
discount rate assumption under sfas and sfas in accordance with sfas and sfas  we set the discount rate for our retirement plans by reference to investment grade bond yields 
we use moody s published aa yield for long term corporate bonds for the last day of december as an index  and our discount rate will be within basis points of the index 
moody s aa yield dropped from for december  to for december  accordingly  we reduced our discount rate for all domestic plans from as of december  to as of december  we maintained our rate of projected compensation increase at december  at 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our domestic pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate domestic cash contributions  before income taxes  will be approximately million in  while foreign cash contributions will be approximately million 
in addition to the estimated million cash contribution for domestic plans  we expect the rabbi trust will contribute approximately million for the nonqualified plan 
other assumptions under sfas during  we reviewed our assumption for the health care cost trend rate under sfas this review was done with reference to cost increases in our own plans  as well as broader market increases in employer provided health care costs and observations of sfas assumptions used by other large employers 
consequently  as of december   we increased our assumption for the health care cost trend rate substantially to a rate of in scaling down to over the next ten years 
previously  the health care cost trend rate was to 
the assumption of declining inflation is consistent with the expectation that medical cost increases will abate after several years of double digit growth 
we have reviewed these assumptions and believe they continue to be appropriate for the expected long term rate of return on our postretirement plans is 
this rate varies from the pension rate of primarily because of the difference in investment of assets 
the assets of the postretirement plan are held in an insurance contract  which results in a lower assumed rate of investment return 
outlook petroleum additives we made many improvements and grew the petroleum additives business during with shipments up compared to last year 
the future profits of this segment will continue to be influenced by the factors we have discussed during this year 
those major factors include our ability to recover increasing costs of raw materials in the market place 
with crude oil in the to per barrel range  our raw materials remain very high 
we have been working to recover these higher costs through several price increases 
generally  our margins are reduced when the costs of raw materials are rising rapidly  as our ability to raise prices lags the impact of the raw material increases 
in addition to crude oil being high  many of the commodity chemicals we purchase are in tight demand  which increases the prices for these chemicals 
consequently  even if crude oil comes down from these high levels  many of our raw material costs will remain high 

table of contents the relative value of the us dollar to foreign currencies  predominately the euro 
with our mix of business  our results are favorably impacted when the dollar is weak  relative to the euro 
we have enjoyed increased profits this year due to this relationship 
our ability to continue to deliver solutions to our customers to help grow their businesses and the resulting need to spend research dollars to support those efforts 
current business factors would lead us to expect that the operating profit for petroleum additives will be higher in than in tel there have been no major changes to the factors that influence the profits that we will earn from tel in any given year 
tel continues to be phased out around the world 
we have been somewhat successful in reducing the profit impact of the volume decline with improvements in price  as we set prices based on the economic value of the product 
we expect that tel will earn less in than in cash flow we expect that our debt reduction capacity from our cash flow for will be in the million to million range 
with only million of bank debt on the balance sheet  we expect to build cash for future corporate needs once this amount has been paid

bruce c 
gottwald and floyd d 
gottwald  jr  who are brothers collectively  the gottwalds  each owns more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
effective september   newmarket services corporation newmarket services  entered into a membership units purchase and assignment agreement the agreement  with the gottwalds and old town llc old town under which newmarket services agreed to purchase all of the voting and non voting units in old town llc owned by the gottwalds 
the purchase price of million was based on an appraisal conducted by an independent third party 
the agreement also provided that each of the gottwalds must resign as a manager of old town 
our audit committee and all of our independent directors unanimously approved the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  in the event that newmarket services decides to sell substantially all of the assets of old town and receives an offer from a third party for such assets  newmarket services must provide the offer to the gottwalds  who will have days to purchase the assets of old town on the same terms and conditions as contained in the third party offer 
in april  we had sold the property  located in king william  virginia and consisting of approximately  acres  to old town  llc  which at the time was owned by the gottwalds for million in cash based on independent appraisals 
we managed the property for old town  llc 
on february   bruce c 
gottwald made a loan to ethyl in the amount of million for a three year term at an interest rate of 
the monthly payments were interest only during the term of the loan  with the principal amount coming due at maturity 
we used the proceeds of the loan to pay down then existing debt 
the loan was non recourse to ethyl and was secured by a first deed of trust on the three buildings at south fourth street  richmond  virginia  that constitute our principal offices 
an independent appraiser valued the three buildings at million 
this loan was paid in full on april  
table of contents on february   ethyl completed the spin off of albemarle 
the two companies have agreements that describe the conditions under which albemarle must reimburse newmarket for tax  environmental  and certain other liabilities 
generally  albemarle is responsible for tax  environmental  and certain other exposures related to its operations before the spin off of albemarle 
we believe that albemarle has the ability to comply with this indemnification agreement 
further information  including comments regarding a million receivable we have recorded from albemarle  is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
newmarket and albemarle have agreements to coordinate certain facilities and services  including albemarle s ongoing production of mmt for us 
in connection with these agreements  albemarle billed us approximately million in both and and million in the decrease in reflects the sale of the phenolic antioxidant business to albemarle in january after the sale of the business  albemarle no longer supplied us with antioxidant finished products for third party resale 
they continue to supply mmt  as well as our internal needs for antioxidants 
on january   we completed the sale of our phenolic antioxidants business to albemarle 
the decision to sell the phenolic antioxidants business followed an extensive strategic assessment of our business assets where we concluded the phenolic antioxidants business was not part of our future core business or growth goals 
further information is provided above in the income from operations of discontinued business section of item critical accounting policies it is our goal to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and our financial condition 
we do this by including the information required by the securities and exchange commission  as well as additional information that gives further insight into our financial operations 
our financial report includes a discussion of our accounting principles  as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe these discussions and statements fairly represent the financial position and operating results of our company 
the purpose of this portion of our discussion is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in reported financial results 
as discussed in various sections of our report  we have made certain payments related to our tel marketing agreements 
we made the final payment of million in the unamortized total is million at december  we are amortizing these costs on an accelerated basis using a declining balance method over the life of the contracts 
we believe this is the appropriate methodology and time period for this amortization based on the facts and circumstances of our tel operations and the estimated product life of tel 
the customer base of tel is significantly concentrated in a few countries and when conditions change that cause a shorter product life or other restrictions outside of our control  the amortization period is adjusted accordingly 
any adjustment to the amortization period would impact earnings  but would have no effect on cash flows 
we continue to keep our accounting for this issue current with the business conditions 
we also have certain identifiable intangibles amounting to million at year end that are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these intangibles relate to our petroleum additives business and are being amortized over periods with up to eleven years of remaining life 
we continue to assess the market related to these intangibles  as well as their specific values  and have concluded the amortization periods and values are appropriate 
during  due to a change in a contract  we modified the amortization period of one of the identifiable intangibles from nine remaining years to two remaining years 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment 
these evaluations continue to support the value at which these identifiable intangibles are carried on our financial statements 
however  if conditions were to substantially deteriorate in this market  it could possibly cause a reduction in the periods of this amortization charge or could 
table of contents possibly result in a noncash write off of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in the amortization period would have no cash effect 
while we do not anticipate such a change in the market conditions  this disclosure is provided to enhance the understanding of the factors involved 
we have made disclosure of our environmental issues in item of this report  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our environmental accruals are appropriate for the exposures and regulatory guidelines under which we currently operate 
while we currently do not anticipate significant changes to the many factors that could impact our environmental requirements  we continue to keep our accruals consistent with these requirements as they change 
also  as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings in item of this report  while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of any legal proceeding  we do not believe that we will experience any material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of any pending or threatened proceeding 
we use significant assumptions to record the impact of the pension and postretirement plans in the financial statements 
these assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rate 
a change in any one of these assumptions could result in significantly different results for the plans 
we develop these assumptions after considering advice from a major global actuarial consulting firm 
information is provided on the pension and postretirement plans in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  further disclosure on the effect of changes in these assumptions is provided in the financial position and liquidity section of item recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

the statement is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in general  the statement provides guidance in accounting for transactions in which a company obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
the statement requires that the cost from share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and be determined using a fair value based measurement method 
this standard is effective for interim periods beginning after june  and applies to all share based payment transactions initiated or modified after the effective date 
we are evaluating this statement  but do not expect it to have a significant impact on our financial results

in addition  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  which provides guidance on the act s repatriation provision 
the deduction for qualified production activities under the act became effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of the fasb guidance related to qualified production activities on our effective tax rate for future periods 
the fasb has also provided guidance for the appropriate point at which a company should reflect in its financial statements the effects of a one time tax benefit on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
based on current facts and circumstances  we have concluded that we currently do not qualify for this one time tax benefit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to many market risk factors including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates  as well as changes in the cost of raw materials and marketable security prices 
these risk factors may affect our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 

table of contents we manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
when we have derivative instruments  they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes 
also  as part of our financial risk management  we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives 
as of december   based on our review  we had no contracts with an embedded derivative 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at year end we analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million with million at variable interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  if the variable portion of the weighted average interest rates on the variable rate debt hypothetically increased approximately basis points  the effect on our earnings and cash flows would have been higher interest expense of thousand 
since most of our debt at year end is at a fixed rate  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  holding all other variables constant  would have resulted in a change of million in fair value 
foreign currency risk we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries  as well as through export sales from our plants in the united states 
these transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
during  we entered into million of euro denominated forward contracts to minimize currency exposure from expected cash flows from foreign operations 
the contracts all have maturity dates in with other variables held constant  a hypothetical adverse change in the december  forward euro rates would have resulted in a decrease of about million in the value of these contracts 
raw material price risk we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  olefin copolymers  maleic anhydride  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
if we experience sudden or sharp increases in the cost of our raw materials  we may not be able to pass on these increases in whole or in part to our customers 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
if we cannot pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products  there will be a negative impact on operating profit 
during  dsm copolymer  inc  our supplier of olefin copolymer viscosity index improvers  notified us of its intent to terminate a long term supply agreement in mid the contract was initially scheduled to terminate in we have developed other supply alternatives and expect no disruption of supply 
these new alternatives may be more expensive than the previous agreement 
marketable security price risk at year end  our marketable securities had a fair value of million  including net unrealized gains of thousand 
the estimated loss in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the price would have been thousand 
since the securities are classified as available for sale  adjustments to fair value of a temporary nature are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and would not impact our results of operations or cash flows until such time that the securities are sold or that the impairment is determined to be other than temporary in nature 

table of contents other risk factors our business is subject to many factors that could materially adversely affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made in this annual report 
those risk factors are outlined below competition could adversely affect our operating results 
our profits could suffer from over capacity in our industry  and we may not be able to continue to reduce cost and enhance our competitiveness 
raw materials or energy price increases may adversely affect our profit margins 
our reliance on a small number of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  and continued oil industry consolidation could have a negative impact on product pricing 
our customers are concentrated in the fuel and lubricant industries and  as a result  our reliance on these industries is significant 
our business may suffer from declines in overall demand for our lubricant and fuel additives 
we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry 
the amount and timing of our technology costs will vary depending on the frequency of change in industry performance standards  the product life cycles and the relative demand for our products 
our tel business has declined and will continue to decline 
our tel results would be adversely affected if octel became unable to meet its obligations under the marketing agreements 
several of our products are produced solely at one facility  and a significant disruption or disaster at such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face risks related to our foreign operations that may negatively affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by the political  social  economic and regulatory factors associated with conducting business in regions outside of north america  especially latin america and the middle east 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our future performance and growth could be adversely affected 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our pension funds  which may be under funded due to past and any future underperformance of the equities markets 
our business is subject to government regulation  and could be adversely affected by future government regulation  resulting in increased regulatory compliance costs 
political  economic and regulatory factors could negatively impact our sales of mmt 
legal proceedings and other claims  including product liability  hazardous substances  and premises asbestos claims  could impose substantial costs on us 
environmental matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations 
we have been identified  and in the future may be identified  as a potentially responsible party in connection with state and federal laws regarding environmental clean up projects 
our financial results will vary according to the timing of customer orders and other external factors  which reduces your ability to gauge our performance and increases your risk of an investment in our securities 
if we were to discover a material deficiency in our system of internal controls over financial reporting  it could have a substantial negative impact on our common stock price or our ability to conduct business in the current manner
