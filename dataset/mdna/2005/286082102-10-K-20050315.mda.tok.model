item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers and if we are not able to compete successfully then our business may be harmed 
we also have a continuing relationship pursuant to a license agreement with adobe and license postscript software from adobe for use in many of our controller solutions 
this relationship is important because each of our controller solutions requires page description language software such as that provided by adobe in order to operate 
adobe s postscript software is widely used to manage the geometry  shape and 
table of contents typography of hard copy documents and adobe is a leader in providing page description software 
although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript software when required  adobe is not required to and we cannot be certain that adobe will  grant future licenses to adobe postscript software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  in order to obtain licenses from adobe  adobe requires that we obtain from them quality assurance approvals for our products that use adobe software 
if adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals  if the adobe licenses are terminated  or if our relationship with adobe is otherwise materially impaired  we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate adobe postscript software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
distribution and marketing our primary distribution method for our controller solutions is to sell them to our oems 
our oems in turn sell these products to oem affiliated and independent distributors dealers resellers and end users for use with the oems copiers or printers as part of an integrated printing system 
for fiery embedded controller solutions  our primary distribution method has been to sell the products to the oems that embed the products into their copiers and printers 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem customers and the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
our primary distribution method for our edox  docstream and micropress servers  our efi proofing solutions and our efi workflow software products is to sell them directly to our authorized distributors dealers resellers who in turn sell the solutions to end users either in a stand alone form or bundled with other solutions they offer 
primary customers with whom we have established distribution agreements include kodak polychrome graphics  enovation  heidelberg  screen usa  pitman  presstek and others 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully distribute our products through these channels 
our print management information solutions are primarily sold directly to the end user by efi s own sales force 
any interruption of the distribution methods could negatively impact us in the future 
we promote all of our products through public relations  direct mail  advertising  promotional material  trade shows and ongoing customer communication programs 
research and development research and development costs for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   of our  full time employees were involved in research and development 
we believe that development of new products and enhancement of existing products are essential to our continued success and management intends to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development 
we expect to make significant expenditures to support our research and development programs for the foreseeable future 
we are developing products to support additional color and black and white printing devices including desktop printers  high end color copiers  digital black and white copiers and multifunctional devices 
this ongoing development work includes a multiprocessor architecture for high end systems and lower cost designs for desktop color laser printers 
we are also developing new software applications designed to maximize workflow efficiencies and to meet the needs of the graphic arts and commercial print professional  including proofing solutions and print management information systems solutions 
we also expect to continue to enhance functionality of our other product lines  including our enterprise solutions 
see growth and expansion strategies proliferate and expand product lines 
substantial additional work and expense will be required to complete and bring to market each of the products currently being developed by us see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance if we are unable to develop new products  or execute product introductions on a timely basis  our future revenue and operating results may be harmed 

table of contents manufacturing we utilize sub contractors to manufacture our products 
these sub contractors work closely with us to promote low costs and high quality in the manufacture of our products 
sub contractors purchase components needed for our products from third parties 
we are completely dependent on the ability of our sub contractors to produce products sold by us and although we supervise our sub contractors  there can be no assurance that such sub contractors will perform efficiently or effectively 
a high concentration of our products is manufactured at a single sub contractor location  sanmina sci in colorado 
should sanmina sci experience any inability or unwillingness to manufacture or deliver product from this location our business  financial condition and operations could be harmed 
since we do not maintain long term agreements with our sub contractors  any of our sub contractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit such sub contractors from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability of such sub contractor from filling our orders in a timely manner 
a significant number of the components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these include processors from intel and other related semiconductor components 
we depend largely on the following sole and limited source suppliers for our components and manufacturing services supplier components intel central processing units  or cpus  chip sets toshiba asics lsi asics texas instruments digital signal processors  or dsps sanmina sci contract manufacturing transmeta cpus we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers of components and conduct our business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers were unwilling or unable to supply us with the components for which we rely on them  we may be unable to continue manufacturing our products utilizing such components 
the absence of agreements with our suppliers also subjects us to fluctuations in pricing  a factor we believe is partially offset by the fact that our suppliers benefit from selling as many components to us as possible 
many of our components are similar to those used in personal computers  and the demand and price fluctuations of personal computer components could affect our component costs 
because the purchase of key components involves long lead times  in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products  we may be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet end user demand  or we may hold excess quantities of inventory 
we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and of components with prices that fluctuate significantly 
we cannot assure you that at any given time we will have sufficient inventory to enable us to meet demand which would harm our financial results 
our inventory has represented less than of our total assets and less than of our total revenue for the last two years 
human resources as of december   we employed  full time individuals 
of the  total employees  approximately were in sales and marketing  were in management and administration  were in manufacturing and were in research and development 
of the total number of employees  we had approximately  employees located in us and canadian offices and employees located in international offices including employees based in the united kingdom  the netherlands  germany  japan  france  italy  spain  australia  korea  singapore  brazil  mexico  sweden  india  china and hong kong 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
however  there can be no assurance that collective bargaining  work stoppage or other employment related issues will not arise 

table of contents competition competition in our markets is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
to maintain and improve our competitive position  we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely and cost effective basis new products and features that keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers 
the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our controller solutions include  among others  customer service and support  product reputation  quality  performance  price and product features such as functionality  scalability  ability to interface with oem products and ease of use 
we believe we have generally competed effectively in the past against product offerings of our competitors on the basis of such factors 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to compete effectively in the future based on these or any other competitive factors 
we currently have two main product categories that support color and black and white printing i stand alone print servers which are connected to digital copiers and other peripheral devices and ii embedded and design licensed solutions which are used in digital copiers  desktop laser printers and multifunctional devices 
our primary competitor for the stand alone color servers is creo although creo currently only sells to a single oem  xerox  while efi serves many industry leaders 
our oem customers themselves  as well as peerless and zoran corporation  are the principal competitors for the embedded and design licensed color solutions 
our digital black and white solutions face competition from peerless and our oem customers 
additionally  our oem customers and other copier and printer manufacturers offer internally developed server products or incorporate internally developed embedded solutions or server features into their copiers and printers  thereby eliminating the need for our products 
our market position vis a vis internally developed controllers is small 
we are  however  the largest third party controller vendor 
we believe that our advantages include our continuously advancing technology  time to market  brand recognition  end user loyalty  sizable installed base  number of products supported  price and market knowledge 
a significant disadvantage is our lack of control of the distribution channels 
we do  however  provide a variety of features as well as a unique look and feel to our oems products to differentiate their products from those of their competitors 
our professional printing applications category  which includes our workflow  proofing  print management information software and web submission tools  faces competition from software application vendors that specifically target the printing industry  which are typically small  privately owned companies and from larger vendors  such as heidelberg and sap  who currently offer or are seeking to develop printer focused enterprise resource planning products 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include adoption by significant number of print buyers and printers  product quality and performance  customer service  core technology  product features  price and the value of services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to advance our technology and products or to compete effectively against other companies product offerings and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications and various foreign counterpart patents and applications 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from these pending applications or from any future applications or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
our issued us patents expire between december  and november  our failure to obtain or maintain patent protection may make it easier for our competitors to offer equivalent or superior technology 
in addition  third parties may independently develop similar technology without misappropriation of our trade secrets or breach of other proprietary rights 
any failure by us to take all necessary steps to protect our trade secrets or other intellectual property rights and failure to enforce these rights may have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in our markets

spot on and rip while print trademarks and have applied for registration of certain additional trademarks  in the united states and or in foreign jurisdictions 
we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
any failure by us to properly register or maintain our trademarks or to otherwise take all necessary steps to protect our trademarks may diminish the value associated with our trademarks 
our products include software sold pursuant to shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries  including several in which we operate or sell our products  do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time  litigation may be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of management s attention and other resources 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information

item legal proceedings 
over the past several years  mr 
jan r 
coyle  an individual living in nevada  has repeatedly demanded that we buy technology allegedly invented by his company  kolbet labs 
in december  mr 
coyle threatened to sue us and our customers for allegedly infringing his soon to be issued patent and for allegedly misappropriating his alleged trade secrets 
we believe mr 
coyle s claims are baseless and completely without merit 
therefore  on december   we filed a declaratory relief action in the united states district 
table of contents court for the northern district of california  asking the court to declare that we and our customers have not breached any nondisclosure agreement with mr 
coyle or kolbet labs  nor have we infringed any alleged patent or misappropriated any alleged trade secrets belonging to mr 
coyle or kolbet labs through our sale of fiery  splash or edox print controllers 
we also sought an injunction enjoining both mr 
coyle and kolbet labs from bringing or threatening to bring a lawsuit against us  our suppliers  vendors  customers and users of our products for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets 
on march   the northern district of california court dismissed our complaint citing the court s lack of jurisdiction over mr 
coyle 
we appealed the court s dismissal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit in washington dc  who reversed the dismissal of our case and remanded it back to the northern district of california court 
mr 
coyle and kolbet labs subsequently moved to dismiss our complaint under the declaratory judgment act 
the court granted dismissal on february  we again appealed to the federal circuit  which again reversed and remanded the case on january  finding that our declaratory action comported with the declaratory judgment act 
the federal circuit further noted that the declaratory judgment act was indeed intended for the very situation we faced 
meanwhile  on february   we filed a second declaratory relief action in the northern district of california against mr 
coyle and kolbet labs 
in light of the federal circuit s decision to remand the original action  we dismissed this second action voluntarily and are now pursuing all of our claims in the original action 
on february   mr 
coyle s company  j l electronics  filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the district of nevada alleging patent infringement  breach of non disclosure agreements  misappropriation of trade secrets  violations of federal antitrust law and related causes of action 
we denied all of the allegations and believed this lawsuit to be without merit 
on march   the federal district judge dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over us 
j l electronics appealed the dismissal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on february   the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the dismissal of j l electronics complaint 
j l appealed to the us supreme court who denied their petition on january  although mr 
coyle lost both of his appeals in the nevada action  he caused j l electronics to initiate yet another legal action  this time in arizona 
on may   j l electronics  filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the district of arizona alleging patent infringement  breach of non disclosure agreements  misappropriation of trade secrets  violations of federal antitrust law and related causes of action 
we moved to have that legal action dismissed or transferred to california 
on january   the arizona court ordered the action transferred to the united states court for the district of northern california 
we intend to move the court to combine our original action with the now transferred arizona action 
we believe that the claims in the transferred arizona action are without merit and plan to vigorously pursue dismissal of these claims in the consolidated action 
on june   a securities class action complaint was filed against printcafe software  inc  now our wholly owned subsidiary and certain of printcafe s officers in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania 
the complaint alleges that the defendants violated sections  a and of the securities act of due to allegedly false and misleading statements in connection with printcafe s initial public offering and subsequent press releases 
we acquired printcafe in october on june   an amended complaint was filed in the action adding additional printcafe directors as defendants 
while we believe this lawsuit is without merit  the parties have reached an agreement in principle to fully and finally resolve this litigation  subject to the court s approval of the proposed class action settlement 
we anticipate executing a written stipulation and settlement agreement and jointly moving for the court s preliminary approval of the settlement with the next days 
if preliminarily approved by the court a final fairness hearing will be scheduled accordingly 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation matters  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
however  we have reserved the minimum amount that we could be expected to pay under the two cases discussed above

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
all assumptions  anticipations  expectations and forecasts contained herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
for a discussion of the factors that could impact our results  readers are referred to the section below entitled factors that could adversely affect performance 
overview in  we were able to post an additional four quarters of increased gross margins  due to the favorable impact of increased sales of our software products 
the last quarter marked the th consecutive quarter of improvement in gross margins 
while we expect that our gross margins will stay near the current level  our gross margins are subject to volatility due to product mix 
the year started out with strong sales with each of the first two quarters providing increased revenues from the same two quarters in however  during the third quarter and continuing through the fourth quarter  our revenues declined 
the decline was due to several factors the delayed introduction of the latest version of colorproof  the softness in sales to one of our oem customers  the pushing out of a number of scheduled oem product launches  the lack of new engine copier printer introductions and a continued weakness in production class and mid range devices 
we saw organic growth revenue in excess of amounts reported in previous period  whether by acquirer or acquiree in our professional printing applications for both our internally developed products and the products acquired from printcafe last year 
in our embedded products category we continued to see a shift from our embedded products to our design licensed solutions 
we anticipate that our oem customers will introduce several mid range to high end engines in the second half of and the first half of from which we should benefit 
we are slowly gaining market share in the ultra high end production market and hope to increase our competitiveness in the lower end office printer copier market by offering more office centric feature sets 
our operating expenses grew from of revenue in to of revenue in  excluding the charges we expensed related to our real estate and synthetic leases 
the increased expenses were the result of increased headcount to support our expanding product lines  increased promotional costs and increased accounting and legal fees 
the increased accounting fees are related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and the legal fees relate to litigation support 

table of contents in december we announced that we would cut expenses in underperforming areas 
in january we reduced our headcount by about 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  which are the basis of the following discussion and analysis  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition and contingencies 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are believed to be our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances and other allowances  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  business combinations and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which primarily includes servers  controllers  and design licensed solutions hardware  and software and royalties 
we also receive services and support revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support and training and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
we recognize revenue from the sale of servers  controllers and design licensed solutions when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to the customer s common carrier 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
we license our software under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing and post contract customer support and professional consulting 
revenue is allocated to the support elements of an agreement using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and to the software license 
table of contents portion of the agreements using the residual method 
vsoe is determined based on the price charged when the element is sold separately or for post contract customer support based on substantative renewal rates 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognized when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract typically one to two years  assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we also have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize revenue from the subscriptions ratably over the service period 
any upfront setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances and other allowances and accruals 
to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
to do so  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million as of december  similarly  management must make estimates of potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to measure the need for inventory allowances 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand and the acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventory balance was million  net of allowance of million as of december  we have from time to time set up allowances or accruals for uncertainties related to revenues  for potential unfavorable litigation outcomes and for potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
management bases its estimates for the allowances or accruals on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have maintained a valuation allowance of million as of december  for foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
effective in the third quarter of  we have elected to permanently reinvest unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   we have permanently reinvested million of unremitted earnings 
should these earnings be remitted to the us  the tax on these earnings would be approximately million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
we completed our annual review in the third quarter of  based upon july  
table of contents balances  with no impairment of goodwill indicated as a result of the review 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  no adjustments to the lives of the other intangible assets have been made since the adoption of sfas business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of intangible assets acquired 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption  estimates or other actual results 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs of vacating duplicate facilities 
these costs are based upon estimates made by management and are subject to refinement 
to estimate these costs  we utilize assumptions of the number of employees that will involuntarily terminate employment and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  approximately of our total assets and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  based on our assessment of the factors discussed below  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our japanese subsidiary  efi kk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency and one of our german subsidiaries  best gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency 

table of contents in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of income or as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary

table of contents revenue our revenue in was principally derived from three major categories 
the first category was made up of stand alone servers which connect digital copiers with computer networks 
this category included the fiery  splash  edox  and micropress products 
the second category consisted of embedded desktop controllers  bundled solutions  design licensed solutions and software rips primarily designed for the office market 
the third category consisted of software technology centered around printing workflow  proofing and web submission and job tracking tools 
miscellaneous revenue consisted of spares  engineering services and enterprise solutions  which individually are an insignificant part of the total revenue 
the following is a break down of revenue by category in dollars and volumes as a percentage of total units shipped 
change years ended december  over over revenue servers embedded products professional printing applications miscellaneous total revenue years ended december  volume servers embedded products professional printing applications miscellaneous total volume there are no volumes associated with the professional printing applications revenues 
revenue was million in  compared to million in and million in  which resulted in a increase in versus and an increase in compared to in  the net increase in revenues can be broken down into a million increase from our acquisitions  a million increase from the full year impact of the acquisitions  excluding best gmbh which experienced a million increase  a million increase from non acquisition related professional printing applications and a million decrease in the servers  embedded and miscellaneous categories 
the major factor contributing to the overall higher revenue in over was an increase in the professional printing applications of million  primarily due to acquisitions  and an increase in our embedded category of million 
those increases were offset with a decrease in server sales of million 
in our server category  the decrease in over of million was due to a combination of reduced volumes  partially offset by a increase in the average selling price 
our high end and mid range servers showed a minimal increase in the average selling price  while the average selling price of our low end and black and white servers were stable 
the server category has been impacted by the delay of a server for an existing oem customer  who delayed the launch of their product until and the softness in one of our oem s high end business 
there were a very small number of new copier engines introduced by our oem customers in  and this contributed to our lower server shipments 
we expect our oem customers to launch new products in from which we should benefit  although we cannot guarantee increased 
table of contents shipments 
the decrease in revenue in for servers when compared to was due to decreased shipments in our high end and mid range color servers  partially offset by increased shipments of our low end servers 
during we experienced downward pressure on unit volumes and revenues in the embedded category as products launched in by our oem customers have started to age in the marketplace and end user customers began to anticipate new product launches scheduled throughout while overall shipments in this category declined  there was an increase in the number of design licensed units sold  reflecting the movement from our embedded units by our oem customers to allow them to offer more features on their products  while maintaining price levels with prior products 
the design licensed solutions sell for a lower unit price  putting pressure on our revenue levels  but have a higher gross margin  thereby contributing more per unit to our earnings 
the new product launches in account for the increase in revenues when comparing to in  we expect continued softness in this category until late in the year when incremental products are launched by our oem partners 
with the acquisition of printcafe in we introduced a new product category  professional printing applications 
within this category are the products we acquired from printcafe and best gmbh as well as certain software products that were developed by efi to enhance our server products  such as our graphic arts package and products to optimize the workflow in printshops such as oneflow and balance 
we experienced a steady growth in this category with all of the products in this category showing organic growth of approximately in revenue in compared to the software applications in this category generate higher margins  favorably impacting our margins 
although we do not expect to repeat the growth rate in  we continue to see strong market acceptance of these products and we believe we will experience further incremental growth 
the miscellaneous category of revenue consists of individually insignificant items in our product portfolio  as well as spares 
the decrease in volume when comparing to in this category was attributable to the sale of our ebeam technology in the remaining volume in comes from our docsend product 
we believe that price reductions for all of our products may affect revenues in the future 
we have made and may in the future make price reductions for our products in order to drive demand and remain competitive 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
if we are not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
shipments by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows change years ended december  over over in thousands north america europe japan rest of world total the products in the professional printing applications category  most of which were acquired in late  fueled the increase in revenue in north america from to in europe  the weakened us dollar resulted in a decrease in revenues from to in addition some of the sales in the americas  europe and rest of world shifted to japan as our oem customers purchased our design licensed solutions in japan  and then sold them to their customers 

table of contents new server products  as well as the revenues from our acquisitions  generated the increase in revenue in both north america and europe when comparing to the increase in japan in over is due to the higher number of design licensed solutions as those products are shipped to japan for manufacturing and then redistributed around the world 
as shipments to some of our oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations which in turn sell through to other locations  we believe that non us sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported  though accurate data is difficult to obtain 
we expect that non us sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
substantially all of the revenue for and and the majority of the revenue for was attributable to sales of products through our oem channels with such customers as canon  epson  fuji xerox  ibm  hewlett packard  kodak danka business systems  konica minolta  oc  ricoh  sharp  toshiba  xerox and others 
the customers that individually accounted for more than of our revenues were canon  konica minolta minolta only  in and xerox 
together these customers accounted for of our revenues in  in and in the decrease to from is the result of our increased software sales  which are sold to more customers than our traditional server business 
however  in the event that any of the oem relationships are scaled back or discontinued  we could still experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  no assurance can be given that our relationships with these oem customers will continue 
we continue to work on the development of products utilizing our proprietary architecture and other products and intend to continue to introduce new generations of server and controller products and other new product lines with current and new oems in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of new  current or future products will be successful 
gross margins our gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
the basis point increase in gross margin from to resulted primarily from an increase in software sales compared to the prior year principally due to our acquisitions and the migration of embedded controller sales to design license sales for certain of our products 
the basis point increase in gross margin from to from to was due to the introduction of additional digital printing engines for the commercial print markets  the conversion of more new office products to the design licensed model and increased software sales  including the products from our acquisitions 
we cannot predict the impact of each of these  or other factors  on future gross margin results 
our print servers as well as our embedded desktop controllers are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
if our third party manufacturers cannot obtain the necessary components at favorable prices we could experience an increase in our product costs 
we do purchase certain parts directly  including processors  memory  certain asics and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which we license from adobe systems  inc in general  we believe that the current gross margin levels are sustainable if our product mix remains stable 
if our product mix changes significantly  our gross margins will fluctuate 
in addition  gross margins can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on our current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of our product transitions and new products  competition and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  gross margins may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  if we are pressured to reduce prices  gross margins for our products could be lower 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and increased by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue amounted to  and for  and  respectively 
of the million increase in compared to  the largest increase came from the acquisitions made in and with the next largest amount coming from the million real estate related charges 
less significant additional increases were from increased payroll expenses  additional trade show expenses  accounting and consulting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox and additional legal costs offset with a decrease of million related to the amortization of identified intangibles and other acquisition related charges 
we are unable to clearly define the costs associated with our and acquisitions as the acquired companies were merged into our existing operations and not maintained as stand alone businesses 
the acquisition of three companies in accounted for nearly the entire increase between and before the amortization of identifiable intangibles and other acquisition related charges 
in an effort to improve our profitability we made reductions in our workforce in january and expect that the full effect of those reductions will be reflected in our earnings in the second quarter of the components of operating expenses are detailed below 
research and development expenses for research and development consist primarily of personnel related and facility expenses and  to a lesser extent  consulting  depreciation and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in our acquisitions on an annualized basis account for the majority of the million increase in research and development expenses in when compared to  while our acquisition accounted for a small additional amount 
as the acquired companies were not maintained as stand alone businesses  the amounts in attributed to acquisitions cannot be accurately determined 
of the million or increase in absolute dollars from to  the majority is attributable to the increased head count from our acquisition of three companies 
the remaining increase came from increased payroll costs 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our continued success and intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and product development efforts 
we expect that our research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of revenue  even though we have reduced our research and development staff in early as part of our announced reduction in workforce 
as part of our cost containment practices  we review all projects on a periodic basis for estimated return on investment 
those projects that do not meet certain criteria are changed or halted 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel related expenses  costs for trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  japan and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in we estimate the increase from to related to acqusitions on an annualized basis was over half of the total increase with the increase related to our acquisition contributing a small additional amount 
the remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses in primarily came from our participation in drupa  a leading print industry exposition which occurs every four years  our sponsorship of connect  the annual conference for users of our print mis software  and our participation in other trade shows 
included in the increases are the effects of the weakening us dollar  which has led to higher us dollar costs for our international sales offices 
while costs in the local currency have generally remained constant  during the translated us dollar costs have increased 
our acquisitions in led to increased head count in the sales and marketing group and accounted for over half of the increase in sales 
table of contents and marketing expenses in the remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses in came from salary increases and increased participation in trade shows  offset by decreased facility costs 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue as we continue to actively promote our products  launch new products and services  and continue to build our sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and asia pacific  and as we grow our software solutions and other new product lines which require greater sales and marketing support from us 
we also expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro or other currencies  sales and marketing expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
approximately of our sales and marketing expenses are from our foreign offices 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and facility costs  professional fees and other costs associated with public companies 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in general and administrative expenses between and principally consists of from the impact of our acquistions on an annualized basis  increased costs of million associated with complying with new regulations related to sox  and increased legal costs related to various litigation matters 
the relatively flat general and administrative expenses between and are the result of decreased facility costs offset with an increase in payroll costs and the addition of general and administrative expenses related to our acquisitions 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue due to additional costs that will be incurred for compliance with sox  and in order to support our efforts to grow our business in future periods 
we also expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro or other currencies  general and administrative expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
approximately of our general and administrative expenses are from our foreign offices 
real estate related charges we expensed million related to our real estate in a valuation of the building located at velocity way was completed in as part of our amended financing arrangement signed in september for that building 
under the original lease of million  we guaranteed the lessor an residual value in the building upon the termination of the original lease 
the valuation provided a value of approximately million for the building  and we paid the lessor million and recorded a one time loss associated with the original lease in september in addition  during the quarter ended september   we wrote off million of capitalized lease costs associated with the original lease 
we also wrote off million of capitalized costs associated with other development activity determined to have no remaining validity related to land purchased in within our foster city campus 
amortization of identifiable intangibles and other acquisition related charges amortization of identifiable intangibles was million or approximately of revenue in  while the acquisition related charge for the write off of in process research and development was million 
amortization of identifiable intangibles  was million or of revenue in  while the acquisition related charge for the write off of in process research and development was million or of revenue for the acquisition of two companies in the fourth quarter of and one company in the first quarter of account for the increase in amortization expense 
the in process research and development costs related to printcafe and t r systems  acquired in  contributed million of the million in amortization of identifiable intangibles was million or of revenue in since the adoption of sfas in january we have not identified any impairment of goodwill upon completion of the annual impairment tests performed upon the july balances in and 
table of contents interest and other income interest income was million in and increased by from million in  reflecting rising interest rates 
the decrease in of million in interest income from is due to a lower return on investments as a result of decreasing market interest rates throughout the decline in interest income due to lower interest rates was offset in part by an increase in the investment balance from additional cash generated from operations and the proceeds from our convertible debenture offering in june  less cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock 
realized gains on short term investments account for million and million of other income in and  respectively 
in  the realized gains on short term investments were million while the losses on foreign currency translations were million 
the remaining million loss in was related to losses from our investment in a venture capital fund 
interest expense interest expense and debt issuance costs related to the convertible debentures was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense in was related to the bonds associated with the foster city property and was not material 
litigation settlement income charges  net in and we received litigation settlement income of million and million  respectively  net of related legal expenses  from the settlement of litigation protecting our intellectual property 
litigation settlement expenses in other income in consist of the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit for million  including legal fees and other related costs 
while there has been no change in our view that the lawsuit had no merit  we determined that settlement of the lawsuit was in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders 
loss on equity investment in june we exercised an option granted by printcafe to purchase approximately million shares of printcafe stock  representing approximately a ownership in printcafe  which we accounted for as an available for sale equity security 
in october  we acquired the remaining interest in printcafe 
we were required under generally accepted accounting principles gaap to report the investment in printcafe on an equity basis from the time of the option exercise through the date that we acquired of the outstanding shares of printcafe 
a million non cash charge was recorded as a result of the change to equity method of accounting 
gain on sale of product line we recognized approximately million from the sale of our unimobile product line  consisting of a customer base  research and development and sales employees  and intangible assets 
benefit from provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in  in and in during the third quarter of  the tax provision reflected the one time effect of the resolution of the internal revenue service irs examination of our federal income tax returns filed for through as a result of the settlement reached with the irs for these years  we were required to remit million in tax deficiencies and related interest and we utilized million in credit carry forwards available to offset income taxes payable in future periods 
in addition and as a result of such settlement  we adjusted our tax accruals related to the audit years for million 
in all years presented  we benefited from tax exempt interest income and research and development credits 
we also benefited from foreign sales in and our rate increased in due to the in process research and development write off related to the ads acquisition and in due to similar 
table of contents write offs related to the printcafe and t r systems acquisitions 
our rate also increased in as a result of the loss on our pro rata share of printcafe s losses prior to the completion of the of the acquisition 
our rate was also negatively impacted in by taxes provided on foreign earnings 
also  during the third quarter of  we evaluated the business objectives and financial requirements of our domestic and international operations and determined that we intend to permanently reinvest million of unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries reported for the periods through therefore  the tax provision in the third quarter of also reflects a benefit of million from the reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax liability associated with those earnings 
the net impact of these events in is a net income tax benefit of million 
excluding this net income tax benefit  our effective tax rate for would have been 
the american jobs creation act of  the act  was enacted on october  the act contains changes to the internal revenue code that may impact efi and our accounting for income taxes 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the act s impact 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the implementation of the pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
sfas revised on december   fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt sfas r on july  as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
eitf in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
additionally  eitf issue no 
includes new disclosure 
table of contents requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our year ended december  we will evaluate the effect  if any  of eitf when final guidance is released 
fsp fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for foreign earnings repatriation with the american jobs creation act of fsp  provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  on recording the potential income tax liability resulting from a repatriation pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act was signed into law on october  fsp allows companies additional time to evaluate the impact of any repatriation and the resulting tax liability made pursuant to the act 
the company is still evaluating the impact of the act s repatriation provisions 
as a result  the company has not adjusted its tax expense to reflect the impact of the repatriation provisions 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities overview we ended with cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million  as compared to million at the end of the increase of million was from the receipt of approximately million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock purchase plans and options  as well as cash collections from our customers and the timing of payment of our liabilities 
these increases were offset with our use of million of cash to repurchase common stock and million to acquire ads technology 
a more detailed discussion of changes in our liquidity follows 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in  and was primarily the result of our net income of million  million and million  respectively  which is adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  acquired in process research and development  deferred income taxes  stock compensation and changes in various assets and liabilities such as accounts payable  accounts receivable and other current assets 
our historical and primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable 
dsos were days  days  and days at december   and we calculate accounts receivable dso on a gross basis by dividing the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in quarterly revenue and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our accounts receivable dso has been trending upward and we expect this trend may continue 
for the past three years our revenue was generated by sales of our server products  which are typically invoiced with net days terms 
with our acquisitions we added software offerings to our product lineup  a portion of 
table of contents which are invoiced with terms greater than days  and it is possible that as the revenue from those offerings increase our accounts receivable dso will increase 
our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities 
in  the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities reduced our cash flows by approximately million 
payments for taxes reduced our operating cash flows by million 
our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the cause of the decrease in working capital of approximately million is principally related to the transfer of million of cash to a long term collateral account and the payment of million to the lessor under the terms of one of our synthetic leases  offset in part by the decrease in current liabilities of million from to and the collection of cash from our customers 
current liabilities decreased due to the reduction in taxes payable resulting from the settlement of an irs audit 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash and internally generated funds 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue or what the effect on our business might be from the competitive environment in which we operate 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
investing activities a summary of our investing activities at december   and follows 
the detail of these line items can be seen in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
activity in millions cash payments for acquisitions cash payments for property and equipment  net of proceeds from sales net proceeds purchases of investments in marketable securities proceeds from cash payments for restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term short term investments purchases of restricted investments for collateral other items net cash used in provided by investing activities acquisitions in  we paid cash for our acquisition of ads technology in the amount of million 
we purchased ads technology to enhance our software offerings to the copier dealer channels 
we acquired best gmbh for million in cash in january and printcafe software for a combination of shares of our common stock and million in cash in october to add products to our offerings for the professional print industry 
we also purchased t r systems for million in cash in november for their server technology and web based storefront software 
we may buy or make investments in complementary companies  products and technologies 
our available cash and equity may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 

table of contents property and equipment we purchased million of equipment during  including costs related to the consolidation of our three arizona offices 
purchases of property and equipment were million in and million in our property and equipment additions have been funded from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business and our business outlook 
investments we received net proceeds from our marketable securities in of million 
in and we made purchases net of sales maturities of our marketable securities of million and million  respectively 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in corporate bonds and us government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during the restrictions on certain cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were lifted when the synthetic lease requiring the pledged accounts expired 
approximately million in cash equivalents and short term investments were transferred to investment accounts that carried no restrictions 
collateral accounts in connection with the synthetic leases for our foster city offices  we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts 
at december  there was one account which carried a balance of million dollars for the velocity way building 
in september we withdrew million to reimburse the lessor for the loss in value of that building 
in july we negotiated a new lease for the building located at velocity way  and per provisions in that lease  placed million in cash in a second libor based interest bearing account 
we now have million in collateral accounts 
for further information on these transactions please see the discussion at off balance sheet financing 
financing activities the primary use of funds for financing activities in was the use of million of cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our programs to repurchase our common stock 
historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
if our stock price rises  more employees options are in the money in their options  and the employees are more likely to exercise their options  which results in cash to us 
if our stock price decreases  more of our employees options are out of the money or under water  and therefore  the employees are not able to exercise options  which results in no cash received by us 
the decrease in cash proceeds from the exercise of 
table of contents stock options and employee stock purchase plans from to was primarily the result of the lower market prices for our common stock 
our employee stock purchase plan has had a high participation rate historically  and has generated million  million and million in  and we do not know if participation will continue at these levels if we amend our plan to eliminate any look back for purchase plan prices in response to the adoption of fas r 
in  we received net proceeds from the issuance of our senior convertible debentures in the amount of million  net of issuance costs 
we used million of the proceeds from this offering to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
the remaining proceeds were placed in our short term investment accounts 
the synthetic lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
under fin  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantees have no material value as of december  other commitments our inventory consists primarily of memory subsystems  processors and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially fixed assets would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventory we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our sub contract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate the sub contract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the accrued liability 
legal proceedings in addition to the matters discussed under item  legal proceedings  we are involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of our business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations capital purchase obligations interest payments on senior convertible debentures long term debt obligations total 
table of contents lease obligations related to the principal corporate facilities are estimated and are based on current market interest rates libor 
see off balance sheet financing below see off balance sheet financing below 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our senior convertible debentures total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on efi and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet financing synthetic lease arrangements we are a party to two synthetic leases the lease and the lease  together leases covering our foster city facilities located at and velocity way  foster city  california 
these leases provide a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
both leases expire in july we may  at our option  purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the leases for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities million for the lease and million for the lease 
we have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the buildings equal to of their funding of the respective leases 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of december  we are liable to the lessor for the financed amount of the buildings if we default on our covenants 
we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantees under the leases and believe that there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
the funds pledged under the leases million for the lease and million for the lease at december  for a total of million are in libor based interest bearing accounts and are restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
in conjunction with the leases  we have entered into separate ground leases with the lessor for approximately years 
we are treated as the owner of these buildings for federal income tax purposes 
as part of the september amended financing arrangement for the lease  we completed a valuation of the building located at velocity way 
under the original financing agreement  we guaranteed the lessor upon termination of the original lease an residual value in the building which cost million to construct 
the valuation provided a value of approximately million  and we recorded a one time loss of million associated with the original lease 
in addition  we took a non cash charge of million for capitalized costs associated with the financial arrangement 

table of contents effective july   we applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin r for variable interest entities vies 
we have evaluated our synthetic lease agreements to determine if the arrangements qualify as variable interest entities under fin r 
we have determined that the synthetic lease agreements do qualify as vies  however  because we are not the primary beneficiary under fin r we are not required to consolidate the vies in our financial statements

table of contents factors that could adversely affect performance and financial results we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem customers and the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated by sales of our printer and copier related products to a relatively small number of oems 
for example  canon  xerox and konica minolta each contributed over of our revenues for the year ended december  and together accounted for approximately of those revenues 
during the fiscal year ended december   these same three customers each contributed over of our revenues and together accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year 
because sales of our printer and copier related products constitute a significant portion of our revenues and there are a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of oem customers for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
accordingly  if we lose or experience reduced sales to an important oem customer  we will have difficulty replacing the revenue traditionally generated from such customer with sales to new or existing oem customers and our revenues will likely decline significantly 
because of our recent acquisitions we now sell some of our products directly to distributors and to the end user 
if we are unable to effectively manage a direct sales force  revenues could decline 
we have traditionally sold our products to our oem customers  who in turn sold the product to the end user 
accordingly  in the past  our marketing and sales efforts focused on manufacturers and distributors of the manufacturers equipment  not on the end user of the product 
consequently  we have limited experience developing and managing a direct sales force or marketing products and services directly to the end user 
the professional printing applications and enterprise solutions that we acquired in our purchase of printcafe and ads are sold directly to the end user 
if we are unable to successfully develop  expand and manage our direct sales force or develop a marketing program that effectively reaches the end users  we are likely to see a decline in revenues from those products and the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may be reduced or not materialize 
we do not typically have long term purchase contracts with our customers and our customers have in the past and could at any time in the future  reduce or cease purchasing products from us  harming our operating results and business 
with the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations  we typically do not have long term volume purchase contracts with our customers  including canon  xerox and konica minolta and they are not obligated to purchase products from us 
accordingly  our customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether 
in the past  some of our oem customers have elected to develop products on their own  rather than purchase our products and we expect that customers will continue to make such elections in the future 
in addition  since our oem customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell  any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers and any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general  is likely to harm our results of operations 
for example  several of our customers have in the past experienced serious financial difficulties which led to a decline in sales of our products to these customers 
if any significant customers should face such difficulties in the future  our operating results could be harmed through  among other things  decreased sales volumes and write offs of accounts receivables and inventory related to products we have manufactured for these customers products 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in advance based on projected sales levels and margins  sales forecasts from our oem customers and product development programs 
a substantial portion of our backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less and our customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times for product they have ordered from us without penalty 
accordingly  if sales to our oem customers are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall in revenues on operating results may be increased by our inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for this shortfall 

table of contents we rely on our oem customers to develop and sell products incorporating our technologies and if they fail to successfully develop and sell these products  or curtail or cease the use of our technologies in their products  our business will be harmed 
we rely upon our oem customers to develop new products  applications and product enhancements utilizing our technologies in a timely and cost effective manner 
our continued success depends upon the ability of these oem customers to utilize our technologies while meeting changing end user customer needs and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
however  we cannot assure you that our oem customers will effectively meet these requirements 
these oem customers  who are not within our control  are generally not obligated to purchase products from us and we cannot assure you that they will continue to carry our products 
for example  our oem customers have incorporated into their products the technologies of other companies in addition to  or instead of  our technologies and will likely continue to do so in the future 
if our oem customers do not effectively market products containing our technologies  our revenue will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our oem customers work closely with us to develop products that are specific to each oem customer s copiers and printers 
many of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development  quality testing  marketing and other tasks with our oem customers 
we cannot control our oem customers development efforts or the timing of these efforts and coordinating with our oem customers may cause delays in our own product development efforts that are outside of our control 
if our oem customers delay the release of their product due to factors outside our control  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot meet our oem customers product needs for their specific copiers and printers  as well as successfully manage the additional engineering and support effort and other risks associated with such a wide range of products 
ongoing economic uncertainty has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our business 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends significantly on the overall demand for information technology products such as ours that enable printing of digital data 
delays or reductions in information technology spending which has occurred since  has and could continue to cause a decline in demand for our products and services and consequently has and may continue to harm our business  operating results  financial condition  prospects and stock price 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors  which could adversely affect our stock price 
stock prices of high technology companies such as ours tend to be volatile and are subject to broad fluctuation  including due to variations in operating results and  consequently  fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
factors that have caused our operating results and share price to fluctuate in the past and that may cause future fluctuations include varying demand for our products  due to seasonality  oem customer product development and marketing efforts  oem customer financial and operational condition and general economic conditions  shifts in customer demand to lower cost products  success and timing of new product introductions by us and our oem customers and the performance of our products generally  volatility in foreign exchange rates  changes in interest rates and availability of bank or financing credit to consumers of digital copiers and printers  price reductions by us and our competitors  which may be exacerbated by competitive pressures caused by economic conditions generally  delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders or projects  
table of contents availability of key components  including possible delays in deliveries from suppliers  the performance of third party manufacturers and the status of our relationships with our key suppliers  potential excess or shortage of employees and location of research and development centers  changes in our product mix such as shifts from higher revenue products to lower revenue products dependent on higher sales volumes  costs associated with complying with any applicable governmental regulations  including substantial costs related to compliance with sox  acquisitions and integration of new businesses  changes in our business model related to the migration of embedded products to a design licensed model  costs related to the entry into new markets  such as commercial printing and office equipment service automation  general economic conditions  and other risks described herein 
we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be harmed 
our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological changes 
we compete against a number of other suppliers of imaging products and technologies  including our oem customers themselves 
although we attempt to develop and support innovative products that end customers demand  products or technologies developed by competing suppliers  including our own oem customers  could render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
while many of our oem customers incorporate our technologies into their end products on an exclusive basis  we do not have any formal agreements that prevent these oem customers from offering alternative products that do not incorporate our technologies 
if  as has occurred in the past  an oem customer offers products from alternative suppliers instead of  or in addition to products incorporating our technologies  our market share could decrease  which would likely reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  many oems in the printer and copier industry  including most of our oem customers  internally develop and sell products that compete directly with our current products 
these oems have significant investments in their existing solutions and have substantial resources that may enable them to develop or improve  more quickly than us  technologies similar to ours that are compatible with their own products 
our oem customers have in the past marketed and likely will continue in the future to market  their own internal technologies and solutions in addition to ours  even when their technologies and solutions are less advanced  have lower performance or cost more than our products 
given the significant financial  marketing and other resources of our larger oem customers and other significant oems in the imaging industry who are not our customers  we may not be able to successfully compete against similar products developed internally by these oems  particularly in the black and white and embedded color product markets where price competition is most intense and where we experience pressure on our margins 
if we cannot compete successfully against the oems internally developed products  we will lose sales and market share in those areas where the oems choose to compete and our business will be harmed 
demand for technology  in general  and for products containing our technology that enable black and white and color printing of digital data has decreased over the past three years and could decrease in the future  adversely affecting our sales revenue 
our products are primarily targeted at enabling the printing of black and white and color digital data 
demand for networked printers and copiers containing our technology decreased over the past several years due principally to the global economic downturn 
if demand for digital printing products and services 
table of contents containing our technology were to continue to decline  or if the demand for our oem customers specific printers or copiers for which our products are designed were to continue to decline  our revenue would likely decrease 
our products are combined with products  such as digital printers and copiers  which are large capital expenditures as well as discretionary purchase items for the end customer 
in difficult economic times such as we have recently experienced  spending on information technology typically decreases 
as the products in which our products are incorporated are of a more discretionary nature than many other technology products  we may be more adversely impacted by deteriorating general economic conditions than other technology firms outside of our market 
the decrease in demand for our products has harmed and could  in the future  continue to harm our results of operations and we do not know whether demand for our products or our customers products will increase or improve from current levels 
if we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees  we may not be able to develop products or meet demand for our products in a timely fashion 
we depend upon skilled employees  such as software and hardware engineers  quality assurance engineers and other technical professionals with specialized skills 
we are headquartered in the silicon valley where competition has historically been intense among companies to hire engineering and technical professionals 
in times of professional labor imbalances  it has in the past and is likely in the future to be difficult for us to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and for us to retain these people 
there are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the silicon valley that may try to hire our employees 
the movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees 
if we do not offer competitive compensation  we may not be able to recruit or retain employees 
we offer a broad based equity compensation plan based on granting options and shares of common stock from stockholder approved plans in order to be competitive in the labor market 
if stockholders do not approve additional shares for these plans or new plans for future grants when necessary to enable us to offer compensation competitive with those offered by other companies seeking the same employees  it may be difficult for us to hire and retain skilled employees 
if we cannot successfully hire and retain employees  we may not be able to develop products or to meet demand for our products in a timely fashion and our results of operations may be harmed 
recent and proposed regulations related to equity incentives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
since our inception  we have used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee retention packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage employees to remain with our company 
the financial accounting standards board has announced changes to us gaap that  when implemented  will require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and issuances of stock under employee stock purchase plans  or espps 
this regulation could negatively impact our gaap earnings 
for example  recording a charge for employee stock options under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation would have reduced net income by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased costs  change our equity incentive strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to develop new products  or execute product introductions on a timely basis  our future revenue and operating results may be harmed 
our operating results depend to a significant extent on continual improvement of our existing products and technologies and rapid innovation of new products and technologies by us 
our success depends not only on our ability to predict future requirements  but also to successfully develop and introduce new products that address end user needs or add additional functionality that end users will demand 
any delays in the launch or 
table of contents availability of new products we are planning which has occurred in the current year could harm our financial results 
during transitions from existing products to new products  customers may delay or cancel orders for existing products 
our results of operations may be harmed if we cannot successfully manage product transitions or provide adequate availability of products after they have been introduced 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance performance and functionality of our products  including product lines different than our fiery  splash  micropress and edox servers and embedded controllers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and introduce new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products 
also  when we decide to develop new products  our research and development expenses generally increase in the short term without a corresponding increase in revenue  which can harm our operating results 
finally  we cannot assure you that products and technologies developed by our own customers and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we enter new markets or distribution channels this could result in higher operating expenses that may not be offset by increased revenue 
we continue to explore opportunities to develop product lines different from our current servers and embedded controllers  such as the proofing and print management software  document scanning solutions  prepress software solutions and web submission tools  among others 
we expect to continue to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these and additional new products and services  which will increase our operating expenses 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services or if we will generate sufficient revenues from these activities to offset the additional operating expenses we incur 
in addition  even if we are able to introduce new products or services  if customers do not accept these new products or services or if we are not able to price such products or services competitively  our operating results will likely suffer 
we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products 
most of our current products include software that we must license from adobe 
specifically  we are required to obtain separate licenses from adobe for the right to use adobe postscript software in each type of copier or printer used with a fiery server or controller 
although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript software when required  adobe is not required to and we cannot be certain that adobe will  grant future licenses to adobe postscript software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  in order to obtain licenses from adobe  adobe requires that we obtain from them quality assurance approvals for our products that use adobe software 
although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurances from adobe  we cannot be certain adobe will grant us such approvals in the future 
if adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals  if the adobe licenses are terminated  or if our relationship with adobe is otherwise materially impaired  we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate adobe postscript software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
in some products we have introduced internally developed substitute software that does not require any license from adobe 
the costs to continue to develop software internally could increase our research and development expenditures and we may not be able to recapture those costs through increased sales 
we depend upon a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products and the loss of any of these suppliers could adversely affect our business 
certain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these include processors from intel and other related semiconductor components 
we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our component suppliers and conduct our business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis 
because the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times  in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products  we have been in the past and may in the future be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet oem customer or end user demand 
in addition  as has occurred in the past  in the event that anticipated demand does not 
table of contents materialize  we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete 
in order to meet projected demand  we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we are subject to a risk of inventory obsolescence  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  the market prices and availability of certain components  particularly memory and intel designed components  which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products  have fluctuated significantly in the past 
such fluctuations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including a reduction in gross margins 
we are dependent on a limited number of sub contractors  with whom we do not have long term contracts  to manufacture and deliver products to our customers and the loss of any of these sub contractors could adversely affect our business 
we subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products and we do not have long term agreements with these sub contractors 
we rely on the ability of our sub contractors to produce products to be sold to our customers and while we closely monitor our sub contractors performance we cannot assure you that such sub contractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner 
the weakened economy has led to the dissolution  bankruptcy or consolidation of some of the sub contractors who are able to manufacture our products  decreasing the available number of sub contractors 
if the available number of sub contractors continues to decrease  it is possible that we will not be able to secure appropriate sub contractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner or at all  particularly if demand for our products increases  or if we lose one or more of our current sub contractors 
fewer sub contractors may also reduce our negotiating leverage regarding product costs 
difficulties experienced by our sub contractors  including financial problems and the inability to make or ship our products or fix quality assurance problems  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we decide to change sub contractors  we could experience delays in setting up new sub contractors which would result in delay in delivery of our products and potentially the cancellation of orders for our products 
a high concentration of our products is manufactured at a single sub contractor location  sanmina sci in colorado 
should sanmina sci experience any inability or unwillingness to manufacture or deliver product from this location our business  financial condition and operations could be harmed 
since we do not maintain long term agreements with our sub contractors  any of our sub contractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit such sub contractors from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability of such sub contractor from filling our orders in a timely manner 
in such event  we may not be able to find suitable replacement sub contractors and our business  financial condition and operations would likely be harmed 
seasonal purchasing patterns of our oem customers have historically caused lower fourth and first quarter revenue from sales of our servers and embedded products  which may negatively impact our results of operations 
our results of operations have typically followed a seasonal pattern reflecting the buying patterns of our large oem customers 
in the fiscal quarter completed december  and in past fiscal fourth quarters the quarter ending december our results have been adversely affected because some or all of our oem customers decrease  or otherwise delay  fourth quarter orders 
over the past several years our oem customers have lowered channel inventories throughout the year  causing this effect to shift more from the fourth quarter into the first quarter  when our oem customers typically have lower sales of their own products 
in addition  the first fiscal quarter traditionally has been a weaker quarter because our oem customers focus on training their sales forces and have reduced sales to their customers 
the primary reasons for these seasonal patterns are our oem customers have historically sought to minimize year end inventory investment including the reduction in demand following introductory channel fill purchases  the timing of new product releases and training by our oem customers in the first and fourth quarters  and 
table of contents certain of our oem customers have typically achieved their yearly sales targets before year end and consequently delayed further purchases into the next fiscal year we do not know when our customers reach these sales targets as they generally do not disclose them to us 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on such comparisons to predict our future performance 
we anticipate that future operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the continuation or changes in this seasonal demand pattern 
we may make acquisitions that are dilutive to existing stockholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources 
as part of this effort  we have in the past made  and will continue to make  acquisitions of other companies or other companies assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as if we issue equity securities in connection with an acquisition  the issuance will generally be dilutive to our existing stockholders  alternatively  acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash will reduce our cash reserves  difficulties in integration of operations  employees  technologies  or products and the related diversion of management time and effort to accomplish successful integration  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions  possible write downs of impaired assets  potential loss of key employees  particularly management  of the acquired company  possible expense overruns  an adverse reaction by customers  suppliers or partners of the acquired company or us  the risk of changes in ratings by stock analysts  potential litigation surrounding transactions  the inability to protect or secure technology rights  and an increase in operating costs 
acquisitions are inherently risky and we cannot assure you that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business  operating results  financial condition  or stock price 
we face risks from our international operations and from currency fluctuations 
approximately  and of our revenue from the sale of products for the years ended december   and  respectively  came from sales outside north america  primarily to europe and japan 
we expect that sales outside north america will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations 
these risks include the regulatory requirements of foreign governments which may apply to our products  as well as requirements for export licenses which may be required for the export of certain technologies 
the necessary export licenses may be delayed or difficult to obtain  which could cause a delay in our international sales and hurt our product revenue 
other risks include trade protection measures  natural disasters and political or economic conditions in a specific country or region 
given the significance of our non us sales to our total product revenue  we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  the euro and other major european currencies and 
table of contents numerous southeast asian currencies 
we typically invoice our customers in us dollars and this may result in our products becoming more expensive in the local currency of our customers  thereby reducing our ability to sell our products 
when we do invoice our customers in local currencies  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the currency of the invoice and the us dollar 
in january  we acquired best gmbh  whose sales are principally denominated in the euro 
sales from this subsidiary increase our exposure to currency fluctuations 
in addition  we have a substantial number of international employees which creates material operating costs denominated in foreign currencies 
in europe  where we have a significant presence  our sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses have risen in part due to the weakened us dollar 
our efforts to reduce the risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and licensing and cross licensing arrangements to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
we have patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending applications or from any future applications  or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot be certain that any patents that have been or may in the future be issued to us  or which we license from third parties  or any other of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents  licenses or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information 
litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation 
third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights 
such claims have in the past resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation and could do so in the future 
such claims and any related litigation  whether or not we are successful in the litigation  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we cannot assure you that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
our products may contain defects which are not discovered until after shipping 
our products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others 
our products may contain undetected errors and we have in the past discovered software and hardware errors in certain of our products after their introduction  resulting in warranty expense and other expenses incurred in connection with rectifying such errors 
errors could be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipments  and any such errors could result in a loss or delay in market acceptance of such products and thus harm our reputation and revenues 
in addition  errors in our products including errors in licensed third party software detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and in additional expense to correct the errors  which could harm our operating results 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues 
maintaining the security of our software and hardware products is an issue of critical importance to our customers and for us 
there are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses  worms and other 
table of contents malicious software programs that could attack our products 
although we take preventative measures to protect our products  and we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events  these procedures may not be sufficient to mitigate damage to our products 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products  to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitive products 
customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack  which could delay purchases of our products 
any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenues 
system failures or system unavailability could harm our business 
we rely on our network infrastructure  internal technology systems and our internal and external websites for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
our hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from malicious code released into the public internet through recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs 
these systems are also subject to acts of vandalism and to potential disruption by actions or inactions of third parties 
any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes  floods or other natural disasters and public health risks 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development facilities  are located in the san francisco bay area  an area known for seismic activity 
this area has also experienced flooding in the past 
in addition  many of the components necessary to supply our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas including the san francisco bay area  taiwan and japan and are therefore subject to risk from natural disasters 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  flood  tsunami or typhoon  could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our employees  suppliers and customers are located worldwide 
we face the risk that our employees  suppliers  or customers  either through travel or contact with other individuals  could become exposed to contagious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars 
in addition  governments in those regions have from time to time imposed quarantines and taken other actions in response to contagious diseases that could affect our operations 
if a significant number of employees  suppliers  or customers were unable to fulfill their obligations  due to contagious diseases  actions taken in response to contagious diseases  or other reasons  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
the value of our investment portfolio will decrease if interest rates increase 
we have an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available for sale securities 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years  however  we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations and this may cause our investment portfolio to decrease in value 
our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the twelve month period ended december   the price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results  announcements of our historical or anticipated operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  
table of contents announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments  announcements by our customers regarding their businesses or the products in which our products are included  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  changes in general economic conditions  terrorist attacks and the effects of military engagements  natural disasters changes in the rating of our debentures or other securities  and changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time to time and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of high technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
there can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made at the best possible price 
the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock 
additionally  we are permitted and could discontinue our stock repurchase program at any time and any such discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
under new regulations required by sox  an adverse opinion on internal controls over financial reporting could be issued by our independent registered public accounting firm  and this could have a negative impact on our stock price 
section of sox requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and assess on an on going basis the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
our independent registered public accounting firm are required to attest audit both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls and management s assessment of the design and the effectiveness of its internal controls 
although no known material weaknesses exist at this time  it is possible that material weaknesses may be found in the future 
if we are unable to remediate the weaknesses  the independent registered public accounting firm would be required to issue an adverse opinion on our internal controls 
because opinions on internal controls have not been required in the past  it is uncertain what impact an adverse opinion would have upon our stock price 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
in june  we issued million in convertible senior debentures due in during the period the debentures are outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the debentures of approximately million per year in interest payments  payable semi annually 
in addition  beginning june   we could be required to pay contingent interest of if during any six month period from june to november and december to may  the average market price of the debentures for the five trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant six month period equals or more of the principal amount of the debentures 

table of contents our debt service obligations related to the debentures include the following redemption and repurchase terms that could also affect our cash position on or after june   we may redeem the debentures for cash at any time as a whole  or from time to time in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debenture to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  on june  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of those debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to  but not including  the date of repurchase in cash  and a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to june  at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash 
if we issue other debt securities in the future  our debt service obligations will increase 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce  curtail or terminate other activities of our business 
we may add lines of credit and obtain other long term debt and mortgage financing to finance capital expenditures in the future 
our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  as we are required to make interest payments and maintain compliance with financial covenants contained in the debentures regardless of such external conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing due to covenants contained in the debentures and the existing leverage evidenced by the debentures  require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
our senior debentures issued in june are convertible into common stock under certain conditions 
if either we or the debt holders convert the debentures into common stock our basic earnings per share could decrease 
in june  we issued million in senior convertible debentures due in the debentures are convertible into our shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures which represents a conversion price of approximately per share under certain conditions and subject to certain adjustments 
holders may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter after september   if the sale price of our common stock for at least consecutive trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds of the conversion price on that th trading day  during any five consecutive trading day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period the debenture measurement period in which the average trading price for the debentures during that debenture measurement period was less than of the average conversion value for the debentures during such period  however  the debentures may not be converted after june  if on 
table of contents any trading day during such debenture measurement period the closing sale price of shares of our common stock was between the then current conversion price on the debentures and of the then conversion price of the debentures  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as defined in the indenture  or if we have called the debentures for redemption 
on june  and  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of those debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price on those dates in cash  in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to june  at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash  shares of our common stock  or if we have been acquired by another company and we are not the surviving corporation  shares of common stock  ordinary shares or american depositary shares of the surviving corporation  or a combination of cash and stock 
any time that we calculate earnings per share on a diluted basis  we must consider whether the  shares that could be issued under our debentures are dilutive to our earnings 
if they are dilutive  after adjusting net income for the after tax effect of interest and other debt related costs  we must then present our diluted earnings on an if converted basis 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps over a twelve month time horizon 
this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon valuation of securities valuation of securities given an interest rate no change given an interest rate decrease of basis in interest increase of basis points rates points in thousands total fair market value 
table of contents the fair value of our long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december  and the carrying value was million 
the fair market value of our convertible senior debentures was estimated based upon quoted market prices 
derivatives we do not use any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and europe and operating expenses in japan and the netherlands 
at the present time  we do not hedge against these currency exposures  but as these exposures grow we may consider hedging against currency movements 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities  typically us treasury securities and municipal bonds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
