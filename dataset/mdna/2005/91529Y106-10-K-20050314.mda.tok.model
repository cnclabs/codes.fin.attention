table of contents significant transactions and events settlement of multistate market conduct examination during  certain of the company s insurance subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination led by maine  massachusetts  and tennessee relating to disability claims handling practices 
a total of states and the district of columbia are parties to the settlement agreements 
in addition  the us department of labor dol  which had been conducting an inquiry relating to certain erisa plans  is a party to the settlement agreements  and the office of the new york attorney general  which had engaged in its own investigation of the company s claims handling practices  notified the company that it was in support of the settlement and was  therefore  closing its investigation on this issue 
the examination report did not make any findings of violations of law or market conduct regulations 
however  the examination report did identify areas of concern 
these became the focus of specific changes and enhancements to the company s disability claims handling operations which are designed to assure each claim decision is made in a consistently high quality manner 
the primary components of the settlement agreements include enhancements to the company s claims handling procedures  a reassessment process for claimants of certain previously denied or closed claims who elect to participate  additional corporate and board governance to support the oversight of the reassessment process and general claims handling practices  and payment of a fine in the amount of million to be allocated among the states and jurisdictions that joined the agreements and a potential fine of million in the future if certain standards are not met in examinations at the end of approximately two years 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million  before tax  or million  after tax  comprised of four elements million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the two year reassessment process  million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment  million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented  and the million fine 
the charge decreased before tax operating results for group income protection  individual income protection recently issued  and individual income protection closed block million  million  and million  respectively 
the ongoing costs of changes in the claims handling process and governance improvements will be included in the company s operating expenses as incurred going forward 
these ongoing costs are not anticipated to materially affect the company s results of operations 
the insurance commissioners of maine  massachusetts  and tennessee  the states in which the company s three principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  began the multistate targeted market conduct examination in september and  as the lead state regulators  directed the course of the exam 
the company also has an insurance subsidiary domiciled in new york  but new york had been proceeding separately with its market conduct examination prior to commencement of the multistate examination 
it became a participating state and also entered into a substantially identical settlement agreement covering the subsidiary domiciled in new york 
the purpose of the examination was to determine whether the long term disability claims handling practices of the company s insurance subsidiaries reflected unfair claim settlement practices 
examiners working under the direction of the three lead state regulators reviewed policy forms  manuals  and administration and organization charts  but primarily focused on reviewing individual or group long term claim files closed  appealed  or open during two time periods from to early the claim file review led to discussions with the company that resulted in the settlement agreements 
a principal feature of the settlement agreements is a reassessment process 
under the agreements  the company is offering to reassess any individual or group long term disability claim that was denied or closed since january   except for specific categories of closures such as settlement  death  or payment of maximum benefits 
the potential pool of claims decided over the nearly five year period that are eligible for reassessment if the claimant elects to participate is approximately  claims 
however  almost half of these claims are subject to a preliminary determination as to whether the claimant seeking reassessment returned to work under the policy  in which case the claim is not eligible for further reassessment 
the company will also accept requests for 
table of contents reassessment from other individuals whose claims were closed after january   and through december   subject to the same closure exceptions as the group receiving notice  and from claimants who dispute the category for closure if it affects their eligibility for reassessment 
there will be ongoing oversight by the company and lead state regulators of the reassessment process 
the dol may also participate in this monitoring of the reassessment process 
the company has also agreed to enhance certain aspects of its claim operations  including making changes to its organization and procedures to improve the consistency of and the support for each claim decision and create an easier process for claimants 
first  the company is increasing the number of experienced claims professionals involved in making claim decisions  as well as more heavily involving higher levels of management in signing off on adverse claim decisions 
doing so will not only put more experienced people into closer contact with claim decisions  but it should also improve turnaround times and clarify accountability for claims decisions 
second  to improve the support for the initial claim decisions  the company is modifying its policies regarding medical information  including guidelines for the use of independent medical evaluations and the process for handling claimants with multiple medical conditions 
third  to make it easier for a claimant to understand and proceed through the claim process  the company is adding a number of service components  including referring certain claims to field personnel who will meet with the claimant in an effort to make the process less burdensome 
also  there will be an additional telephone hotline available to claimants who seek additional assistance 
finally  to further assure consistency in the initial claim decision  the company is adding a position of quality compliance consultant to assess the totality of the claim decision and to focus on issues of compliance and documentation 
the final principal part of the settlement agreements addresses aspects of corporate governance which are intended to reflect today s greater emphasis in this area and to help establish best practices for the industry 
a regulatory compliance unit  reporting directly to a newly formed regulatory compliance committee of the board of directors  was created to monitor the reassessment process  compliance with market conduct regulations and erisa requirements  as well as general claims handling compliance 
the committee will be composed of five independent directors  including two directors with significant insurance industry or insurance regulatory experience 
the agreements will remain in place until the later of january   or the completion of an examination of claims handling practices and an examination of the reassessment process  both of which will be conducted by the lead state regulators 
in addition to the fine of million  the insurance subsidiaries that are parties to the settlement agreements are subject as a group to potential fines for non compliance with the settlement agreements  including contingent fines of  per day if certain implementation deadlines are not met and a contingent fine of million for failure to satisfactorily meet the performance standards in the settlement agreements relating to the examinations referred to above  which will be conducted in approximately two years 
this latter contingent fine relating to examination of the claims handling practices or the reassessment process is limited to a maximum of million for both examinations should the performance standards not be met 
the performance standard is based on compliance with a maximum tolerance standard for claims procedures based on review of a statistically credible random sample of individual or group claims 
the company believes that the changes it has made and will be making to its claims operations and to enhance its oversight functions will substantially reduce the likelihood that the company would fail to meet the performance standards in the agreements when these examinations are concluded 
arizona  california  minnesota  and new mexico participated in the multistate examination  however  while the multistate examination was in progress those states chose to continue pursuing their own market conduct examinations and investigations  each of which had begun prior to the beginning of the multistate examination 
the company reached agreement with the minnesota department of commerce covering three exam periods dating from and involving three of the company s insurance subsidiaries  which have agreed to pay a penalty totaling  relating to various matters outside the general scope of the multistate examination 
minnesota joined the multistate settlement agreements 
california has conducted an examination with two phases and an investigation relating to claims handling 
california chose not to join the multistate settlement agreements  and discussions with the california department of insurance have been ongoing relating to various issues  some of which are within the general scope of the multistate examination and others that are outside its scope and relate to california specific issues 
arizona and new mexico consented to join the multistate settlement agreements 
the company understands that arizona is in the process of concluding its examination that will focus on non claim related matters  and new mexico may  or may not  continue to pursue its own examination which was begun prior to the multistate examination 

table of contents restructuring of individual income protection closed block business in the first quarter of  the company restructured its individual income protection closed block business wherein three of its insurance subsidiaries entered into reinsurance agreements to reinsure approximately percent of potential future losses that occur above a specified retention limit 
the individual income protection closed block reserves in these three subsidiaries comprise approximately percent of the company s overall retained risk in the closed block of individual income protection 
the reinsurance agreements effectively provide approximately percent reinsurance coverage for the company s overall consolidated risk above the retention limit  which equals approximately billion in existing statutory reserves 
the maximum risk limit for the reinsurer is approximately million initially and grows to approximately billion over time  after which any further losses will revert to the company 
these reinsurance transactions were effective as of april  the company transferred cash equal to million of reserves ceded in the individual income protection closed block segment plus an additional million in cash for a before tax prepaid cost of insurance which was deferred and will be amortized into earnings over the expected claim payment period covered under the company s retention limit 
the company retained the higher yielding investments historically associated with these reserves and redeployed these investments to other lines of business 
in conjunction with the restructuring of the individual income protection closed block business  effective january   the company modified its reporting segments to include a separate segment for this business 
the reporting  monitoring  and management of the closed block of individual income protection business as a discrete segment is consistent with the company s financial restructuring and separation of this business from the lines of business which actively market new products 
in the past  this business had been reported in the income protection segment 
prior to  detailed separate financial metrics and models were unavailable to appropriately manage this block of business separately from the recently issued individual income protection block of business 
the change in the company s reporting segments required the company to perform  separately for the individual income protection closed block business and individual income protection recently issued business  impairment testing for goodwill and loss recognition testing for the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
as required under gaap  prior to the change in reporting segments  these tests were performed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis

the segmentation of the investment portfolio was necessary to ensure appropriate matching of the duration of the assets and the related policy liabilities 
based on this analysis  in the first quarter of the company increased its individual income protection closed block claim reserves by million before tax  or million after tax  to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations 
the first quarter change represented a percent increase in total net individual income protection closed block reserves as of march   which for continuing operations equaled billion prior to this increase

after settlement of the common stock purchase contract in  the weighted average common shares outstanding for computing net income per common share  both basic and assuming dilution  will increase by the actual number of shares issued 
proceeds from the offering were used to restore the company s insurance subsidiaries risk based capital to the approximate overall level that existed prior to the individual income protection closed block reinsurance transaction and to provide additional liquidity at the holding company level

the deficit reduction act of required that no future amounts be added after to the policyholders surplus account and that any future distributions to shareholders from the account would become subject to federal income tax at the general corporate federal income tax rate then in effect 
during  the american jobs creation act of ajca was enacted 
the ajca provides  in part  that distributions from policyholders surplus accounts during and will not be taxed 
the amount of the policyholders surplus accounts of the company s life insurance subsidiaries at december   was approximately million 
under the ajca  distributions made during and by these life insurance subsidiaries  including dividend distributions  are deemed to occur first from the policyholders surplus accounts 
as a result  the company s life insurance subsidiaries expect to distribute the entire balance of their policyholders surplus accounts to the holding company during and this will result in the elimination of a future potential tax of approximately million 
this will also allow the company to engage in transactions in the future without concern of triggering a tax liability related to distributions from the policyholders surplus accounts 
no current or deferred federal income taxes have currently been provided on the amounts in the policyholders surplus accounts because management considers the conditions under which such taxes would be paid to be remote 
therefore  this provision of the ajca does not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
the ajca also provides for a deduction of percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated during  up to million 
the company is currently reviewing its ability to take advantage of this provision and has not yet completed its evaluation

included in operating results is income of million before tax and approximately million after tax attributable to these prior year tax items 
disregarding any potential unusual adjustments with regard to legislative changes or irs exams  the company expects the effective tax rate in to approximate percent 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the increased earnings in the company s uk operations

significant transactions and events reserve strengthening in april  the company completed an analysis of its assumptions related to its group long term income protection claim reserves 
included in the analysis was a review of active claim reserves  incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  and claim reopen reserves 
an active claim reserve is established for future benefit payments when a claim is incurred and reported to the company 
ibnr reserves are established on claims which are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
claim reopen reserves are established for those claimants who have previously recovered but who are anticipated to return to disabled status under the same disability and within a specified period of time  as contractually allowed by the disability policy 
the analysis was initiated based on lower claim resolution rates observed during the first quarter of the claim resolution rate is the rate of probability that a disability claimant will recover  die  or reach maximum benefit limits and no longer receive benefit payments from the company 
generally  claim resolution rates vary by the age of the claimant at the time of disability  duration or length of time since the disability initially occurred  and claim diagnosis 
the claim resolution rates for group long term income protection during the first quarter of were below levels anticipated for reserves and were lower than those experienced in the full years   and the analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim resolution rates  but also a change in claim resolution rates by claim duration 
the analysis of emerging claim resolution rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the company s long term expectations with respect to claim resolution rates 
the company s long term expectations applied to all claims incurred regardless of the date of incurral 
in addition  the company reviewed the reserve discount rate  which is the interest rate at which future cash flows for benefits and expenses to be paid are discounted to determine the current value of those cash flows 
the company concluded at that time that a change in its discount rate assumptions was not warranted 
based on the april analysis  in the first quarter of the company increased its group long term income protection claim reserves by million before tax  or million after tax  to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations 
the active claim reserve for claims already reported to the company and still in open claim status was increased by million  the ibnr reserve was decreased by million  and the reopen reserve was decreased by million before tax

based upon this review  as of december   the company increased its group long term income protection claim reserves by million and its group short term income protection claim reserves by million  for a total increase of million before tax and million after tax 
approximately million of the reserve strengthening reflected implementation of a lower discount rate for the company s group income protection claim reserves 
the discount rate was lowered to reflect the company s actual change in investment portfolio yield rates during  the expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates  and the company s new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate 
the company s new discount rate management approach is intended to better reflect the current investment environment and position the company to be more responsive with discount rates on new incurred claims as changes to the investment environment emerge 
approximately million of the reserve increase related to a strengthening of the morbidity assumptions to reflect the impact of the company s view of a continuing jobless economic recovery 
table of contents on claim incidence and severity 
of this amount  approximately million was established to reflect higher claim incidence expectations 
claim incidence in the second half of was percent higher than the first half of the year and percent above the second half of the company s january review indicated that claim incidence is expected to continue at an elevated level for several quarters as the company believes that early indications of a recovering economy are not yet reflected in improved consumer confidence or job creation 
also included in the million strengthening was approximately million to reflect higher severity expectations driven primarily by a lengthening of claim duration expectations in those claims that have been open months or longer 
the million reserve increase represented a percent increase in total net group income protection reserves as of december   which totaled billion prior to this increase 
acquisitions and dispositions during the first quarter of  unum limited acquired the united kingdom group income protection business of sun life assurance company of canada uk ltd sun life together with the renewal rights to sun life s group life business  at a price of approximately million

critical accounting policies reserves for policy and contract benefits the two primary categories of liabilities for policy and contract benefits are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred and have future benefits to be paid 
policy reserves equal the present value of the difference between future policy benefits and expenses and future premiums  allowing a margin for profit 
these reserves are applicable for the majority of the company s business  which is traditional non interest sensitive in nature 
the claim payments are estimated using assumptions established when the policy was issued 
throughout the life of the policy  the reserve is based on the original assumptions used for the policy s issue year 
ordinarily  generally accepted accounting principles require that these assumptions not be subsequently modified unless the policy reserves are determined to be inadequate 
a claim reserve is established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
policy reserves for a particular policy continue to be maintained after a claim reserve has been established for as long as the policy remains in force 
claim reserves generally equal the company s estimate  at the current reporting period  of the present value of the liability for future benefits and expenses to be paid on claims incurred as of that date 
a claim reserve for a specific claim is based on assumptions derived from the company s actual historical experience as to claim duration as well as the specific characteristics of the claimant such as benefits available under the policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant 
consideration is given to current and historical trends in the company s experience and to expected deviations from historical experience that result from changes in benefits available  changes in the company s risk management policies and procedures  and other economic  environmental  or societal factors 
reserves for claims that are estimated to have already been incurred but that have not yet been reported to the company are based on factors such as historical claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 
claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
in a reporting period  actual experience may deviate from the long term assumptions used to determine the claim reserves 
the company reviews annually  or more frequently as appropriate  emerging experience to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses 
the company s reserves for group and individual income protection products include a provision for future payments  other than legal expenses  on all claim related lawsuits for which the cause of action has already occurred 
this includes known lawsuits and those yet to be filed 
the reserve amount is the company s estimate of the payments on all such lawsuits based on past payments and expected future payments 
claim reserves  net of ceded reinsurance  were billion at december  claim reserves  in general  are an estimate of the current value of future  otherwise unfunded  benefit commitments or liabilities 
the calculation of claim reserves involves numerous assumptions 
in setting these assumptions  the company depends upon industry information and experience  company experience and analysis  and reasoned judgment 
there can be no guarantee that these assumptions individually  or collectively  will be duplicated by actual experience over time 
the primary assumptions related to claim reserves are the discount rate  the claim resolution rate  and the incidence rate for ibnr claims 
the discount rate is the interest rate at which future benefit cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of those cash flows 
it is important since higher discount rates produce lower reserves 
if the discount rate is higher than future investment returns  the company s reserves will not earn sufficient investment income to support future liabilities 
in this case  the reserves will eventually be insufficient 
alternatively  if a discount rate is chosen that is too low relative to future investment results  the reserve  and thus the claim cost in the current period  will be overstated and profits will be accumulated in the reserves rather than released to current shareholders through earnings 
the company sets its discount rate assumptions in conjunction with the current and expected future investment income rate of the assets supporting the reserves 
if the investment yield at which new investments are 
table of contents purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate on new claims will be established below or above the discount rate on existing claims 
it is the company s intent to use a discount rate that provides some margin for adverse movement in the investment portfolio yield rate 
since policies may receive claim payments for a number of years  it is unlikely that the chosen discount rate assumption will prove to be accurate for any one policy  rather  the discount rate is chosen to apply to many claims with various characteristics of length and severity 
the company uses its experience and analysis of its existing claims and investment performance to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption 
actual claim reserves incurred in the calendar quarter are sensitive to the choice of discount rate 
for example  a basis point increase or decrease in the group long term income protection claim discount rate would have changed a quarter s incurred claim cost in by approximately million 
the claim resolution rate is the rate of probability that a disability claim will close or change due to maximum benefits being paid under the policy  the recovery or death of the insured  or a change in status in any given period 
it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim 
estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time 
a claim closes due to maximum benefits being paid if all of the contractual benefits under the policy have been paid 
a claim also closes if the policyholder recovers from his or her disability and is no longer receiving disability benefit payments or if the policyholder dies in the period 
a claim may change status during the period 
for example  a policyholder receiving disability benefits may return to part time work  and the claim benefit may be reduced to reflect the change to partial disability 
establishing claim resolution assumptions is complex and involves many factors  including the cause of disability  the policyholder s age  the type of contractual benefits provided  etc 
claim resolution assumptions also vary by duration of disability and time since initially becoming disabled 
the company uses its extensive claim experience and analysis to develop its claim resolution assumptions 
claim resolution experience is studied over a number of years with more weight placed on the more recent experience 
claim resolution assumptions are established to represent the company s future resolution rate expectations 
due to the individual nature of each claim  it is unlikely that the claim resolution rate will be accurate for any particular claim 
the company establishes its claim resolution assumptions to apply as an average to its large base of active claims 
in this manner  the assumed rates are much more accurate over the broad base of claims 
actual claim reserves incurred in the calendar quarter are sensitive to the choice of resolution rate 
for example  a one percent increase or decrease in the group long term income protection claim resolution rate would have changed a quarter s incurred claim cost in by approximately million 
the company has liability for claims that have been incurred but not reported to the company and must establish a liability for these claims equal to the present value of the expected benefit payments 
in addition to the discount rate and claim resolution rate  the incidence rate is also a primary assumption in the ibnr reserve 
the incidence rate is the rate at which new claims per thousand insured lives are submitted to the company 
the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured  the insured s occupation or industry  the benefit plan design  and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment 
the company establishes the incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations 
as the actual claims are reported and claim reserves are established  the accuracy of the ibnr emerges 
while the company expects its ibnr reserve to be appropriate over the long term  it will not always equal  in a particular reporting period  the actual reserve established for a reported claim 
for example  a basis point deviation in the actual incidence rate from that assumed in the ibnr reserve would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million in claim reserves established during a quarter in  relative to the ibnr reserve previously established to cover those claims 

table of contents presented as follows are reserves by each major line of business within each segment with discussion regarding material changes 
in millions of dollars december  december  ibnr all other total ibnr all other total group income protection individual income protection recently issued long term care income protection segment life and accident segment colonial segment individual income protection closed block segment other segment consolidated from continuing operations ibnr for income protection includes reopen reserves 
these two categories of reserves are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis 
equals the sum of policy and contract benefits  reserves for future policy and contract benefits and unearned premiums  and other policyholders funds as reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the increase in ibnr within the income protection and life and accident segments is directly related to the underlying growth in the business 
the rapid premium growth within the company s operations in the united kingdom contributed to this ibnr growth along with premium growth within the long term care and individual income protection recently issued lines of business 
additionally  ibnr reserves for group income protection  individual income protection recently issued  and individual income protection closed block increased million  million  and million  respectively  in the fourth quarter of for the reserve charge related to settlement of the multistate market conduct examination 
the increase in all other reserves is driven by growth within the uk operations and the long term care line of business along with the first quarter of reserve charge of million in the individual income protection closed block segment 
additionally  all other reserves for group income protection increased million in the fourth quarter of for the reserve charge related to settlement of the multistate market conduct examination 
a portion of the reported growth in the reserves for the uk operations also resulted from the favorable foreign currency exchange rate in relative to  which increased ibnr reserves approximately million and all other reserves approximately million 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company defers certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortizes expenses these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include certain commissions  other agency compensation  selection and policy issue expenses  and field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 
the company uses its own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of its business in determining the expected life of the policies 
approximately percent of the company s deferred policy acquisition costs relate to traditional non interest sensitive products  for which the costs are amortized in proportion to the estimated premium income to be received over the life of the policies in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial 
table of contents accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
amortization of deferred costs on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience 
the company will experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
deferred costs related to group and individual income protection products are generally amortized over a twenty year period  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs related to group income protection products expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
for individual income protection policies  approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
deferred costs for group and individual long term care products are amortized over a twenty year period  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
deferred costs for group life and accidental and death and dismemberment products are amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the cost expected to be amortized by year ten 
deferred costs for brokerage voluntary life and other products are amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the cost expected to be amortized by year ten 
deferred costs for products issued by the colonial segment are amortized over a seventeen year period  on average  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
due to the company s actual persistency experienced in recent years relative to what was expected when policies were issued  the company lowered its premium persistency assumptions for costs deferred in and thereafter for certain of its products to reflect the company s current estimate of persistency 
this accelerates the amortization of group income protection and group life acquisition costs deferred in those years into the early life of the policy 
valuation of fixed maturity securities in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company evaluates the following factors the probability of recovering principal and interest 
the company s ability and intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover 
whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments 
the significance of the decline in value 
the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value 
current and future business prospects and trends of earnings 
the valuation of the security s underlying collateral 
relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles 
market conditions 
rating agency actions 
bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity 
adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments 
any other key measures for the related security 
the company s review procedures include  but are not limited to  monthly meetings of certain members of the company s senior management personnel to review reports on the entire portfolio  identifying investments with changes in market value of five percent or more  investments with changes in rating either by external rating agencies or internal analysts  investments segmented by issuer  industry  and foreign exposure levels  and any other relevant investment information to help identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses 
based on this review of the entire investment portfolio  individual investments may be added to or removed from the company s watch list  which is a list of securities subject to enhanced monitoring and a more intensive review 
the company also determines if its investment portfolio is overexposed to an issuer that is showing warning signs of deterioration and  if so  the company makes no further purchases of that issuer s securities and may seek opportunities 
table of contents to sell securities it holds from that issuer to reduce the company s exposure 
the company monitors below investment grade securities as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio as an additional credit risk management strategy  looking specifically at the company s exposure to individual securities currently classified as below investment grade 
in determining current and future business prospects and cash availability  the company considers the parental support of an issuer in its analysis but does not rely heavily on this support 
if the company determines that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period to the extent of the decline in value 
if the decline is considered temporary  the security continues to be carefully monitored 
these controls have been established to identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses and are intended to give the company the ability to respond rapidly 
the company has no held to maturity fixed maturity securities 
all fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
fair values are based on quoted market prices  where available 
private placement fixed maturity securities had a fair value of approximately billion  or percent of total fixed maturity securities at december  private placement fixed maturity securities do not have readily determinable market prices 
for these securities  the company uses internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  the company obtains prices from independent third party brokers to establish valuations for certain of these securities 
the company s ability to liquidate its positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and the company may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although the company believes its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market 
the company believes that generally these private placement securities carry a credit quality comparable to companies rated baa or bbb by major credit rating organizations 
as of december   the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to reflect the lack of liquidity 
an additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments 
additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
increasing the basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by basis points  increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point  and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the december  net unrealized gain in the fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately million 
historically  the company s realized gains or losses on dispositions of its private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above 
changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities  other than declines that are determined to be other than temporary  are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
if it is subsequently determined that any of these securities are other than temporarily impaired  the impairment loss is reported as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the recognition of the impairment loss does not affect total stockholders equity to the extent that the decline in value had been previously reflected in other comprehensive income 

table of contents there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring the company s fixed maturity securities for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the security may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
reinsurance receivable reinsurance is a contractual agreement whereby the company s reinsurance partners assume a defined portion of the risk for future benefits payable under reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance receivable reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition includes amounts due from the company s reinsurers on current claims and estimates of amounts that will be due on future claims 
policy reserves and claim reserves reported in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition are not reduced for reinsurance 
the reinsurance receivable is generally equal to the policy reserves and claim reserves related to the risk being reinsured 
the company reduces the reinsurance receivable if recovery is not likely due to the financial position of the reinsurer or if there is disagreement between the company and the reinsurer regarding the liability of the reinsurer 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized  but the company reviews on an annual basis the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment  with consideration given to financial performance and other relevant factors 
in accordance with accounting guidance  the company tests for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below 
in addition  certain events including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment  an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency  or unanticipated competition would cause the company to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually 
the goodwill reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition at december  is attributable primarily to the acquisition of paul revere life insurance company individual income protection recently issued business and genex services  inc disability management services business 
the impairment testing for goodwill involves estimating the fair value of the individual income protection block of recently issued business and the fair value of the disability management services business based upon the present value of future cash flows using assumptions such as future sales  morbidity experience  portfolio yield rate  and the rate of return at which the company believes the market would price the businesses for purchase 
adverse changes in any of these factors could result in an impairment of goodwill for either or both of the blocks of business 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company s valuation allowance relates primarily to assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and assets for the company s basis in certain of its foreign subsidiaries that are not likely to be realized in the future based on management s expectations using currently available evidence 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  the company has considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event the company determines that it most likely would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

table of contents the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability 
the company records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes will probably be due 
however  due to the complexity of the tax laws and uncertainties in their interpretation  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the probable tax liabilities 
if the estimate of the tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer probable 
management believes that adequate accruals have been provided for all years presented 
cash outlays for income taxes are not expected to exceed income tax expense during the next three years

sales  together with persistency of the existing block of business and the company s renewal program  are an indicator of growth in the company s premium and fee income 
trends in new sales  as well as existing market share  are also indicators of the company s potential for growth in its respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new product offerings

the company intends to maintain its disciplined approach to pricing  renewals  and risk selection  with a focused effort on balancing growth and profitability 
while managing its business mix in this disciplined manner  the company expects to continue to be a leading provider in the large employer market segment 
the company has field sales personnel who specialize in employer provided plans for employees and supplemental benefit plans that include multi life income protection and long term care product offerings and products sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace 
these field sales personnel partner with company representatives from claims  customer service  and underwriting who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants to present coverage solutions to potential customers and to manage existing customer accounts 
the company utilizes a distribution model for the sale of individual income protection and individual long term care insurance products whereby independent brokers and consultants are provided direct access to a sales support center centrally located in the company s corporate offices

the decrease in the us sales was partially offset by growth of percent in the company s united kingdom operations 
the comparative decline for versus in short term income protection aso sales was primarily due to a large case sold in sales for individual income protection decreased in relative to the prior year  with declines in the company s united kingdom operations and in the company s us operations 
the sales decline occurred primarily in the us individual sales market rather than in the multi life market 
the portion of the individual income protection sales attributable to multi life business in the company s us operations was approximately percent of sales and percent of sales 
segment persistency and renewal of existing business the company monitors persistency of its existing business and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current period s amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
one way in which the company monitors persistency is at the overall block of business level ie  group long term income protection  group short term income protection  and group life 
persistency  at the overall block of business level  is the year to date rate at which existing business for all issue years in the block of business at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period 
in determining whether additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is required due to adverse persistency  the company measures persistency by issue year ie  the rate at which existing business for that specific issue year at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period 
the rate of persistency for an overall block of business may improve while individual issue years within the overall block of business may deteriorate and require additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
persistency during for the overall block of group long term income protection on average declined from that experienced in terminations were more heavily concentrated in the large employer market  while persistency in the small and mid employer market improved slightly in compared to persistency for fully insured short term income protection also declined during  on average  over the prior year 
these declines in persistency were expected due to the company s more disciplined approach to pricing  renewals  and risk selection 
approximately percent of the company s group business has an effective renewal date of january the company experienced a decline in persistency for group income protection business to be renewed effective january  the company believes this is attributable to the competitive pricing environment and the company s continued pricing discipline and  to a lesser extent  the adverse publicity surrounding the company 
the company expects that persistency for its overall 
table of contents block of us group long term income protection business will be approximately to percent in persistency for group short term income protection is not expected to be materially different from the level of for the years and subsequent  the company lowered its premium persistency assumptions for group income protection policy acquisition costs deferred in those years to reflect its current estimate of persistency 
this accelerated the amortization of group long term and short term income protection acquisition costs deferred in those years into the early life of the policy by using lower premium persistency assumptions to determine the scheduled or expected amortization 
although persistency in the future may be lower than historical levels  particularly in certain issue years due to the company s increased emphasis on retaining profitable business  the acceleration of scheduled amortization may eliminate the need for additional amortization related to the decline in actual persistency relative to scheduled or expected persistency 
the persistency of individual income protection and long term care continues to be within expected levels 
during the third quarter of  the company completed comprehensive scenario testing with respect to the amortization and recoverability of its group income protection and group life deferred policy acquisition costs under severe prolonged adverse persistency levels 
the deferred policy acquisition costs were fully recoverable  even when tested at persistency rates deteriorating to below percent and continuing at that level throughout the remainder of the life of the inforce block 
the assessment was performed primarily to test the limits of recoverability 
sustained adverse persistency at the levels tested  while not resulting in a loss recognition charge  would result in lower emerging future profits due to lower overall premium levels and additional acceleration  on a prospective basis  of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs relative to the scheduled or expected amortization  but the company does not anticipate prolonged persistency rates at the stress levels tested 
the study was the result of normal experience testing 
persistency during for the overall block of group long term income protection on average was higher than that experienced in persistency for fully insured short term income protection also improved  on average  over the prior year 
during  persistency for group long term and short term income protection was lower for certain issue years when compared to the persistency expected at the time the business was written 
this resulted in additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of million in for group income protection 
there was no additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in as previously discussed  since the company s actual persistency experienced in recent years was lower than that expected when policies were issued  the company lowered its premium persistency assumptions for costs deferred in and subsequent to reflect its current estimate of persistency 
a critical part of the company s strategy for group income protection involves executing its renewal program and managing persistency in its existing block of business 
although the renewal program is smaller than that of  the company believes this strategy will have a positive effect on future profitability 
the company has shifted emphasis from revenue growth to profit margin expansion  raising prices and remaining more disciplined in risk selection  and restoring a more balanced mix of business between small  medium  and large employer customers  since large employer customers are often more price sensitive and vulnerable to weak economic conditions 
the company s previous renewal programs have generally been successful in retaining group income protection business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated 
while it is expected that the additional premium and related profits associated with renewal activity will continue to emerge  the company intends to balance the renewal program with the need to maximize persistency and retain producer relationships

excluding those reserve charges as well as the reserve strengthening previously discussed  the benefit ratio for declined compared to contributing to the decline in the benefit ratio relative to was a decrease in the submitted claim incidence rate for group long term income protection 
this reduced benefits and change in reserves approximately million relative to the prior year 
the company believes the incidence levels are driven in part by economic trends  including consumer confidence 
also contributing to the decrease in the benefit ratio in relative to was an increase in premium per insured life primarily due to rate increases placed on poorer performing business through the renewal program 
partially offsetting the factors contributing to the decline in the benefit ratio was a lower claim discount rate used for new claims occurring in relative to the rate used in  which resulted in the establishment of higher claim reserves in of approximately million had the lower discount rate not been used 
for group short term income protection  the benefit ratio was lower primarily due to a decline in paid claim incidence in compared to the prior year

as discussed under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the company s group income protection business 
components of claims experience  including  but not limited to  incidence levels and claims duration  may be worse than expected 
the company  similar to all financial institutions  has some exposure in a severe and prolonged economic recession  but many of the company s products can be re priced  which would allow the company to reflect in its pricing any fundamental change which might occur in the risk associated with a particular industry or company within an industry 
although approximately percent of the company s overall block of group income protection business is in the manufacturing and wholesale retail industry segments  which tend to be economically sensitive  the company believes it has a well diversified book of insurance exposure  with no disproportionate concentrations of risk in any one industry 

table of contents the company expects to price new business and re price existing business  at contract renewal dates  in an attempt to mitigate the effect of incidence levels  claims duration  and other factors  including interest rates  on new claim liabilities 
given the competitive market conditions for the company s income protection products  it is uncertain whether pricing actions can entirely mitigate the effect

the company will continue to concentrate on sales growth and increased profitability for its voluntary brokerage and other lines 
since the group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are primarily sold in conjunction with group income protection  the more focused renewal effort in group income protection may reduce persistency somewhat in the group life line as well

total revenue is expected to decline very slowly over time as the company believes that persistency will remain in the mid percent range 
the company believes that the interest adjusted loss ratio will be relatively flat over the long term  but the segment may experience quarterly volatility 
the expense ratio is expected to remain fairly consistent throughout with that reported for as discussed previously  future operating earnings relative to and prior will be positively impacted due to the lack of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired

investments overview investment activities are an integral part of the company s business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results

the company seeks to maximize investment income and total return and to assume credit risk in a prudent and selective manner  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations 
the company s overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of its insurance products 
assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities  and the portfolio is matched with liabilities so as to eliminate as much as possible the company s exposure to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
the company is able to hold to this investment philosophy throughout credit and interest rate cycles because of its capital position  the fixed nature of its liabilities  and the matching of those liabilities with assets and also because of the experience gained through many years of a consistent investment philosophy

a maximum of percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities  two percent in equity type instruments  up to percent in private placements  and five percent in commercial mortgage loans 
the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities  and us government agencies and municipal securities 
the company does not currently intend to invest in additional real estate

these internal limits are as follows rating internal limit in millions aaa a bbb bbb bb bbb bb b bb b the portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines 
derivative instruments may be used to hedge interest rate risk and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan approved by the board of directors 
asset mix guidelines and limits are established by the company and approved by the board of directors 
the allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification by the investment subcommittee of the board of directors on a weekly basis 
these actions are also reviewed and approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis

these changes are generally temporary and are not recognized as realized investment losses unless the securities are sold  a decision is made that it is unlikely that the company will hold the securities until recovery  or the securities become other than temporarily impaired 
generally  below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns 
as previously discussed under critical accounting policies contained herein  in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company utilizes a formal  well defined  and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate its fixed income investment portfolio 
it includes certain members of senior management in addition to the company s other investment and accounting professionals 
the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of realized losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other than temporary impairment 
for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss and on which the company has not recorded an impairment loss  the company believes that the decline in fair value below amortized cost is temporary 
the company has the ability to hold its securities to the earlier of recovery or maturity and intends to hold all of its fixed maturity investments until maturity to meet its liability obligations 
if information becomes available that changes the company s assessment as to whether the company will receive contractual payments related to a fixed maturity security and the security is also not projected to recover in value  the related security is generally sold 
the company may also in certain circumstances sell a security in an unrealized loss position because of changes in tax laws  when a merger or the disposition of a segment or product line results in positions outside of the company s investment guidelines  due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements  due to unexpected changes in liquidity needs  or to take advantage of tender offers that recover up to or beyond the cost of the investment 
for those securities with a gross unrealized loss of million or greater  further discussed as follows are a the factors which the company believes resulted in the impairment and b the information the company considered  both positive and negative  in reaching the conclusion that the impairments were not other than temporary 
the fixed maturity bond of the us government sponsored mortgage funding company was issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
the bond was rated aaa by standard poor s corporation s p as of december   with no negative outlook by rating agencies or in analysts reports 
the changes in the market value of this security relates to changes in interest rates subsequent to the purchase of the bond 
the company believes that the decline in fair value of this security is temporary 
the company has the ability to hold this security to the earlier of recovery or maturity and intends to hold its fixed maturity investments until maturity to meet its liability obligations 

table of contents the principal protected equity linked note is a zero coupon bond  issued by a large  well capitalized fortune financial services company  the return of which is linked to a vanguard s p index mutual fund 
this bond matures on august  and carries the aaa rating of the issuer  as determined by s p as of december  this note has an embedded derivative contract and substitutes highly rated bonds in place of the underlying s p index mutual fund to provide principal protection in the event of a significant decline in the equities market 
the note derives its value from the underlying s p index mutual fund 
the reduction in the market value of this note was the result of the decline in the s p index subsequent to the purchase date of the note 
the s p index had an percent return for the twelve months ending december  based on historical long term returns of the s p index  the company believes that the value of the underlying s p index mutual fund will equate to or exceed the par value of the security at maturity 
the company therefore believes that the decline in fair value of the note is temporary 
the company has the ability to hold this security to the earlier of recovery or maturity and intends to hold its fixed maturity investments until maturity to meet its liability obligations 
the company s investment in mortgage backed and asset backed securities was approximately billion and billion on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
at december   the mortgage backed securities had an average life of years and effective duration of years 
the mortgage backed and asset backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment 
the company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities at december   was  million  representing percent of the fair value of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans 
below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
the company expects that additional downgrades may occur during  but the company does not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by its investments in below investment grade securities  nor does it expect these investments to adversely affect its ability to hold its other investments to maturity 
the company has a significant interest in  but is not the primary beneficiary of  a special purpose entity which is a collateralized bond obligation asset trust in which the company holds interests in several of the tranches and for which the company acts as investment manager of the underlying securities

this will allow the company to leverage its operational structure currently in place for its existing mortgage loan portfolio and to utilize an additional investment category in its portfolio strategies 
real estate was million and million at december  and  respectively 
investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets the company s investment criteria 
if investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value 
occasionally  investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets the company s investment criteria 
real estate held for sale  which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell  amounted to million at december  and million at december  the company uses a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each mortgage loan and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
the company establishes an investment valuation allowance for mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
investment valuation allowances for real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets 
if a decline in value of a mortgage loan or real estate investment is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired  the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value  and the reduction is recognized as a realized investment loss 
management monitors the risk associated with these invested asset portfolios and regularly reviews and adjusts the investment valuation allowance 
at december   the balance in the valuation allowances for real estate was million 
no valuation allowance was held for mortgage loans at december  derivatives the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage duration  increase yield on cash flows expected from current holdings and future premium income  and manage currency risk

positions under this hedging program involved the purchase of options on forward interest rate swaps 
as of december   the company had million notional amount of options open under this program 
almost all hedging transactions are associated with the individual and group long term care and the individual and group income protection product portfolios 
all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes

premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
debt and or other securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  and taxes  as well as purchases of new investments 
the company has established an investment strategy that management believes will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
the company s policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments  and the company therefore has minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities 
the company s cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for the company s insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims 
cash flow could also be negatively impacted by a deterioration in the credit market whereby the company s ability to liquidate its positions in certain of its fixed maturity securities would be impacted such that the company might not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
the company believes its cash resources are sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for the next twelve months

the company utilizes extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the inforce business 
the primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity  claim resolution rates  persistency rates  and interest rates 
these cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments 
the timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly from the projections above 

table of contents the company actively manages its asset and liability cash flow match as well as its asset and liability duration match in order to minimize interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the amount and timing of cash flows 
asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy 
cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios 
these results enable the company to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates 
the company may redistribute its investments within its different lines of business  when necessary  to adjust the cash flow and or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables the company to choose the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to minimize the risk of disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is a precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments  which are used to hedge interest rate risk and to match duration

other information pension and postretirement benefit plans the company maintains separate us and foreign pension plans and a us post retirement benefit plan 
the us pension plans comprise the majority of the total benefit obligation and pension expense for the company 
the value of the benefit obligations is determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent the company s best estimate of future expected experience 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
two of the economic assumptions  the discount rate and the long term rate of return  are adjusted accordingly based on key external indices 
the company follows statements of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits in its financial reporting and accounting for its pension and post retirement benefit plans 
us pension and post retirement benefit plans the assumptions chosen for us pension plans and the us postretirement plan use consistent methodology but reflect the differences in the plan obligations 
the company uses a december measurement date for each plan 
the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value 
the discount rate was determined based on a review of long term fixed income securities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
in setting the assumption  the company also has considered the change in the level of interest rates on these securities since the prior year end and the duration of the fixed income indices relative to the duration of the plans liabilities 
historically  the company has used the moody s aa corporate bond index as one of the primary benchmarks in selecting a discount rate 
as of december   this index was percent 
the company has estimated that the duration of the index is approximately years 
the majority of the obligations in the us pension plans  however  is related to active and deferred vested employees  and duration  therefore  is significantly longer  at approximately years 
the company therefore adjusted the moody s index upward by approximately basis points to arrive at the discount rate assumptions of percent as of december  as of december   the company elected to set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of its retirement related benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits 
the company elected a discount rate of percent for the us pension plans 
using a similar methodology applied to the postretirement plan cash flows  a discount rate of and percent was used as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents lowering the discount rate by basis points would have increased the pension expense for the us pension plans by million and would be expected to result in a million increase in the pension plan expense 
the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid 
for the us pension plans  the actual asset allocation at december  was percent equities and percent fixed income securities 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of large cap  mid cap  small cap  and convertible equity securities  as well as both investment grade and below investment grade fixed income securities 
the company uses a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption used for the us pension plan was percent as of december  and lowering the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by basis points would have increased the pension expense by approximately million 
for  lowering the assumption by basis points would increase pension expense by approximately million 
the market related value equals the fair value of assets  determined as of the measurement date 
the assets are not smoothed for purposes of sfas the expected return on assets  therefore  fully recognizes all asset gains and losses through the measurement date 
the company holds an unrecognized net loss representing cumulative liability and asset gains and losses that have not been recognized in pension expense 
as of december   there was an estimated unrecognized loss of approximately million in the us pension plans  compared to million at december  the unrecognized loss has increased due to the decline in the year end discount rate to percent at  from percent at  and due to a change in the assumed retirement age made as of december  the unrecognized net loss is amortized as a component of pension expense 
only amounts outside of a corridor equal to percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market related value of assets are amortized 
the pension expense is expected to include a loss amortization of approximately million 
this loss amortization was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the company reported us pension plan expense of million and million in and  respectively  compared to a negative pension expense of million in the fair value of plan assets in the funded us pension plan was million at december   compared to million at year end in recent years  the moderate increase in assets  coupled with the liability increase due to declining discount rates  has reduced the year end funding level in the plan such that it has a deficit of million as of december   compared to million as of december  foreign pension plans the company s uk operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for its employees 
the uk defined benefit pension plan scheme was closed to new entrants on december  the scheme assets are invested in pooled funds  with a percent global equity securities allocation 
the remainder of the assets is predominantly invested in fixed interest bonds and index linked bonds 
the investment policy aims to achieve growth over the medium to long term  subject to an acceptable level of risk and subject to ensuring that the assets under management are sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under uk legislation 
the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the scheme assets until current benefits are paid 
as of december  and  the long term return on asset assumption for the scheme was percent and percent  respectively 
the company elected to set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for the scheme to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits 
the discount rate assumptions were percent and percent as of december  and  respectively 
pension expense was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 

table of contents the fair value of plan assets in the scheme was million at december   compared to million at year end despite the increase in assets in recent years  the liabilities have increased at a faster rate due to declining discount rates 
the scheme has a deficit of million at december   compared to million at december  the company contributes to the scheme in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires the company to contribute to the scheme at the rate of at least percent of eligible salaries  sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
the company contribution rate of percent of eligible salaries is currently being reviewed 
based on the current contribution rate  the company anticipates it will make a contribution into the scheme of approximately million in the company previously maintained a separate defined benefit plan for the employees of its canadian branch 
as a result of the sale of the canadian branch  the company terminated the canadian defined benefit pension plan during and recorded a curtailment loss of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
the company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments 
the company uses interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair values of mortgage loans  which are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost  would decrease by approximately million at december  and at december  and  assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels  the fair values of the company s long term debt  including junior subordinated debt  would increase approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds  private placement securities  and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of basis points in interest rates 
the company previously used a matrix pricing system to determine the effect of interest rate changes on securities 
the prior year amount presented above reflects the impact which would have been reported had the company used the duration implied methodology as of december  the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage backed securities is estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage backed securities 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the 
table of contents actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values of long term debt  including junior subordinated debt  were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because the company actively manages its investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk the company is also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its foreign operations and certain investment securities denominated in those local currencies 
foreign operations  excluding discontinued operations  represented percent and percent of total assets at december  and  respectively  and percent and percent of total revenue for and  respectively 
assuming foreign exchange rates decreased percent from the december  and levels  stockholders equity and net loss as of and for the periods then ended would not have been materially affected
