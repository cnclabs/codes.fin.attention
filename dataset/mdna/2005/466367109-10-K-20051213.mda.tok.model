the increase in cash flows utilized in compared with is primarily due to expenditures related to the company s innovation center which opened in march  jack in the box restaurant improvements and qdoba capital expenditures  primarily related to new company operated restaurants 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be million to million 
we plan to open a moderate number of new jack in the box restaurants  and under our brand reinvention strategy  plan to upgrade approximately to of our restaurant facilities to create a unique new look for jack in the box restaurants at an average cost per restaurant of approximately  pension funding 
during  we elected to contribute million to our qualified defined benefit pension plans from available cash on hand  compared with million in and million in the additional funding contributions in each year were determined based on an annual actuarial review of the plans 
future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
additional potential sources of liquidity include the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
discussion of critical accounting policies we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
retirement benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans  including assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels  as determined by the company using specified guidelines 
in addition  our outside actuarial consultants also use certain statistical factors such as turnover  retirement and mortality rates to estimate the company s future benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from 
table of contents actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
due principally to decreases in interest rates  the pension expense in fiscal year is expected to be approximately million higher than fiscal year pension expense 
self insurance the company is self insured for a portion of its current and prior years losses related to its workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical  and dental programs 
in estimating the company s self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analyses of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
while medical and dental costs are anticipated to increase very modestly in fiscal year  related to the new health care coverage being offered to all crew members  we expect these cost increases to be offset by savings realized from reduced crew turnover 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review includes a market level analysis and evaluations of restaurant operating performance from operations and marketing management 
when indicators of impairment are present  we perform an impairment analysis on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the net carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
in fiscal  we recorded immaterial impairment charges related to certain restaurant closures 
during  we noted no other indicators of impairment of our long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we also have receivables related to short term financing provided on the sale of company operated restaurants to certain qualified franchisees 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our franchisees to make required payments 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
the company has good relationships with its franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate 
future application of accounting principles in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facilities expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we expect the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and generally requires  among other things  that all employee stock based compensation be measured using a fair value method and that the resulting compensation cost be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r also provides guidance on how to determine the grant date fair value for awards of equity instruments  as well as alternative methods of adopting its requirements 
on april   the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of required adoption of sfas r to the first fiscal year beginning after june  we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal year and expect the impact in fiscal to be approximately per diluted share 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by fin are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we expect the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fsp is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after december  and requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense 
we expect the adoption of this staff position will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
the company uses interest rate swaps agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at october   the company had two interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of million expiring march these agreements effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of including the term loan s applicable margin of 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or the libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
the majority of the credit facility borrowings are libor based 
as of october   our applicable margins for the libor based revolving loans and term loan were set at and  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at october   would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
the estimated increase is based on holding the unhedged portion of bank debt at its october  level 
changes in interest rates also impact our pension expense  as do changes in the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets 
an assumed discount rate is used in determining the present value of future cash outflows currently expected to be required to satisfy the pension benefit obligation when due 
additionally  an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is used in determining the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide the benefits to meet our projected benefit obligation 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our future annual pension expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
there were no open futures or options contracts at october  at october   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure other than our company owned life insurance policies
