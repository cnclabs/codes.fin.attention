our business general we are the largest manufacturer  distributor and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups in the world 
along with coca cola  which is recognized as the world s most valuable brand  we market four of the world s top five soft drink brands  including diet coke  fanta and sprite 
we provide a wide variety of nonalcoholic beverages  including carbonated soft drinks  juices and juice drinks  sports drinks  water products  teas  coffees and other beverages to meet consumers desires  needs and lifestyle choices 
our goal is to use our formidable assets brands  financial strength  unrivaled distribution system and the strong commitment by our management and employees worldwide to become more competitive 
in so doing  we expect to accelerate growth in a way that creates value for our shareowners and renewed enthusiasm among our employees 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows by manufacturing and selling beverage concentrates and syrups as well as some finished beverages 
we generally sell these products to bottling and canning operations  distributors  fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers 
we have three types of bottling relationships bottlers in which our company has no ownership interest  bottlers in which our company has a noncontrolling ownership interest and bottlers in which our company has a controlling ownership interest 
we authorize our bottling partners to manufacture and package products made from our concentrates and syrups into branded finished products that they then distribute and sell 
bottling partners in which our company has no ownership interest or a noncontrolling ownership interest produced and distributed approximately percent of our worldwide unit case volume 
we make significant marketing expenditures in support of our brands  including advertising costs  sponsorship fees and special promotional events 
as part of our marketing activities  we may provide retailers and distributors with promotions and point of sale displays  our bottling partners with advertising support and funds designated for the purchase of cold drink equipment  and our consumers with coupons  discounts and promotional incentives 
these marketing expenditures help to enhance awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands 
we believe that greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in unit case volume  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales 
the beverage industry we operate in the highly competitive global commercial beverage industry 
we face strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies 
we  along with other beverage companies  are affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  cost to manufacture and distribute products  consumer debt levels  economic conditions  consumer preferences  employment  inflation  political climate  local and national laws and regulations  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  fuel prices and weather patterns 
strengths of our company our brands 
coca cola is the most popular and biggest selling soft drink in history  and is recognized as the most valuable brand in the world 
our company owns or licenses nearly brands including carbonated soft drinks  juices and juice drinks  sports drinks  water products  teas  coffees and other beverages of which approximately billion servings a day are consumed worldwide 
our distribution system 
our bottlers sell our branded products in over countries on six continents to businesses and institutions including retail chains  supermarkets  restaurants  small neighborhood grocers  sports and entertainment venues and schools and colleges 
we continue to expand our marketing presence and increase our unit case volume growth in emerging economies throughout asia  africa and latin america 
our strong and stable system helps us to capture growth by distributing existing  enhanced and new  innovative products to our consumers throughout the world 
our people 
our employees  whom we call associates  are integral to our success 
our associates work closely with our bottling partners and other key constituencies to understand consumer preferences and market conditions around the world 
to meet our long term objectives  we recruit and actively cultivate a diverse workforce and establish a culture that fosters learning  innovation and value creation on a daily basis 
strategic initiatives establishing our marketing leadership 
carbonated soft drinks csds remain a fundamental and profitable part of our family of brands  and we believe we should invest in marketing our family of brands more aggressively than in the past few years 
in addition  we need to further expand our new products pipeline and continue to develop our innovation capabilities 
accordingly  we plan to increase our marketing and innovation spending by approximately million in and intend to maintain the increased spending level for the foreseeable future 
unleashing our system s potential 
driving enhanced revenue growth across the system is a key focus area 
our plans in this area are centered on tailoring strategies to match consumer occasions  offering differentiated packages  building value with customers  strengthening in market execution and supporting our family of brands with strong marketing activities 
markets where we effectively implement a brand  package  price and channel strategy as a system have seen strong results 
our initiatives in this area are focused around training  sharing learning across the system  and capitalizing on immediate consumption opportunities 
in this regard  we are refocusing on the basics of distribution and on increased service to the many outlets in the marketplace 
to further strengthen our capabilities in serving our largest customers  we have established  at a senior level  a chief customer officer 
executing with excellence globally 
we have a very solid base of operations throughout the world  though some regions have recently experienced inconsistent performance 
while we are working hard to grow the business throughout the world  we intend to focus specifically on performance improvement in two geographic areas north america and germany 
in north america  together with our bottling partners  we will focus on continually balancing volume  price and mix 
in  our plan in north america reflects a rigorous revenue growth management approach to our pricing as well as enhanced marketing and additional innovation 
we have worked very hard over the last few months with our bottling partners to ensure that our paths and goals are aligned and that together we can implement our growth plan 
we are in agreement with our bottling partners with respect to our strategic future and our mutual goals reflect a balanced volume and price growth plan for in germany  given the retail consolidation and rise of the discount chains  we are in the process of consolidating our bottling system to improve efficiencies 
although the system has gone from bottlers in to nine bottlers in  we are working toward a single bottler system in the german market in order to simplify our bottling and distribution operations 
as a result  we have informed our independent bottling partners in germany that their bottlers agreements will not be renewed when they expire 
since the independent bottlers agreements expire from through  we do not expect a quick resolution  however  we expect to move closer to our goal over the next two to three years 
our business demands excellence in execution 
our business is not overly complicated but we operate in a dynamic  fast paced environment of global markets and competitive economies 
excellent execution requires discipline  concrete objectives  routines  reporting  follow up  asking hard questions and the desire to take risks 
the beverage industry provides more than enough opportunities for growth  but it will take a relentless focus on execution to capitalize on those opportunities 
we have identified several specific areas that provide opportunities for growth 
we believe significant growth potential exists in diet and light products and we intend to make investments to accelerate that growth 
we also believe that the immediate consumption channel offers significant growth potential and we plan to expand the quality and quantity of our presence in this channel 
as consumer preferences change  we must ensure that our family of brands is selectively and profitably expanded to address these changing preferences 
in every market we must focus on the financial health of the entire coca cola system 
we must look for new opportunities with each customer and allocate resources to maximize the impact on any customer opportunities 
we believe we can capture this growth by focusing on our core brands to maximize the potential of each brand and through additional innovation 
revitalizing the organization 
the organizational realignments of and negatively impacted the trust within our company and our system  that had been engendered over our year history 
our goal is to revive that trust 
we also realize that our bench strength has been weakened as a result of these two organizational realignments 
therefore  we are investing in capability and training while simplifying and clarifying roles and responsibilities 
value drivers of our business we believe that executing our strategic initiatives creates value 
consistent with a commitment to effective execution  our company focuses on three key value drivers profitable growth  leveraging operating and marketing investments and efficient capital structure 
profitable growth 
we believe strong brands properly supported by marketing and innovation  leveraged across markets and targeted to a broad consumer base drive profitable growth 
our company continues to broaden our family of brands 
in particular  we are expanding and growing our noncarbonated offerings to provide more alternatives to consumers 
with this expansion and growth  our company is focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins 
we further intend to focus on improving margins in faster growing but lower margin countries 
to manage this expansion and growth  we have shifted from a volume focus to a volume and value focus 
we believe that tailored brand  package  price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth 
we are implementing these strategies to accelerate profitable growth through close alignment with our bottling partners 
leveraging operating and marketing investments 
we intend to drive increased efficiency by leveraging our operating and marketing investments 
a principal focus to achieve this leverage will continue to be efficiency in the supply chain 
in  our company and our bottling partners established supply chain management companies to help increase procurement efficiencies and centralize production and logistics operations in north america  japan and china 
in  the coca cola system began to realize some of the benefits from these initiatives 
lowering supply chain costs improves system economics 
alignment with our bottling partners on ways to achieve additional joint savings represents a critical area of focus for and beyond 
in the future  our company  together with our bottling partners  will continue to look for opportunities to leverage expenses by working to reduce duplication of efforts  consolidating operations  increasing in market execution  simplifying the decision making process and increasing our speed to market 
efficient capital structure 
our capital structure is intended to optimize our cost of capital 
we believe our strong capital position  our access to key financial markets  our ability to raise funds at a low effective cost and our overall low cost of borrowing provide a competitive advantage 
as our cash flow increases  we expect to increase our share repurchases 
furthermore  the dividend rate increased for the rd straight year in  and we believe that for the foreseeable future  our board of directors intends to increase our dividends 
refer to the heading financial strategies and risk management 
measurements of financial performance we believe these value drivers  when properly leveraged  will result in maintaining or improving our gross profit margin  providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues  and optimizing our cost of capital 
the ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations 
net operating revenues  gross profit  operating income  income before income taxes and net income per share are key measurements of our operating performance 
in  net operating revenues totaled approximately billion  a percent increase from gross profit totaled approximately billion in  an percent increase from operating income was approximately billion  a percent increase from income before income taxes was approximately billion  a percent increase from net income per share basic and diluted was for  a percent increase from these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in and beyond 
refer to the heading operations review 
liquidity and capital resources 
in  our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately billion  a percent increase from for years through  we expect our cumulative net cash provided by operating activities to be in excess of billion 
we believe this is one of our company s strengths the ability to generate significant cash flows to reinvest in our business 
we utilize our cash in ways that the board of directors and management believe provide the greatest shareowner value 
principal uses of our cash flows are share repurchases 
in  share repurchases were approximately billion  and we expect share repurchases to be at least billion 
dividends 
in  dividends were approximately billion  and we anticipate that the total dividends paid will again increase in capital expenditures 
in  capital expenditures were million  and we expect capital expenditures to again be less than billion 
refer to the heading liquidity  capital resources and financial position 
challenges  risks and opportunities operating in more than countries provides unique opportunities for our company 
challenges and risks accompany these opportunities 
our company s strengths  strategic initiatives and value drivers provide the foundation for our response to the challenges  risks and opportunities before us 
looking forward  management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company 
of these  four key challenges and risks are discussed below 
obesity and inactive lifestyles 
increasing consumer  public health and government awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry 
we recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem 
our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line  which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages  juices and juice drinks  sports drinks and water products 
our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace  supporting programs to encourage physical activity and to promote nutrition education  and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation  choice and variety 
we are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments  educators and consumers through science based solutions and programs 
as part of that commitment  in  our company created the beverage institute for health wellness the institute  which is based in houston  texas 
the institute is an organization that supports scientific research  education and outreach with a primary focus on beverages 
the institute supports research to help better understand the role that beverages can play in diets and health in both developed and developing countries around the world 
this effort may lead to the creation of new beverage products by the company in addition to providing health and nutrition education 
water quality and quantity 
water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our company s attention and collaboration with the beverage industry  governments  nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate 
water is the main ingredient in every product the beverage industry offers 
it is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from over exploitation  increasing pollution and poor management 
our company and the beverage industry are in an excellent position to share the water expertise we have developed in the communities we serve in source management  unique multiple barrier water treatment  advanced wastewater treatment systems  rainwater harvesting and use of emerging innovative technologies such as desalination 
as demand for water continues to increase around the world  we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long term stewardship of this critical natural resource 
evolving consumer preferences 
consumers want more choices 
we are impacted by shifting customer demographics and needs  on the go lifestyles  aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever 
we are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products 
we are also committed to providing consumers with a wide variety of choices to meet these needs  desires and lifestyle choices 
increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace 
our company is facing strong competition from some well established global companies and many local players 
we must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverage industry and re energize our marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and share 
all four of these challenges and risks obesity and inactive lifestyles  water quality and quantity  evolving consumer preferences and increased competition have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the beverage industry and on our company  however  we believe our company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks 
financial strategies and risk management the following strategies are intended to optimize our cost of capital 
we consider these strategies to be of critical importance in pursuing our goal of maximizing shareowner value 
debt financing our company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow  interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital 
we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital  which increases our return on shareowners equity 
as of december   our long term debt was rated a by standard poor s and aa by moody s  and our commercial paper program was rated a and p by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
in assessing our credit strength  both standard poor s and moody s consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the company and certain bottlers  including cce and coca cola hbc 
while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers  the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company s business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable 
if our credit ratings were reduced by the rating agencies  our interest expense could increase 
additionally  if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline  the company s share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers 
the rating agencies monitor our interest coverage ratio 
rating agencies often exclude unusual items from the calculation  however  we calculated our ratio based on our reported results 
generally  this ratio is computed as income before taxes plus interest expense and capitalized interest divided by the sum of interest expense and capitalized interest 
our interest coverage ratios were x  x and x  respectively  for the years ended december   and refer to the heading reconciliation of non gaap financial measures 
we monitor our interest coverage ratio and  as previously indicated  the rating agencies consider our ratio in assessing our credit ratings 
however  as described above  the rating agencies aggregate financial data for certain bottlers with our company when assessing our debt rating 
as such  the key measure to rating agencies is the aggregate interest coverage ratio of the company and certain bottlers 
both standard poor s and moody s employ different aggregation methodologies and have different thresholds for the aggregate interest coverage ratio 
these thresholds are not necessarily permanent nor are they fully disclosed to our company 
our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world  enabling us to raise funds with a low effective cost 
this posture  coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt  results in a lower overall cost of borrowing 
our debt management policies  in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity  can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets 
in managing our use of debt  we also monitor the following financial measures december  net debt in billions net debt to net capital ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x refer to the heading reconciliation of non gaap financial measures 
our company monitors the financial measures discussed above in conjunction with our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt and other business and financial risks 
the above financial measures trended positively in and  reflecting improved business results and effective capital management strategies 
share repurchases in october  our board of directors authorized a plan the plan to repurchase up to million shares of our company s common stock through the table below presents shares repurchased and average price per share under the plan year ended december  number of shares repurchased in millions average price per share since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in through our current program as of december   we have purchased more than billion shares of our company s common stock 
this represents percent of the shares outstanding as of january  at an average price per share of 
we expect to repurchase at least billion of the company s common stock in because we expect our operating cash flows to increase  we also expect to increase repurchases of the company s common stock in subsequent years 
dividends at its february meeting  our board of directors again increased our quarterly dividend by percent  raising it to per share  equivalent to a full year dividend of per share in this is our rd consecutive annual increase 
our annual common stock dividend was per share  per share and per share in  and  respectively 
the dividend represented a percent increase from  and the dividend represented a percent increase from financial risk management our company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward  over the counter instruments with liquid markets 
foreign currency 
we manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
approximately percent of operating income was generated outside the united states  therefore  weakness in one particular currency is often offset by strengths in others over time 
we use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations 
our company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options principally euro and japanese yen and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities 
we also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations 
interest rates 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  as well as our mix of term debt versus nonterm debt 
this monitoring includes a review of business and other financial risks as noted above 
we also enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks 
value at risk 
we monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems  including value at risk models 
our value at risk calculations use a historical simulation model to estimate potential future losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that could occur as a result of adverse movements in foreign currency and interest rates 
we have not considered the potential impact of favorable movements in foreign currency and interest rates on our calculations 
we examined historical weekly returns over the previous years to calculate our value at risk 
the average value at risk represents the simple average of quarterly amounts over the past year 
as a result of our foreign currency value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and other financial instruments  over a one week period  would decline by less than million  million and million  respectively  using  or average fair values and by less than million and million  respectively  using december  and fair values 
according to our interest rate value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that any increase in our net interest expense due to an adverse move in our average or in our december  interest rates over a one week period would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our december  and estimates were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies management discussed with our audit committee the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
basis of presentation and consolidation our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our company is the primary beneficiary 
refer to note for a discussion of variable interest entities 
we use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
our consolidated net income includes our company s share of the net earnings of these companies 
the difference between consolidation and the equity method impacts certain financial ratios because of the presentation of the detailed line items reported in the financial statements 
however  our consolidated net income for the period and our shareowners equity at the end of the period are the same whether the investment in the company is accounted for under the equity method or the company is consolidated 
our judgments regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment include considering key factors such as our ownership interest  representation on the board of directors  participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions 
we use the cost method to account for investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
in accordance with the cost method  these investments are recorded at cost or fair value  as appropriate 
we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared 
our company eliminates from financial results all significant intercompany transactions  including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees 
effective february  our company acquired control of coca cola erfrischungsgetraenke ag cceag  the largest bottler of the company s beverage products in germany 
under our policy  we concluded that cceag should be consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to february  our company accounted for cceag under the equity method of accounting 
at that time  our company had approximately percent ownership interest in the outstanding shares of cceag 
in february  in accordance with the terms of the control and profit and loss transfer agreement cpl  our company obtained control of cceag for a period of up to five years 
furthermore  we also entered into a pooling agreement with certain shareowners of cceag that provided our company with voting control of cceag 
in return for control of cceag  the company guaranteed annual payments in lieu of dividends by cceag  to all other cceag shareowners 
additionally  all other cceag shareowners entered into either a put or a put call option agreement with the company  exercisable at any time up to december  our company entered into either put or put call agreements for shares representing an approximately percent interest in cceag 
the spread in the strike prices of the put and call options is approximately percent 
because the terms of the cpl transferred control and all the economic risks and rewards of cceag to the company immediately  we determined consolidation was appropriate 
refer to note in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation or fin 
we adopted interpretation on march  refer to note recoverability of noncurrent assets management s assessment of the recoverability of noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates 
the assessments reflect management s best assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include  among others  sales volume  prices  inflation  cost of capital  marketing spending  foreign currency exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
these factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties  however  the assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used in the current period  the balances for noncurrent assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
operating in more than countries subjects our company to many uncertainties and risks related to various economic  political and regulatory environments 
refer to the headings our business challenges  risks and opportunities and forward looking statements 
as a result  many assumptions must be made by management when determining the recoverability of noncurrent assets 
for the noncurrent assets listed in the table below  we perform tests of impairment  as appropriate 
for applicable assets  we perform tests when certain conditions exist that may indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for other assets  we perform tests at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired december  carrying value percentage of total assets in millions except percentages tested for impairment when conditions exist that indicate carrying value may not be recoverable equity method investments  cost method investments  principally bottling companies other assets  property  plant and equipment  net  amortized intangible assets  net various  principally trademarks total  tested for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an asset may be impaired trademarks with indefinite lives  goodwill  bottlers franchise rights other intangible assets not subject to amortization total  many of the noncurrent assets listed above are located in markets that we consider to be developing or to have changing political environments 
these markets include germany  where the nonreturnable deposit law creates uncertainty  the middle east and egypt  where political and civil unrest continues  india  where affordability remains an issue  and certain markets in latin america  asia and africa where local economic and political conditions are unstable 
in many of these markets  the company has bottling assets and investments 
the list below reflects the company s carrying value of noncurrent assets which  by nature  involve inherent risks not relevant to assets located in developed or stable markets 
december  carrying value percentage of applicable line item above in millions except percentages tested for impairment when conditions exist that indicate carrying value may not be recoverable equity method investments cost method investments  principally bottling companies other assets property  plant and equipment  net  amortized intangible assets  net various  principally trademarks total  tested for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an asset may be impaired trademarks with indefinite lives goodwill bottlers franchise rights other intangible assets not subject to amortization total equity method and cost method investments 
every reporting period the company reviews its equity and cost method investments to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment 
when such events or changes occur  the company evaluates the fair value compared to the carrying value of the related investments 
the company also performs this evaluation every reporting period for any investments for which the carrying value has exceeded the fair value 
for most publicly traded investments  the fair value of our company s investment is often readily available based on quoted market prices 
for non publicly traded investments  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows  estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals  as appropriate 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows  especially in developing and unstable markets  may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  management may be required to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
management s assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the valuation methodologies discussed above  our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
we consider our equity method investees to be strategic long term investments  therefore  we generally complete our assessments with a long term viewpoint 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
management s assessments of fair value in accordance with these valuation methodologies represent our best estimates as of the time of the impairment review and are consistent with our internal planning 
if different fair values were estimated  this could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the difference between calculated fair values  based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares  and our company s carrying values for significant publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investees in millions december  fair value carrying value difference coca cola enterprises inc    coca cola femsa  sa de sa  coca cola amatil limited  coca cola hellenic bottling company sa   grupo continental  sa coca cola embonor sa coca cola bottling company consolidated coca cola west japan company ltd 
embotelladoras polar sa the current decline in value is considered to be temporary 
other assets 
our company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume 
additionally  our company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the applicable period 
advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights 
payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of these assets by preparing estimates of sales volume  gross profit  cash flows and other factors 
if the assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to be not recoverable  such assets are written down as appropriate 
property  plant and equipment 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment should be assessed 
such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses 
if an event occurs or changes in circumstances are present  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
such tests for impairment are also required for intangible assets recorded by our equity method investees 
our trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable  we review such trademarks and other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
we test such trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform tests for impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
such tests include comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments including cash flow analyses  estimates of sales proceeds and independent appraisals 
where applicable  we use an appropriate discount rate  based on the company s cost of capital rate or location specific economic factors 
in  our company recorded impairment charges related to intangible assets of approximately million  primarily related to franchise rights at cceag in the europe  eurasia and middle east operating segment 
the cceag impairment was the result of our revised outlook for the german market  which has been unfavorably impacted by volume declines resulting from market shifts away from our branded products related to the deposit law on nonreturnable beverage packages and the corresponding lack of availability of our products in the discount retail channel 
the deposit law in germany has led to discount chains creating proprietary packages that can only be returned to their own stores 
these proprietary packages are continuing to gain market share and customer acceptance 
we determined the amount of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the current carrying value 
fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes 
because the fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets  we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value 
these impairment charges are recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income for our company is evaluating our strategies for the german operations  including addressing significant structural issues that limit the system s ability to respond effectively to the evolving retail and consumer landscape  assessing market changes and determining our expectations related to the political environment 
we have concluded that  in order to better serve our customers and control the costs in our supply chain  we need to simplify our bottling and distribution operations in germany and work toward a single bottler system 
as a result  we have informed our independent bottling partners in germany that their bottlers agreements will not be renewed when they expire  from through further changes in our business plan  the political environment or market shifts could result in future charges 
management will continue to monitor these factors 
at the end of  the german government passed an amendment to the mandatory deposit legislation that will require retailers  including discount chains  to accept returns of each type of non refillable beverage containers which they sell  regardless of where the beverage container type was purchased 
in addition  the mandatory deposit requirement was expanded to other beverage categories 
the amendment allows for a transition period to enable manufacturers and retailers to establish a national take back system for non refillable containers 
the transition period is expected to last at least until mid therefore  we expect to continue to be a challenging time for our business in germany 
income tax expense and accruals our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves at the time that we determine that it is probable that we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable 
such liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued income taxes in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
additionally  undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction 
the company has formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable jurisdictions 
should we change our plans  we would be required to record a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act was signed into law 
the jobs creation act includes a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an effective percent tax rate 
such repatriations must occur in either an enterprise s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment 
the fasb staff believes that the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the jobs creation act and the timing of the enactment necessitate a practical exception to the sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
requirement to reflect the effect of a new tax law in the period of enactment 
accordingly  an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs creation act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
our company is currently considering the effects of the repatriation provisions of the jobs creation act 
as of december   management had not decided on whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings under the jobs creation act and  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for do not reflect any provision for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings that may be repatriated under the jobs creation act 
in  our company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million as a result of the realization of certain tax credits related to other provisions of the jobs creation act 
the company estimates our effective tax rate for will be approximately percent 
this estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of the jobs creation act and any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in any future period 
refer to note contingencies our company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings 
refer to note due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
management believes that any liability to the company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company taken as a whole 
the company is a party to various legal proceedings in which we are seeking to be reimbursed for costs that we have incurred in the past 
although none of these reimbursements has been realized at this time  the company expects final resolution of certain matters in management believes that any gains to the company that may arise as a result of the final resolutions of these matters will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company taken as a whole

company wide gallon sales growth of percent was in line with unit case volume growth 
however  in north america  gallon sales increased by percent in compared to while unit case volume was flat in due to lower gallon sales in  additional shipments related to new product introductions  changes in our shipping routes and higher than expected year end sales 
gallon sales in asia were percent behind unit case volume due to structural changes that took place in see discussion below 
gallon sales and unit case volume are not necessarily equal during any given period 
items such as seasonality  bottlers inventory practices  supply point changes  timing of price increases and new product introductions can create differences between gallon sales and unit case volume 
for a more detailed discussion on unit case volume  refer to the heading volume 
structural changes refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling or canning operations  and consolidation or deconsolidation of entities for accounting purposes 
effective october   the company and all of our bottling partners in japan created a nationally integrated supply chain management company to centralize procurement  production and logistics operations for the entire coca cola system in japan 
as a result  a portion of our company s business has essentially been converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model 
this shift of certain products to a concentrate business model resulted in reductions in our revenues and cost of goods sold  each in the same amount 
this change in the business model did not impact gross profit 
the decrease in net revenues from to attributable to the japan structural change was approximately million  which was partially offset by an approximately million increase in revenues associated with the consolidation as of march  of certain bottling operations that are considered variable interest entities 
refer to note the impact of currency fluctuations versus the us dollar in was driven primarily by the stronger euro which favorably impacted the europe  eurasia and middle east operating segment  and the stronger yen which favorably impacted the asia operating segment

we own a controlling percent interest in the joint venture company  with a license for the use of the dannon and sparkletts brands as well as ownership of several value brands 
also in the third quarter of  we entered into a master distribution agreement for the evian water brand in the united states and canada 
gallons shipped in increased when compared to as a result of owning and operating these businesses throughout compared to only owning and operating them for a portion of structural changes resulted in a decrease in net operating revenues in compared to due partially to the deconsolidation of cosmos bottling corporation cbc during the second quarter of and the creation of a national supply chain company in japan effective october  as discussed above 
this decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of one additional month of revenue from cceag 
cceag was consolidated in february  therefore  the period contained only months of cceag revenues versus the full year in the size and timing of structural changes  including acquisitions or disposition of bottling and canning operations  do not occur consistently from period to period 
as a result  anticipating the impact of such events on future increases or decreases in net operating revenues and other financial statement line items usually is not possible 
however  we expect to continue to sell bottling and canning interests and buy bottling and canning interests in limited circumstances and  as a result  structural changes will continue to affect our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
the impact of currency fluctuations versus the us dollar in was driven primarily by the stronger euro which favorably impacted the europe  eurasia and middle east operating segment and the stronger yen which favorably impacted the asia operating segment

the decrease in gross profit margin versus was primarily the result of the inclusion of higher revenue  lower margin cceag  ccda and evian results for the full year of these results were partially offset by the creation of the nationally integrated supply chain management company in japan  the deconsolidation of cbc during the second quarter of and the receipt during the first quarter of of a settlement of approximately million from certain defendants in a vitamin antitrust litigation

refer to notes and volume we measure our sales volume in two ways gallons and unit cases of finished products 
gallons is a unit of measurement for concentrates sometimes referred to as beverage bases  syrups  finished beverages and powders in all cases  expressed in equivalent gallons of syrup for all beverage products which are reportable as unit case volume 
most of our revenues are based on gallon sales  as discussed under item and the heading operations review net operating revenues 
unit cases is a unit of measurement equal to us fluid ounces of finished beverage eight ounce servings 
unit case volume represents the number of unit cases of licensed beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the coca cola system to customers 
unit case volume is derived based on estimates supplied by our bottling partners and distributors 
gallon sales and unit case volume are not necessarily equal during any given period 
items such as seasonality  bottlers inventory practices  supply point changes  timing of price increases and new product introductions can create differences between gallon sales and unit case volume 
although most of our company s revenues are not based directly on unit case volume  we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level 
the coca cola system sold approximately billion unit cases of our products in and approximately billion unit cases in approximate and unit case volume growth results are as follows percentage change vs

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements 
in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discussion addresses each of the above items for our company 
on december   our company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of million 
management concluded that the likelihood of any material amounts being paid by our company is not probable 
as of december   we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity  and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
additionally  our company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to notes and in december  we granted a million standby line of credit to coca cola femsa with normal market terms 
as of december   no amounts have been drawn against this line of credit 
this standby letter of credit expires in december our company has equity ownership interests in bottlers that we account for under the equity method of accounting 
for certain entities  primarily bottlers  our company holds variable interests  such as providing financing and guarantees  in addition to our equity investments 
the results of those entities in which our company holds a variable interest  and where we determined that our company is the primary beneficiary  have been consolidated as of march  our company s investment  plus any loans and guarantees  related to these variable interest entities totaled approximately million at december   representing our maximum exposure to loss 
aggregate contractual obligations 
as of december   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows in millions payments due by period total and thereafter short term loans and notes payable commercial paper borrowings   lines of credit and other short term borrowings current maturities of long term debt   long term debt  estimated interest payments  marketing and other commitments  purchase commitments     other long term liabilities liability to cceag shareowners   miscellaneous total contractual obligations    refer to note for information regarding short term loans and notes payable 
upon payment of commercial paper borrowings  we typically expect to issue new commercial paper borrowings 
lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs  especially at international subsidiaries 
refer to note for information regarding long term debt 
we expect to settle such long term debt by several options including cash flows from operations  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt 
we calculated estimated interest payments for short term loans and notes payable and long term debt as follows for fixed rate debt and term debt  we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates  for variable rate debt and or nonterm debt  we estimated interest rates and payment dates based on our determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument  we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short term borrowings 
we expect to fund these marketing and other commitments with cash flows from operations 
we have excluded expected payments for volume related programs  such as payments to unconsolidated bottlers or customers that are generally determined and committed to on an annual basis 
the purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
the amount represents the estimated cash to be paid to cceag shareowners 
refer to note for a discussion of the present value of our liability to cceag shareowners 
we will consider several options to settle this liability including cash flows from operations  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december  was  million 
refer to note this accrued liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets 
because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs  we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 
we fund our us qualified pension plans in accordance with employee retirement income security act regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and in accordance with internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the minimum required contribution for our primary qualified us pension plan for the plan year is and is anticipated to remain for at least the next several years due to large contributions made to the plan over the past four years 
therefore  we did not include any amounts as a contractual obligation in the above table 
we do however  anticipate contributing up to the maximum deductible amount to the primary us qualified pension plan in  which is estimated to be approximately million 
furthermore  we expect to contribute up to million to the us postretirement health care benefit plan during we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operations 
our international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
we do not expect contributions to these plans to be material in or thereafter 
therefore  no amounts have been included in the table above 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of plan assets was  million 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was million 
the majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non us employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions  as well as our unfunded us nonqualified pension plans 
these us nonqualified pension plans provide  for certain members of management  benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code 
disclosure of amounts in the above table regarding expected benefit payments for our unfunded pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected for and thereafter due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans 
however  in order to inform the reader about expected benefit payments for these plans over the next several years  we anticipate annual benefit payments to be in the range of approximately million to million in and remain at or near this annual level for the next several years 
deferred income tax liabilities as of december  were million 
refer to note this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have any connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
minority interests of million as of december  for consolidated entities in which we do not have a percent ownership interest were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities 
such minority interests are not liabilities requiring the use of cash or other resources  therefore  this amount is excluded from the contractual obligations table 
exchange our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations and governmental actions 
we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments and to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we use functional currencies 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are often offset by strengths in others 
in  and  the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducts operations all operating currencies  and for certain individual currencies  strengthened weakened against the us dollar as follows year ended december  all operating currencies australian dollar british pound euro japanese yen mexican peso south african rand these percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results 
our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange rates on net income and earnings per share 
the total currency impact on operating income  including the effect of our hedging activities  was an increase of approximately percent and percent in and  respectively 
the impact of a stronger us dollar decreased our operating income by approximately percent in in  the company expects to receive a minimal benefit from currency exchange fluctuations 
exchange gains losses net amounted to million in  million in and million in and were recorded in other income loss net in our consolidated statements of income 
exchange gains losses net include the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies and the costs of hedging certain exposures of our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note overview of financial position our consolidated balance sheet as of december   compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of december   was impacted by the following the increase in cash and cash equivalents of  million was due primarily to net cash provided by operating activities of  million in a significant portion of this cash was generated in locations outside the united states and the majority of our cash balances are held in locations outside the united states 
as a result of the jobs creation act  the company has elected to maintain significant cash balances at its international locations principally in ireland while the company evaluates the potential impact of the tax legislation 
refer to note the increase in loans and notes payable of  million was due to the issuance of commercial paper during to meet short term cash needs in the united states  including the quarterly dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 
the increase in our equity method investments in of million was primarily due to the impact of the strength in most key currencies versus the us dollar and an increase of equity income  net of dividends 
refer to note the increase in buildings and improvements of approximately million and machinery and equipment of approximately million was primarily due to positive currency translation adjustments  offset by the sale of production assets in japan with a carrying value of million 
refer to note the overall increase in total assets as of december   compared to december   was primarily related to the increase in cash and cash equivalents mentioned above  which impacted the corporate operating segment  and the impact of the strength in most key currencies versus the us dollar  especially a stronger euro that impacted our europe  eurasia and middle east operating segment and a stronger japanese yen that impacted our asia operating segment  partially offset by million primarily related to impairment charges for franchise rights and manufacturing investments and the sale of production assets in japan 
refer to the heading other operating charges for a discussion of the impairment charges 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world 
in general  we believe that over time we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability

forward looking statements certain written and oral statements made by our company and subsidiaries or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of our company may constitute forward looking statements as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements made in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
generally  the words believe  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  project  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which generally are not historical in nature 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including statements relating to volume growth  share of sales and earnings per share growth and statements expressing general optimism about future operating results are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our company s historical experience and our present expectations or projections 
as and when made  management believes that these forward looking statements are reasonable 
however  caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following are some of the factors that could cause our company s actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in or underlying our company s forward looking statements economic and political conditions  especially in international markets  including civil unrest  product boycotts  governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders 
without limiting the preceding sentence  the current unstable economic and political conditions and civil unrest in the middle east  north korea  india or elsewhere  the unstable situation in iraq  or the continuation or escalation of terrorism could have adverse impacts on our company s business results or financial condition 
changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment 
these include  without limitation  changes in consumer preferences  including changes based on health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns  shifting consumer developments and needs  changes in consumer lifestyles and increased consumer information  competitive product and pricing pressures  and our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the global market as a result of actions by competitors 
factors such as these could impact our earnings  share of sales and volume growth 
foreign currency rate fluctuations  interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions 
most of our exposures to capital and financial markets conditions  including exposures to foreign currency and interest rates fluctuations  are managed on a consolidated basis  which allows us to net certain exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets 
we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to financial risks 
there can be no assurance  however  that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to capital and financial markets 
beverage container related deposit  recycling  eco tax and or product stewardship laws and regulations  if they are adopted and implemented at a large scale in any of the markets in which we operate  on a cumulative basis may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
significant additional labeling or warning requirements  if they become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulation  may inhibit sales of such major product or products and may materially harm our business 
changes in commercial or market practices and business models within the european union as a result of changes to  or evolving interpretations of  european commission competition laws and regulations  as well as commitments or undertakings we made or may make in the future in connection with european commission inquiries or investigations  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in europe 
the uncertainties of litigation and other legal proceedings 
adverse weather conditions  which could reduce demand for company products 
the effectiveness of our advertising  marketing and promotional programs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials  the cost of energy  transportation and other necessary services  our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  and our ability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters  power outages  labor strikes or the like 
our ability to effectively align ourselves with our bottling system as we focus on increasing the investment in our brands  seeking efficiencies throughout the supply chain  delivering more value for our customers  and better meeting the needs of our consumers 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations  laws concerning food and beverages  competition laws  employment laws and environmental laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions 
our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets  which also depends on economic and political conditions  and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local bottlers and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities  distribution networks  sales equipment and technology 
moreover  the supply of products in developing markets must match customers demand for those products  and due to product price and cultural differences  there can be no assurance of product acceptance in any particular market 
water quality and quantity 
water is a limited resource facing unprecedented challenges from over exploitation  increasing pollution and poor management 
as demand for water continues to increase around the world and as the quality of the available water deteriorates  our system may incur increasing production costs  which may materially adversely affect our company s profitability in the long run 
our ability to achieve earnings forecasts  which are generated based on projected volumes and sales of many product types  some of which are more profitable than others 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the projected level or mix of product sales 
other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our company s securities and exchange commission filings
