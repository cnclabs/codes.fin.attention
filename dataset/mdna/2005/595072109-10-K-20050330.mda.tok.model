overview the company is a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services in amounts generally ranging from to  with an historical average amount financed of approximately  the company primarily leases point of sale pos authorization systems and other small business equipment to small commercial enterprises 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from leases originated and held by the company  payments on service contracts  rental payments  and fee income 
historically  the company has funded the majority of leases  contracts and loans through its revolving credit and term loan facilities the credit facilities and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent  its subordinated debt program subordinated debt and internally generated funds 
between october and september  an interruption in the company s financing sources had a significant impact on its ability to find new contracts 
as of september   the company s then existing credit facility failed to renew and the company began paying down the balance of the debt 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its credit facility and securitization agreements 
these covenants required the company to maintain certain ratios of fixed charges to consolidated earnings  a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and compliance with a borrowing base 
in april  the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waived the defaults described above  and in consideration for the waiver  required the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
the company also received a waiver for the covenant violations in connection with the securitization agreement and amended the securitization agreement to conform the covenants therein to the covenants in the senior credit facility 
in october  the company was forced to suspend virtually all new contract originations until a new source of financing could be obtained or until such time as the credit facility had been paid in full 
in june  microfinancial secured a million credit facility  comprised of a one year million line of credit and a million three year subordinated note  that enabled the company to resume microticket contract originations 
in conjunction with raising new capital  the company also inaugurated a new wholly owned operating subsidiary  timepayment corp 
llc 
on september   microfinancial 
table of contents secured a three year  million  senior secured revolving line of credit from cit commercial services  a unit of cit group 
this line of credit replaced the previous one year  million line of credit obtained in june under more favorable terms and conditions 
in addition  it retired the existing outstanding debt with the former bank group 
the new financing has enabled the company to resume origination of contracts 
in a typical lease transaction  the company originates leases through its network of independent dealers 
upon approval of a lease application by the company and verification that the lessee has both received the equipment and signed the lease  the company pays the dealer the cost of the equipment  plus the dealer s profit margin 
in a typical transaction for the acquisition of service contracts  a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon credit approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  the company purchases from the dealer the right to the payment stream under that monitoring contract at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by the company are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  the company is scheduled to receive payments sufficient  in the aggregate  to cover the company s borrowing costs and the costs of the underlying equipment  and to provide the company with an appropriate profit 
the company enhances the profitability of its leases  contracts and loans by charging late fees  prepayment penalties  loss and damage waiver fees and other service fees  when applicable 
collection fees are imposed based on the company s estimate of the costs of collection 
the company may only impose late fees on the first four months of late payments and is prohibited from imposing compound late fees or from assessing late fees as a percentage of the total outstanding late payments including outstanding late fees 
the loss and damage waiver fees are charged if a customer fails to provide proof of insurance and are reasonably related to the cost of replacing the lost or damaged equipment or product 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides the company with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment financed at the end of the initial term of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in the company s portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  substantially all service and rental contracts are month to month contracts with expected terms of years for service contracts  months for lessees that continue to rent their equipment beyond the original term  and months for other types of rental contracts 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
the company determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company identified its most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  maintaining the allowance for credit losses and determining provisions for income taxes 
these accounting policies are discussed below as well as within the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in the opinion of management  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  the company may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interests is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
at the end of the lease term  contractually  the lessee has the option to either buy the equipment at a price quoted by the company  return the equipment or continue to rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
if the lessee continues to rent the equipment  the company records an investment in rental contracts at estimated 
table of contents residual value and recognizes revenue and depreciation based on the methodology described below 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  and service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans are recognized as they are earned 
the company s investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the service period 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in service contracts 
the company s investment in rental contracts is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
rental income from monthly billings is recognized on a monthly basis as the customer continues to rent the equipment 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in rental contracts 
loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance 
interest income on loans is recognized as it is earned 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on its investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans at an amount that it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolio 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of the historical loss experience of the company and the level of recourse provided by such lease  service contract  rental contract or loan  if any  and reflects management s judgment of additional loss potential considering current economic conditions and the nature and characteristics of the underlying lease portfolio 
the company determines the necessary periodic provision for credit losses taking into account actual and expected losses in the portfolio as a whole and the relationship of the allowance to the net investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans 
such provisions generally represent a percentage of funded amounts of leases  contracts and loans 
the resulting charge is included in the provision for credit losses 
leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses and are put on non accrual when they are deemed to be uncollectable 
generally  the company deems leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans to be uncollectable when one of the following occurs i the obligor files for bankruptcy  ii the obligor dies  and the equipment is returned  or iii when an account has become days delinquent without contact with the lessee 
historically  the typical monthly payment under the company s leases has been between and per month 
as a result of these small monthly payments  the company s experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current at days past due  a lessee may only owe lease payments of between and the company has developed and regularly updates proprietary credit scoring systems designed to improve its risk based pricing 
the company uses credit scoring in most  but not all  of its extensions of credit 
in addition  the company employs collection procedures and a legal process to resolve any credit problems 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  for example  leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with estimates in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
differences between the basis of assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent management believes recovery is more likely than not  no valuation allowance is deemed necessary 

table of contents results of operations revenue change change in thousands income on financing leases and loans rental income income on service contracts service fees and other total revenues the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned

exposure to credit losses the following table sets forth certain information as of december   and with respect to delinquent leases  service contracts and loans 
the percentages in the table below represent the aggregate on such date of the actual amounts not paid on each invoice by the number of days past due  rather than the entire balance of a delinquent receivable  over the cumulative amount billed at such date from the date of origination on all leases  service contracts  and loans in the company s portfolio 
for example  if a receivable is days past due  the portion of the receivable that is over days past due will be placed in the days past due category  the portion of the receivable which is over days past due will be placed in the days past due category and the portion of the receivable which is over days past due will be placed in the over days past due category 
the company historically used this methodology of calculating its delinquencies because of its experience that lessees who miss a payment do not necessarily default on the entire lease 
accordingly  the company includes only the amount past due rather than the entire lease receivable in each category 
as of december  dollars in thousands cumulative amounts billed days past due days past due over days past due total past due 
table of contents alternatively  the amounts in the table below represent the balance of delinquent receivables on an exposure basis for all leases  rental contracts  and service contracts in the company s portfolio as of december  an exposure basis aging classifies the entire receivable based on the invoice that is the most delinquent 
for example  in the case of a rental or service contract  if a receivable is days past due  all amounts billed and unpaid are placed in the over days past due category 
in the case of lease receivables  where the minimum contractual obligation of the lessee is booked as a receivable at the inception of the lease  if a receivable is days past due  the entire receivable  including all amounts billed and unpaid as well as the minimum contractual obligation yet to be billed  will be placed in the over days past due category 
december  dollars in thousands current days past due days past due over days past due gross receivables due in installments liquidity and capital resources general the company s lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new lease originations 
since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities  its on balance sheet securitizations  the issuance of subordinated debt and an initial public offering completed in february of the company will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand its volume of leases  and contracts funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
additionally  the company s uses of cash include the payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under its credit facilities and securitizations  payment of selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
for the years ended december  and december   respectively  the company s primary source of liquidity was cash provided by operating activities due to the unavailability of a credit facility between october and june see overview above 
the company generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december  and million for year ended december  the company used net cash in investing activities of  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investing activities primarily relate to the origination of new leases and contracts as well as capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  financing activities include net borrowings and repayments on our various financing sources 
the company believes that cash flows from its existing portfolio and available borrowings on the existing credit facility will be sufficient to support the company s operations and lease origination activity for the foreseeable future

the term notes were a one time funding  without any ability for the company to draw down additional amounts 
subordinated notes are generally one time fundings  without any ability for the company to draw down additional amounts 
on september   the company entered into a three year senior secured revolving line of credit with cit commercial services  a unit of cit group cit  whereby it may borrow a maximum of million based upon qualified lease receivables 
outstanding borrowings with respect to the revolving line of credit bear interest based at prime plus for prime rate loans  or the prevailing rate per annum as offered in the london interbank offered rate libor plus for libor loans

the day libor rate at december  was 
as of december   based on lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula  the company had million in excess availability on the cit line of credit 
prior to obtaining the million secured line of credit discussed above  the company had borrowings outstanding under a million senior credit facility with a group of financial institutions  which had failed to renew as of september  while cash flows from its portfolio and other fees had been sufficient to repay amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility  securitizations and subordinated debt  in october  the company was forced to suspend virtually all new contract originations until a new source of liquidity was obtained or until such time as the senior credit facility was paid in full 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its senior credit facility 
these covenants required that the company maintain certain ratios of fixed charges to consolidated earnings  a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  and compliance with a borrowing base 
on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders in which the lenders waived the defaults described above and the company agreed to repay the outstanding balance of the loan over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
as of december   the loan under the senior credit facility had been fully repaid 

table of contents the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  periodically finances its lease and service contracts  together with unguaranteed residuals  through securitizations using special purpose entities 
the assets of such special purpose entities and cash collateral or other accounts created in connection with the financings in which they participate are not available to pay creditors of leasecomm corporation  timepayment corp  llc  microfinancial incorporated  or other affiliates 
however  the special purpose entities to which such assets are required under generally accepted accounting principles to be consolidated in the financial statements of the company 
as a result  such assets and the related liability remain on the balance sheet and do not receive gain on sale treatment 
the amounts borrowed under the securitization were fully repaid as of december  financial covenants the company s secured revolving line of credit with cit has financial covenants that it must comply with in order to obtain funding through the facility and to avoid an event of default 
some of the critical financial covenants under the cit line of credit as of december  include consolidated tangible capital funds not less than million allowance for credit losses of at least of gross lease installments maximum leverage ratio of not more than as of december   management believes that the company was in compliance with all covenants in its borrowing relationships 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has entered into various agreements  such as long term debt agreements  capital lease agreements and operating lease agreements that require future payments be made 
long term debt agreements include all debt outstanding under the securitization  subordinated notes  demand notes and other notes payable

since the company funds on the same day a lease is successfully verified  at any given time  the company has no firm outstanding commitments to lend 
market risk and financial instruments this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings  cash flows  and fair value of the financial instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the implicit yield to the company on all of its leases  contracts and loans is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination of the lease 
when the company originates or acquires leases  contracts  and loans it bases its pricing in part on the spread it expects to achieve between the implicit yield rate to the company on each lease and the effective interest cost it will pay when it finances such leases  contracts and loans through its credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract or loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
the company has adopted a policy designed to protect itself against interest rate volatility during the term of each lease  contract or loan 
given the relatively short average life of the company s leases  contracts and loans  the company s goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
currently  given the restrictions imposed by the company s senior lender on the company s ability to prepay its fixed rate debt  the company is limited in its ability to manage the blend of fixed and variable rate interest obligations 
as of december   the company s outstanding fixed rate indebtedness outstanding under the company s subordinated debt represented of the company s total outstanding indebtedness of million 
the company s credit facility bears interest at rates which fluctuate with changes in the prime rate or the day libor 
the company s interest expense on its credit facility and the fair value of its fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on the company s interest expense and the fair value of its fixed rate debt would be immaterial

our lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new leases  contracts and loans 
we will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand our volume of leases  contracts and loans funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
in addition  until recently we were required to pay down our existing debt under our former credit facility according to an agreed schedule 
as of september   our credit facility failed to renew and consequently  we were forced to suspend substantially all new origination activity as of october  at december   we were in default of certain of our debt covenants in our then existing credit facility

table of contents entered into a long term agreement with our former lenders which waived the defaults described above  and in consideration for this waiver  required the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april in june  we secured a million credit facility  comprised of a one year million line of credit and a million three year subordinated note  that enabled us to resume microticket contract originations 
in conjunction with raising new capital  we formed a wholly owned operating subsidiary  timepayment corp 
llc 
on september   we secured a three year  million  senior secured revolving line of credit from cit commercial services  a unit of cit group 
this line of credit replaced the previous one year  million line of credit obtained in june under more favorable terms and conditions  including  but not limited to  pricing at prime plus or libor plus

our uses of cash include the origination and acquisition of leases  contracts and loans  payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under our credit facilities  subordinated debt and securitizations  payment of selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
any default or other interruption of our external funding could have a material negative effect on our ability to fund new leases and contracts  and would have an adverse effect on our financial results 
the delay in new originations caused by our former credit facility s failure to renew in has decreased the size of our portfolio and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance 
as a result of the failure of our old credit facility to renew  in october  we were forced to suspend virtually all new contract originations until we obtained a source of funding or at such time that the senior credit facility has been paid in full 
during the first half of  we were able to fund a very limited number of new contracts using our own free cash flow 
the amount and timing of the new originations was restricted by both the amount of available cash  and the terms of our banking agreements 
for example  total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december  the decline in revenue was due to decreases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans and million  or  in service fee and other income 
in addition  rental revenue decreased million or and income on service contracts decreased million  or  as compared to such amounts in the previous year s period 
the overall decrease in revenue can be attributed to the decrease in the overall size of our portfolio of leases  rentals and service contracts 
the shrinking portfolio is a direct result of our decision during the third quarter of to cease funding new originations as a result of our former lenders not renewing the revolving credit facility on september  our recently signed credit facilities in june and september have enabled us to resume contract originations 
however  our contract originations may be constrained by the amount of financing available and this may have an adverse affect on our revenues 
even if we have the funding to originate new contracts  the absence of new contract origination from the period beginning in the third quarter of will have an affect on our portfolio and financial performance for some time  since we will not be collecting any payments from leases  contracts and loans that may have originated during that time had there been financing available 
as the average age of the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio increased during that period  a greater portion of payments being made on those loans consisted of principal payments  and a lesser portion consisted of interest  which adversely impacts our revenue 
it may take some time before the new contract and loan originations bring our loan portfolio s average age to the point where it was before we suspended new originations 
in addition  after we ceased funding new originations in  we were required to terminate a number of our front end personnel  such as sales personnel  sales support personnel and credit personnel 
as we begin to originate new contracts and loans in light of our new credit facilities  we may face challenges in rebuilding those competencies through new hires 

table of contents we are vulnerable to changes in the demand for the types of systems we lease or price reductions in such systems 
the majority of our leases are currently for authorization systems for point of sale pos  card based payments by  for example  debit  credit and charge cards 
we also lease a wide variety of other equipment including advertising and display equipment  coffee machines  paging systems  water coolers and restaurant equipment 
reduced demand for financing of these types of equipment  in particular pos authorization systems  could adversely affect our lease volume  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
technological advances may lead to a decrease in the price of these types of systems or equipment and a consequent decline in the need for financing of such equipment 
in addition  for pos authorization systems  business and technological changes could change the manner in which pos authorization is obtained 
these changes could reduce the need for outside financing sources that would reduce our lease financing opportunities and origination volume in such products 
in the event that demand for financing pos authorization systems or other types of equipment that we lease declines  we will need to expand our efforts to provide lease financing for other products 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to do so successfully 
because many dealers specialize in particular products  we may not be able to capitalize on our current dealer relationships in the event we shift our business focus to originating leases of other products 
our failure to successfully enter into new relationships with dealers of other products or to extend existing relationships with such dealers in the event of reduced demand for financing of the systems and equipment we currently lease would have a material adverse effect on us 
even if we had adequate financing  our expansion strategy may be affected by our limited sources for new originations and our inexperience with lending for new products 
our revenue growth since the third quarter of has been severely affected by the failure of our former credit facility to renew and a lack of new financing prior to june even with our new long term line of credit  our principal growth strategy of expansion into new products and markets may be adversely affected by i our inability to re establish old sources or cultivate new sources of originations and ii our inexperience with products with different characteristics from those we currently offer  including the type of obligor and the amount financed 
new sources 
a majority of our leases and contracts are originated through a network of dealers which deal exclusively in pos authorization systems 
we are currently unable to capitalize on these relationships in originating leases for products other than pos authorization systems 
in addition  we have lost contacts with some of our old sources during the time we had suspended new originations 
some of these dealers have found other financing sources during that time 
we may face difficulties in re establishing our relationships with such sources 
our failure to develop additional relationships with dealers of products which we lease or may seek to lease would hinder our growth strategy 
new products 
our existing portfolio primarily consists of leases to owner operated or other small commercial enterprises with little business history and limited or poor personal credit history at the owner level 
these leases are characterized by small average monthly payments for equipment with limited residual value at the end of the lease term 
our ability to successfully underwrite new products with different characteristics is highly dependent on our ability i to successfully analyze the credit risk associated with the user of such new products so as to appropriately apply our risk adjusted pricing to such products and ii to utilize our proprietary software to efficiently service and collect on our portfolio 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage these credit risk issues  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we experience a significant rate of default under our leases  and a higher than expected default rate would have an adverse affect on our cash flow and earnings 
the credit characteristics of our lessee base correspond to a high incidence of delinquencies which in turn may lead to significant levels of defaults 
our receivables which were contractually past due by days or more at december  and december  represented million and million  respectively  
table of contents which represented and  respectively  of the cumulative amount billed at that date from the date of origination on all leases  service contracts and loans in our portfolio 
receivables which were over days past due represented and  respectively  of such cumulative amounts at that date 
under our charge off policy  cumulative net charge offs after recoveries from our inception to december  have totaled of total cumulative receivables plus total billed fees over that period 
the credit profile of our lessees heightens the importance to us of both pricing our leases  loans and contracts for risk assumed  as well as maintaining adequate reserves for losses 
significant defaults by lessees in excess of those we anticipate in setting our prices and reserve levels may adversely affect our cash flow and earnings 
reduced cash flow and earnings could limit our ability to repay debt  obtain financing and effect securitizations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to our usual practice of originating leases through our dealer relationships  from time to time we have purchased lease portfolios from dealers 
while certain of these leases initially do not meet our underwriting standards  we often will purchase the leases once the lessee demonstrates a payment history 
we will only acquire these smaller lease portfolios in situations where the company selling the portfolio will continue to act as a dealer following the acquisition 
we have also completed the acquisition of six large pos authorization system lease and rental portfolios two in  one in  one in  one in and the acquisition of the rental and lease portfolio of resource leasing in we may face adverse consequences of litigation  including consequences of using litigation as part of our collection policy 
our use of litigation as a means of collection of unpaid receivables exposes us to counterclaims on our suits for collection  to class action lawsuits and to negative publicity surrounding our leasing and collection policies 
we have been a defendant in attempted class action suits as well as counterclaims filed by individual obligors in attempts to dispute the enforceability of the lease  contract or loan 
any of this type of litigation may be time consuming and expensive to defend  even if not meritorious  may result in the diversion of management time and attention  and may subject us to significant liability for damages or result in invalidation of our proprietary rights 
we believe our collection policies and use of litigation comply fully with all applicable laws 
because of our persistent enforcement of our leases  contracts and loans through the use of litigation  we may have created ill will toward us on the part of certain lessees and other obligors who were defendants in such lawsuits 
our litigation strategy has generated adverse local publicity in certain circumstances 
adverse publicity at a national level could negatively impact public perception of our business and may materially impact the price of our common stock 
any of these factors could adversely affect our business operations and financial results and condition 
in addition to legal proceedings that may arise out of our business activities  we may face other litigation 
in october  we were served with a purported class action complaint which was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging violations of federal securities law 
the purported class would consist of all persons who purchased our securities between february  and october  the complaint asserts that during this period we made a series of materially false or misleading statements about our business  prospects and operations  including with respect to certain lease provisions  our course of dealings with our vendor dealers  and our reserves for credit losses 
in april  an amended class action complaint was filed which added additional defendants and expanded upon the prior allegations with respect to us 
we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint  which is awaiting decision by the court 
because of the uncertainties inherent in litigation  we cannot predict whether the outcome will have a material adverse effect on us 
increased interest rates may make our leases  contracts or loans less profitable 
since we generally fund our leases  contracts and loans through our credit facilities or from working capital  our operating margins could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates 
the implicit yield to us on all of our leases  contracts and loans is fixed due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination 
when we have in the past originated or acquired leases  contracts and loans  we based our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the implicit 
table of contents yield rate to us on each lease  contract and loan and the effective interest cost we will pay when we finance such leases  contracts and loans 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract and loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  to the extent such lease  contract or loan was financed with floating rate funding 
we may undertake to hedge against the risk of interest rate increases  based on the size and interest rate profile of our portfolio 
such hedging activities  however  would limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio 
in addition  our hedging activities may not protect us from interest rate related risks in all interest rate environments 
adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an economic downturn may cause an increase in defaults under our leases and less demand for the commercial equipment we lease 
further economic downturn could result in a decline in the demand for some of the types of equipment or services which we finance  which could lead additional defaults and to a decline in future originations 
an economic downturn may slow the development and continued operation of small commercial businesses  which are the primary market for pos authorization systems and the other commercial equipment leased by us 
such a downturn could also adversely affect our ability to obtain capital to fund lease  contract and loan originations or acquisitions or to complete securitizations 
in addition  such a downturn could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults by our lessees and other obligors beyond the levels forecasted by us  which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and earnings  as well as on our ability to securitize leases 
these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  as of both december  and  leases in california  florida  texas  massachusetts and new york accounted for approximately of our portfolio 
economic conditions in these states may affect the level of collections from  as well as delinquencies and defaults by  these obligors 
we may not be able to maintain our nyse listing 
in february  we were advised by the new york stock exchange nyse that we were not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards 
specifically  we did not have an average market capitalization of at least million and a share price of at least over a consecutive thirty day trading period 
in accordance with the continued listing criteria set forth by the nyse  on april   we presented a plan which management believed had the potential to bring us back into compliance with the listing standards within the required timeframes 
we were notified in july that we had been reinstated by the nyse as a company in good standing under the nyse listing standards then in effect 
in accordance with the nyse s guidelines  we will be subject to a twelve month follow up period to ensure that we remain in compliance with the nyse continued listing standards 
we have been notified of a proposed rule change by the nyse which would modify the listing standards in a way that may cause us once again to fall under the continued listing standards 
we continue to monitor the status of this proposed rule change  and any effect it might have on our compliance with continued listing standards going forward 
if we are unable to maintain compliance with the nyse listing standards  as they exist now or as they may be changed in the future  we may be required to transfer our listing to another exchange 
we face intense competition  which could cause us to lower our lease rates  hurt our origination volume and strategic position and adversely affect our financial results 
the microticket leasing and financing industry is highly competitive 
we compete for customers with a number of national  regional and local banks and finance companies 
our competitors also include equipment manufacturers that lease or finance the sale of their own products 
while the market for microticket financing has traditionally been fragmented  we could also be faced with competition from small or large ticket leasing companies that could use their expertise in those markets to enter and compete in the microticket financing market 
our competitors include larger  more established companies  some of which may possess substantially greater financial  marketing and operational resources than we  including lower cost of funds and access to 
table of contents capital markets and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us 
if a competitor were to lower lease rates  we could be forced to follow suit or be unable to regain origination volume  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  competitors may seek to replicate the automated processes used by us to monitor dealer performance  evaluate lessee credit information  appropriately apply risk adjusted pricing  and efficiently service a nationwide portfolio 
the development of computer software similar to that developed by us by or for our competitors may jeopardize our strategic position and allow such companies to operate more efficiently than we do 
government regulation could restrict our business 
our leasing business is not currently subject to extensive federal or state regulation 
while we are not aware of any proposed legislation  the enactment of  or a change in the interpretation of  certain federal or state laws affecting our ability to price  originate or collect on receivables such as the application of usury laws to our leases and contracts could negatively affect the collection of income on our leases  contracts and loans  as well as the collection of fee income 
any such legislation or change in interpretation  particularly in massachusetts  whose law governs the majority of our leases  contracts and loans  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to originate leases  contracts and loans at current levels of profitability  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies such as us that are not expedited filers to comply with more stringent internal control system and monitoring requirements beginning in compliance with this new requirement may place an expensive burden and significant time constraint on these companies with limited resources 
we may face risks in acquiring other portfolios and companies  including risks relating to how we finance any such acquisition or how we are able to assimilate any portfolios or operations we acquire 
a portion of our growth strategy depends on the consummation of acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
our inability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or portfolios  or to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  could limit our ability to grow our business 
any major acquisition would require a significant portion of our resources 
the timing  size and success  if at all  of our acquisition efforts and any associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted 
we may finance future acquisitions by using shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of the two 
any acquisition we make using common stock would result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value  or if potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept common stock as part or all of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  we may be required to utilize more of our cash resources  if available  or to incur additional indebtedness in order to initiate and complete acquisitions 
additional debt  as well as the potential amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible assets incurred as a result of any such acquisition  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  certain of our credit facilities and subordinated debt agreements contain covenants that do not permit us to merge or consolidate into or with any other person or entity  issue any shares of our capital stock if  after giving effect to such issuance  certain shareholders cease to own or control specified percentages of our voting capital stock  create or acquire any subsidiaries other than certain permitted special purpose subsidiaries  or implement certain changes to our board of directors 
these provisions could prevent us from making an acquisition using shares of our common stock as consideration 
we also may experience difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of acquired companies  an inability to sustain or improve the historical revenue levels of acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations  and the potential loss of key employees of such acquired companies 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents if we were to lose key personnel  our operating results may suffer or it may cause a default under our debt facilities 
our success depends to a large extent upon the abilities and continued efforts of richard latour  president and chief executive officer and james r 
jackson  jr  vice president and chief financial officer  and our other senior management 
we have entered into employment agreements with mr 
latour and mr 
jackson 
the loss of the services of one or more of the key members of our senior management before we are able to attract and retain qualified replacement personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  under our credit facilities  an event of default would arise if mr 
latour or mr 
jackson were to leave their positions as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  respectively  unless a suitable replacement were appointed within days 
our failure to comply with these provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain provisions of our articles and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a change in control or acquisition of the company 
our restated articles of organization and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder might consider favorable  including i provisions authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  ii providing for a board of directors with staggered terms  iii requiring super majority or class voting to effect certain amendments to the articles and bylaws and to approve certain business combinations  iv limiting the persons who may call special stockholders meetings and v establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders meetings 
in addition  certain provisions of massachusetts law to which we are subject may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or an unsolicited acquisition proposals 
our stock price may be volatile  which could limit our access to the equity markets and could cause you to incur losses on your investment 
since  our common stock has been publicly traded 
our stock has closed at prices ranging from a high of in june to a low of in april if our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if operating expenditures exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the market price of our common stock has been in the past and could in the future be materially and adversely affected for reasons unrelated to our specific business or results of operations 
general market price declines or volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  short term trading strategies of certain investors can also have a significant effect on the price of specific securities 
in addition  the trading price of the common stock may be influenced by a number of factors  including the liquidity of the market for the common stock  investor perceptions of us and the equipment financing industry in general  variations in our quarterly operating results  interest rate fluctuations and general economic and other conditions 
moreover  the stock market recently has experienced significant price and value fluctuations  which have not necessarily been related to corporate operating performance 
the volatility of the stock market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and our ability to raise funds in the public markets 
there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock in the future 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors suspended the future payment of dividends on our common stock to comply with our banking agreements at the time 
we paid no dividends in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  our board of directors announced a resumption of dividend payments with a cash dividend of per share payable to shareholders of record on february  additionally  the company s board of directors announced a second dividend of per share payable on may  to holders of record of microfinancial common stock at the close of business on april  future dividend payments are 
table of contents subject to ongoing quarterly review and evaluation by our board of directors  however 
the decision as to the amount and timing of future dividends we may pay  if any  will be made at the discretion of our board of directors in light of our financial condition  capital requirements  earnings and prospects and any restrictions under our credit facilities or subordinated debt agreements  as well as other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 
we can give you no assurance as to the amount and timing of payment of future dividends
