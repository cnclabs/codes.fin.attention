restatement of financial statements following a review of the company s lease accounting practices in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company corrected its method of accounting for leases related to stores with operating leases 
as a result  the company restated its consolidated balance sheet at february   and its consolidated statements of income  changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for the years ended february  and march  the company also restated its quarterly financial information for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal the company had historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvement asset on the consolidated balance sheets and capital expenditures in investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
management determined that the appropriate interpretation of financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires these allowances to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
additionally  this adjustment results in a reclassification of the deferred rent amortization from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of sales including occupancy costs on the consolidated statements of income 
the company had historically recognized rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing with the retail store opening date 
the store opening date coincided with the commencement of business operations  which is the intended use of the property 
management re evaluated fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  and determined that the lease term should commence on the date the company takes possession of the leased space for construction purposes  which is generally two months prior to a store opening date  and considered a rent holiday period 
excluding tax impacts  the correction of this accounting required the company to record this additional deferred rent in deferred credits from landlords and to adjust retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets  and to correct amortization in costs of sales including occupancy costs on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended february  and march  the cumulative effect of these accounting management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued changes  net of tax effect  was a reduction to retained earnings of million as of the beginning of fiscal and an incremental decrease to retained earnings of 
million  increase of 
million  and decrease of 
million for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the company did not amend its previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  and the financial statements and related information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
see note  restatement of financial statements to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of february   as well as on the company s consolidated statements of income  changes in shareholders equity  and cash flows for fiscal years ended february  and march  the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventory  the potential impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
costs of sales 
costs of sales include the cost associated with acquiring merchandise from vendors  occupancy costs  provision for inventory shortages  and credits and allowances from our merchandise vendors following eitf guidance 
because the company does not include the costs associated with operating the distribution facility and freight within cost of sales  the company s gross profit may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in costs of sales and in the calculation of gross profit 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include store payroll and related payroll benefits  store operating expenses  cooperative advertising allowances following eitf guidance  costs associated with operating our distribution facility and freight  including moving merchandise from our distribution center to stores  and other corporate related expenses 
valuation of inventory 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using a weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
the company s valuation of inventory includes a markdown reserve for merchandise that will be sold below cost and a shrink reserve 
the markdown reserve value is based upon historical information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the shrink reserve value is based on historical information and assumptions as to current shrink trends 
it is possible that changes to the markdown and shrink reserves could be required in future periods due to changes in market conditions 
vendor allowances 
the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendors participation in the reduction of the selling price of merchandise fluctuates based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program 
see note significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flows to the asset carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the leased space for buildout 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
these assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition  management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdictions and to consider this when making its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
a one percent change in the company s overall statutory tax rate for would not have a material effect in the carrying value of the net deferred tax liability 
the company has operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals of tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
actual results could vary from these estimates
