item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services in the home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment areas 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical and administrative support services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home throughout the united states through approximately branch locations 
strategy 
key elements of apria s strategy are as follows place principal focus on growth in its core businesses of home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment 
offering all three service lines gives apria a competitive advantage with its managed care  hospital and physician customers  enabling it to maintain a diversified revenue base 
through specific growth initiatives that enhance the company s clinical offering  apria continues its emphasis on growth in the home respiratory therapy line  which historically has produced higher gross margins than its home infusion therapy and home medical equipment service lines 
supplement internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
apria operates in a highly fragmented market  which provides an opportunity to drive growth through acquisition of complementary businesses 
develop and apply best practices and productivity improvement programs throughout the company with the aim of achieving greater standardization and enhanced productivity 
success with such programs results in reduced costs and increased margins and cash flows 
apria has developed and implemented standardized clinical and delivery models  billing and collection practices  purchasing processes and common operating procedures 
apria continues to focus resources on identifying opportunities for further productivity improvements 
evaluate opportunities to expand offerings in home healthcare 
apria believes that with the aging of the us population  the resulting increases in medical costs and utilization of healthcare services will lead to an expansion of the number of services provided in the home 
providing such services in the home should reduce patient costs as well as enhance patient convenience 
technological advances are also expected to contribute to additional expansion of the domestic home healthcare market 
apria will continue to evaluate new business opportunities 
the focus is on identifying the unfulfilled healthcare needs of apria s existing patient population and evaluating the potential business opportunity associated with each 
management expects that these opportunities  upon determining their viability and scalability  will result in the future expansion of services that apria will offer in the home 
critical accounting policies 
apria s management considers the accounting policies that govern revenue recognition and the determination of the net realizable value of accounts receivable to be the most critical in relation to the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies require the most complex and subjective judgments of management 
additionally  the accounting policies related to goodwill  long lived assets and income taxes require significant judgment 
revenue and accounts receivable 
revenues are recognized on the date services and related products are provided to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received  although services were provided and revenue was earned 
upon determination that an account is uncollectible  it is written off and charged to the allowance 
management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure that recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
management applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable aging to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age  accounts aged in excess of days are reserved at 
management establishes and monitors these percentages through analyses of historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends  the extent of contracted business and business combinations 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures and system changes 
if indicated by such analyses  management may periodically adjust the uncollectible estimate and corresponding percentages 
further  focused reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed to determine if their respective reserve levels are appropriate 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
also  management tests for impairment of its intangible assets and long lived assets on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
apria s goodwill impairment test is conducted at a reporting unit level and compares each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the company has determined that its geographic regions are reporting units under sfas no 
the measurement of fair value for each region is based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows and is further tested using a multiple of earnings approach 
in projecting its reporting units cash flows  management considers industry growth rates and trends  known and potential reimbursement reductions  cost structure changes and local circumstances specific to a region 
based on its tests and reviews  no impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets existed at december  however  future events or changes in current circumstances could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets 
should an asset be deemed impaired  an impairment loss would be recognized  to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated fair market value 
income taxes 
apria provides for income taxes in accordance with provisions specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future  based on tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
in making an assessment regarding the probability of realizing a benefit from these deductible differences  management considers the company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  tax planning strategies and the length of carryforward periods 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
further  the company provides for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and local tax authorities 
segment reporting 
apria s branch locations are organized into geographic regions 
each region consists of a number of branches and a regional office that provides key support services such as billing  purchasing  equipment maintenance  repair and warehousing 
management evaluates operating results on a geographic basis and  therefore  views each region as an operating segment 
all regions provide the same products and services  including respiratory therapy  infusion therapy and home medical equipment and supplies 
additional support services are provided at a corporate level and management continues to evaluate opportunities to gain efficiencies and cost savings by consolidating regional functions 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
change in accounting principle 
effective january   apria adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and amended other guidance related to the accounting and reporting of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
discontinued operations are to be measured similarly to other long lived assets classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
future operating losses will no longer be recognized before they occur 
sfas no 
also broadened the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity when operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  and established criteria to determine when a long lived asset is held for sale 
adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on apria s consolidated financial statements

this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition and guidance for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has complied with the expanded financial statement disclosure requirements in its consolidated financial statements 
see sfas no 
r 
in october  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  which addresses issues raised in the interpretation of sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and the identification and valuation of intangible assets 
eitf provides guidance on determining when  as a result of a business combination  a customer related intangible asset exists that should be separately valued from goodwill 
eitf is effective for business combinations consummated and goodwill impairment tests performed after october  adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas nos 
 and and rescission of fin no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosure requirements for the interim and annual financial statements of the guarantor 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize a liability at the inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
apria was required to adopt the recognition provisions of fin no 
beginning january   while the disclosure provisions became effective at december  adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 was originally issued in january and subsequently revised in december fin no 
 as revised  requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin no 
also requires certain disclosures about variable interest entities in which a company has a significant interest  regardless of whether consolidation is required 
application of fin no 
is required for potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application of the provisions is required for all other variable interest entities by the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  the company currently is not a beneficiary of any variable interest entities  therefore the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

 inventory costs  which amends and clarifies previous guidance on the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage 
abnormal amounts of these costs should be recognized as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities  which refers to a range of production levels within which ordinary variations are expected 
the statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  apria does not expect the adoption of sfas no

the cost will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
adoption of sfas no 
r is required as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  apria will adopt the statement at the beginning of its third quarter in fiscal  on july  management is currently evaluating the statement and its transition provisions 
the impact of adoption on the results of operations cannot be estimated at this time as it is dependent on the level of future share based awards 
however  had sfas no

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
if the future cash flows of the entity are not expected to change significantly as a result of the transaction  then the exchange shall be measured based on the recorded amount of the nonmonetary assets relinquished  rather than on the fair values of the exchanged assets 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning after june  apria does not expect the adoption of sfas no

results of operations net revenues 
net revenues were  million in  up from  million in and  million in growth rates were and in and  respectively 
the revenue growth  net of reductions explained below  resulted from volume increases and the acquisition of complementary businesses 
apria s acquisition strategy generally results in the rapid integration of acquired businesses into existing operating locations 
this rapid integration limits apria s ability to separately track the amount of revenue generated by an acquired business 
estimating the net revenue contribution from acquisitions therefore requires certain assumptions 
based on these assumptions and its analysis  apria estimates that approximately million of the net revenue growth in was derived from acquisitions 
revenue growth in was negatively affected by the medicare reimbursement reduction for respiratory medications that went into effect january  also  revenues declined as apria transitioned out of the gentiva carecentrix inc contract which management chose not to renew for due to contract pricing differences 
the effect in of the medicare reduction was million and the reduction to revenues resulting from the gentiva transition was million 
further  apria is experiencing increased pricing pressure from its managed care customers as these organizations seek to lower costs by obtaining more favorable pricing from providers such as apria 
managed care organizations are also evaluating alternative delivery models for certain products and services  which include those provided by apria 
this potential change may cause apria to provide reduced levels of certain products and services in the future  resulting in a corresponding reduction in revenue 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in thousands home respiratory therapy    home infusion therapy    home medical equipment other    total net revenues    respiratory therapy 
respiratory therapy revenues are derived primarily from the provision of oxygen systems  home ventilators  sleep apnea equipment  nebulizers  respiratory medications and related services 
revenues from the respiratory therapy service line increased in by when compared to and increased by in when compared to this growth was primarily driven by volume increases and acquisitions of respiratory therapy businesses 
the medicare reimbursement reduction for respiratory medications caused a decline of in the revenue growth rates for the growth in this service line was also reduced by the non renewal of the gentiva contract  the related decline represented of prior year respiratory revenues 
infusion therapy 
the infusion therapy service line involves the administration of a drug or nutrient directly into the body intravenously through a needle or catheter 
infusion therapy services also include administering enteral nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract through a feeding tube 
infusion therapy revenues increased in versus and in versus growth in enteral nutrition  one of the strongest contributors in the infusion line was impacted by the gentiva contract exit 
the decline in gentiva infusion revenues in  virtually all of which had been derived from enteral nutrition  represented of prior year infusion revenues 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues are derived from the provision of equipment to assist patients with ambulation  safety and general care in and around the home 
home medical equipment other revenues increased by in from and by in from rehabilitation revenue growth in has been considerably lower than in  largely as a result of action taken by the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  that required previously qualified orders for power mobility devices to be re screened against stricter qualification standards 
this process resulted in the delay and cancellation of many orders in the first half of  particularly in the first quarter 
in the past  the rehabilitation product business was a strong contributor to the growth in the home medical equipment other line 
further  the decline in gentiva revenues in home medical equipment other represented of prior year home medical equipment other revenues 
diabetic supplies  historically a very small percentage of the home medical equipment line  grew significantly in this growth is directly attributable to an acquisition early in the year of a company that entered the diabetic supply market just prior to being acquired 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
in  approximately of apria s revenues were reimbursed under arrangements with medicare and medicaid 
no other third party payor represents or more of the company s revenues 
the majority of the company s revenues are derived from fees charged for patient care under fee for service arrangements 
revenues derived from capitation arrangements represent less than of total net revenues for all periods presented 
medicare reimbursement 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which is herein referred to as the medicare modernization act  became law 
the medicare modernization act includes a number of provisions that affect medicare part b reimbursement policies for items and services provided by apria  the most significant of which are reimbursement reductions for five durable medical equipment categories  including oxygen reimbursement for most of these categories is based on the median price paid for such items on behalf of beneficiaries of federal employee health benefit plans  or fehbp 
the new fee schedules went into effect january  the reimbursement reduction for oxygen  however  is delayed until the office of the inspector general provides the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  with the additional data required to establish pricing 
providers are currently being reimbursed for oxygen based on fee schedules  with an indication from cms that no retroactive adjustment will be made once the new pricing is in effect 
further  a freeze on annual payment increases for durable medical equipment has been instituted from through reimbursement reduction for inhalation drugs the previous reimbursement rate of of the average wholesale price was reduced to of the average wholesale price  effective january  beginning in january  reimbursement for these drugs was further reduced through a shift to the manufacturer reported average sales price  as defined by the medicare modernization act  plus  plus a separate dispensing fee per patient episode 
the dispensing fees for have been established at for a day supply of medications and for a day supply 
establishment of a competitive bidding program such a program would require that suppliers wishing to provide certain items to beneficiaries submit bids to medicare 
the program  for as yet unspecified durable medical equipment items and services  is to be transitioned into i of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in  ii of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in  and iii additional areas after the legislation contains special provisions for rural areas 
reimbursement for home infusion therapy under medicare part d currently  a limited number of infusion therapies  supplies and equipment is covered by medicare part b 
the medicare modernization act provides expanded coverage for home infusion drugs 
the industry is currently working with cms to further define the coverage and payment policies that will govern the administration of this benefit  which takes effect in incentives for expansion of medicare part c the medicare modernization act includes financial incentives for managed care plans to expand their provision of medicare advantage plans in in a stated effort to attract more medicare beneficiaries to managed care models 
the company maintains contracts to provide respiratory  infusion and medical equipment and related services to a significant number of managed care plans nationwide  and believes that the medicare advantage expansion represents a growth opportunity starting in mid apria s management estimates that the revision to inhalation drug reimbursement in resulted in a revenue reduction from levels of approximately million 
once the oxygen fee schedules are released  management will provide an estimate of the aggregate impact of all reimbursement reductions that will be in effect for the impact of the competitive bidding program scheduled to commence in cannot be estimated at this time 
the balanced budget act of contained several provisions that lowered apria s medicare reimbursement levels 
subsequent legislation the medicare balanced budget refinement act of and the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of mitigated some of the effects of the original legislation 
the medicare modernization act also addressed some of the issues pending from the earlier legislation 
however  still pending from the legislation is the streamlined authority granted to the secretary of the us department of health and human services  or hhs  to increase or reduce the reimbursement for home medical equipment  including oxygen  by up to each year under an inherent reasonableness authority 
in december  cms issued an interim final rule that establishes a process by which such adjustments may be made 
the rule applies to all medicare part b services except those paid under a physician fee schedule  a prospective payment system  or a competitive bidding program 
as of this date  neither cms nor the durable medical equipment regional carriers have used the expedited authority 
medicaid reimbursement 
since  some states have adopted alternative pricing methodologies for certain drugs and biologicals under the medicaid program 
in at least states  these changes have reduced the level of reimbursement received by apria without a corresponding offset or increase to compensate for the service costs incurred 
in several of those states  apria has elected to stop accepting new medicaid patient referrals for the affected drugs 
apria is continuing to provide services to patients already on service  and for those who receive other medicaid covered respiratory  home medical equipment or infusion therapies  if the reimbursement levels for those services remain adequate 
further  some states are considering other reductions in medicaid reimbursement as they work through their respective state s budget process 
apria management cannot predict the outcome of such budget negotiations and whether other states will consider reductions as well 
gross profit 
gross margins were in  in and in the margin declined by due to the medicare reimbursement reductions for respiratory medications and was further impacted by the non renewal of the gentiva contract 
also  as noted above  apria s revenue line has been adversely affected by pricing pressures from its managed care partners 
however  apria has been successful in negotiating favorable product pricing with the company s suppliers  thereby minimizing the impact of the revenue pricing pressures on the gross margin 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimate of the net realizable value of accounts receivable after considering actual write offs of specific receivables 
accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible are provided for by applying specific percentages to each receivables aging category  which is determined by the number of days the receivable is outstanding 
for  and  the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and  respectively 
the improvement in when compared to is partially due to strong cash collections in late and a focused effort to increase cash applications 
also impacting the provision was a lower allowance requirement indicated by the company s analysis of subsequent realization data 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses incurred in direct support of operations and those associated with administrative functions 
expenses incurred by the operating locations include salaries and other expenses in the following functional areas selling  distribution  clinical  intake  reimbursement  warehousing and repair 
many of these operating costs are directly variable with revenue growth patterns 
some are also very sensitive to market driven price fluctuations such as facility lease and fuel costs 
the administrative expenses include overhead costs incurred by the operating locations and corporate support functions 
these expenses do not vary as closely with revenue growth as do the operating costs 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses  expressed as percentages of net revenues  were in  in and in the effect of the medicare reimbursement reduction on this percentage in was an increase of 
expenses in reflect savings resulting from management s focus on productivity and controls placed on labor expenses beginning late in the third quarter of management is currently implementing additional productivity initiatives aimed at further reducing costs to mitigate the effects of the medicare reimbursement reductions 
the decrease in when compared to is largely due to one time costs charged in that included executive termination costs and professional fees associated with the favorable outcome and settlement of an income tax dispute 
see income tax expense 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in  million in and million in the increase in amortization of intangible assets in is largely due to increased acquisition activity and the valuation of certain customer relationships acquired in the business combinations 
the increase in  when compared to  is also due to a higher level of acquisition activity 
interest expense and income and write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest income was   and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense was higher in due to the impact of a full year of interest on the million convertible senior notes versus five months recorded in the interest increases were partially offset by interest reductions resulting from a decrease in borrowings under the credit agreement due to scheduled principal amortization payments and by the expiration in march of two interest rate swap agreements that had fixed interest at higher rates on a portion of apria s debt 
interest expense increased in from due to the issuance of the convertible senior notes in august the additional interest was offset by lower interest on the bank loans due to a reduction in the principal balance and the full year s effect of the lower applicable interest margin on the million term loan resulting from a june amendment to the credit agreement 
interest income in reflects a million interest refund received in conjunction with the favorable outcome of an income tax dispute 
further  in  the company wrote off million in unamortized debt issuance costs in conjunction with the november refinancing of the company s bank loans 
see long term debt 
income tax expense 
income taxes were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and were provided at the effective tax rates expected to be applicable for each year 
the income tax provision for was reduced by a benefit of million that resulted from the favorable outcome of an income tax dispute which was settled in the fourth quarter of as a result of settling the tax dispute  apria utilized approximately million of its previously limited million net operating loss carryforward during such net operating loss carryforward was generated prior to and utilization had been limited to million per year in accordance with internal revenue code section prior to  the million net operating loss carryforward was not recognized for financial statement reporting purposes as management believed it was unlikely that they would be used before expiration 
the remaining net operating loss carryforward of approximately million was excluded from the related deferred tax assets and has expired unused 
apria utilized million of federal net operating loss carryforwards in the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of million expired unused on december  the company utilized its remaining alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of million in additionally  the company has various apportioned state net operating loss carryforwards of million  net of federal tax benefit  as of december  the company believes it has adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and local tax authorities 
at december   million  net of tax benefit  was accrued for such federal  state and local tax matters 
although not probable  the most adverse resolution of these federal  state and local issues could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods in addition to the million currently provided 
based upon a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will have a materially adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources apria s principal source of liquidity is its operating cash flow  which is supplemented by a million revolving credit facility 
apria s ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of its operating needs has afforded it the ability  among other things  to pursue its acquisition strategy and fund patient service equipment purchases to support revenue growth  while continuing to reduce long term debt 
apria s management believes that its operating cash flow and revolving credit line will continue to be sufficient to fund its operations and growth strategies 
however  sustaining the current cash flow levels is dependent on many factors  some of which are not within apria s control  such as government reimbursement levels and the financial health of its payors 
cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the increase in  when compared to  is largely due to an increase in net income before items not requiring cash and the timing of disbursements processed against accounts payable and other accruals 
these items were partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable in than in  which resulted from acquisition activity 
operating cash flow was relatively flat between and despite the fact that reflects income tax payments totaling million as compared to income tax refunds of million in cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to increased acquisition activity 
cash used in investing activities increased in when compared to due to higher levels of acquisition activity and patient service equipment expenditures 
in  cash used by financing activities was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in  and cash used in financing activities of million in cash used in primarily relates to the million repurchase of the company s common stock and the scheduled principal payments made against the term loans prior to the november refinancing 
cash provided in reflects the net proceeds received upon issuance of million of convertible senior notes 
also  the company repurchased a total of million of its common stock in  million of which was purchased with the convertible note proceeds 
contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes apria s long term cash payment obligations to which the company is contractually bound for the year ending december  in millions total revolving loan convertible senior notes capital lease obligations other long term debt operating leases deferred acquisition payments total contractual cash obligations accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million during  which is primarily attributable to the revenue increase  particularly from acquisitions 
days sales outstanding calculated as of each period end by dividing accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  by the day rolling average of net revenues were days at december  compared to at december  the increase in days sales outstanding from the end of to the end of is primarily due to the acquisition activity in the time consuming processes of converting patient files onto apria s systems and obtaining provider numbers from governmental payors routinely delay billing of the newly acquired business 
consequently  the related cash receipts are delayed  causing a temporary increase in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding 
accounts aged in excess of days were of total receivables at december  and at the end of at december   accounts aged in excess of days for certain summary payor categories were as follows medicare  medicaid  self pay and managed care other 
unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
delays  ranging from a day up to several weeks  between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
the higher unbilled amount at december  is largely due to acquisitions effected during  for the reasons noted above 
inventories and patient service equipment 
inventories consist primarily of pharmaceuticals and disposable products used in conjunction with patient service equipment 
patient service equipment consists of respiratory and home medical equipment that is provided to in home patients for the course of their care plan  normally on a rental basis  and subsequently returned to apria for redistribution after cleaning and maintenance is performed 
the branch locations serve as the primary point from which inventories and patient service equipment are delivered to the patient 
the branches are supplied with inventory and equipment from the regional warehouses  which coordinate purchasing with the corporate office 
the regions are also responsible for repairs and scheduled maintenance of patient service equipment  which adds to the frequent movement of equipment between the region and branch locations 
further  the majority of apria s patient service equipment is located in patients homes 
while the utilization varies widely between equipment types  on the average  approximately of the equipment is on rent at any given time 
inherent in this asset flow is the fact that losses will occur 
management has successfully instituted a number of controls over the company s inventories and patient service equipment to minimize such losses 
depending on the product type  the company performs physical inventories on an annual or quarterly basis 
inventory and patient service equipment balances in the financial records are adjusted to reflect the results of these physical inventories 
inventory and patient service equipment losses for  and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that apria will be able to maintain its current level of control over inventories and patient service equipment 
continued revenue growth is directly dependent on apria s ability to fund its inventory and patient service equipment requirements 
long term debt 
apria s credit agreement with bank of america and a syndicate of lenders was amended and restated effective november  the amendment increased the limit of the company s senior secured credit agreement to million from million 
prior to the amendment  the credit facilities consisted of a million revolving credit facility  a million five year term loan and a million seven year term loan 
these loans were eliminated in favor of a million revolving credit facility  from which proceeds were used to pay off the remaining balances on the previous loans 
the maturity date of the new revolver is november  the senior secured credit agreement permits apria to select one of two variable interest rates 
one option is the base rate  which is expressed as the higher of a the federal funds rate plus or b the bank of america prime rate 
the other option is the eurodollar rate  which is based on the london interbank offered rate 
interest on outstanding balances under the senior secured credit agreement is determined by adding a margin to the eurodollar rate or base rate in effect at each interest calculation date 
the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility is based on apria s debt rating as determined by s p or moody s with respect to the credit facility 
the applicable margin ranges from to for eurodollar loans and from zero to for base rate loans 
the effective interest rate at december   after consideration of the effect of the swap agreements described below  was 
the senior credit agreement also requires payment of commitment fees ranging from to also based on apria s debt rating on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
see hedging activities 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of apria 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by the credit agreement 
on december  outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility were million 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million and credit available under the revolving facility was million 
convertible senior notes 
in august  apria issued convertible senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million under an indenture between apria and us bank national association 
the notes were issued in a private placement at an issue price of  per note of the principal amount at maturity and were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission

hedging activities 
apria is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its underlying variable rate long term debt 
apria s policy for managing interest rate risk is to evaluate and monitor all available relevant information  including but not limited to  the structure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities  historical interest rate trends and interest rate forecasts published by major financial institutions 
the tools apria may utilize to moderate its exposure to fluctuations in the relevant interest rate indices include  but are not limited to strategic determination of repricing periods and related principal amounts  and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements  caps or collars 
apria does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes

federal investigation 
as previously reported  since mid apria has been the subject of an investigation conducted by the us attorney s office in los angeles and the us department of health and human services 
the investigation concerns the documentation supporting apria s billing for services provided to patients whose healthcare costs are paid by medicare and other federal programs 
apria is cooperating with the government and has responded to various document requests and subpoenas 
the investigation relates to two civil qui tam lawsuits against apria filed under seal on behalf of the government 
in the government for the first time provided apria with redacted copies of the complaints in these lawsuits 
on the copies provided to apria  the names of the plaintiffs  the courts and the dates instituted were blacked out 
in general  both complaints allege that for an unspecified period of time commencing in apria knowingly engaged in various schemes to defraud the government by submitting false claims for payment and by manipulating and falsifying documentation in support of such claims 
the complaints do not quantify the alleged damages sought and do not identify any of the particular individuals  patient accounts or apria facilities alleged to be involved in any improper billing 
to date  the us attorney s office has not informed apria of any decision to intervene in the qui tam actions  however  it could reach a decision with respect to intervention at any time 
apria has acknowledged that there may be errors and omissions in supporting documentation affecting a portion of its billings 
however  it believes that most of the alleged documentation errors and omissions should not give rise to any liability 
accordingly  apria believes that most of the assertions made by the government and the qui tam plaintiffs are legally and factually incorrect and that apria is in a position to assert numerous meritorious defenses 
during the past several years  apria and representatives of the government have been analyzing and discussing the documentation underlying apria s billings to the federal government for services provided by apria from mid through to a sample of patients selected by the government 
government representatives and counsel for the plaintiffs asserted in that  by a process of extrapolation from the patient files in the sample to all of apria s government billings during the sample period  apria could have a very significant liability to the government under the false claims act 
differences between apria and the government have been reduced on a number of issues as a result of the analysis and discussions referred to above 
consequently  while apria s potential liability could still be very material  apria believes that the amount the government is now seeking is significantly less than asserted in apria and government representatives are continuing to explore whether it will be possible to resolve this matter on a basis that would be considered fair and reasonable by all parties 
notwithstanding the progress made to date in reducing the differences between apria and the government  there remain significant disagreements as to the number and the legal implications of billing documentation deficiencies in the patient sample 
accordingly  apria cannot provide any assurances as to the outcome of its discussions with the government  or as to the outcome of the qui tam litigation in the absence of a settlement 
management cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from these proceedings and  therefore  has not recorded any related accruals 
if a judge  jury or administrative agency were to determine that false claims were submitted to federal healthcare programs or that there were significant overpayments by the government  apria could face civil and administrative claims for refunds  sanctions and penalties for amounts that would be highly material to its business  results of operations and financial condition  including the exclusion of apria from participation in federal healthcare programs 
off balance sheet arrangements apria is not a party to off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
however  from time to time the company enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the company to indemnify parties against third party claims 
the contracts primarily relate to i certain asset purchase agreements  under which the company may provide customary indemnification to the seller of the business being acquired  ii certain real estate leases  under which the company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities  and other claims arising from the company s use of the applicable premises  and iii certain agreements with the company s officers  directors and employees  under which the company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship 
the terms of such obligations vary by contract and in most instances a specific or maximum dollar amount is not explicitly stated therein 
generally  amounts under these contracts cannot be reasonably estimated until a specific claim is asserted 
consequently  no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the company s balance sheets for any of the periods presented

apria utilizes interest rate swap agreements to moderate such exposure 
apria does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   apria s revolving credit facility borrowings totaled million 
the bank credit agreement governing the revolver provides interest rate options based on the following indices federal funds rate  the bank of america prime rate or the london interbank offered rate 
all such interest rate options are subject to the application of an interest margin as specified in the bank credit agreement 
at december   all of apria s outstanding revolving debt was tied to libor 
at december   apria had a three year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of and a four year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of 
both rates are before the application of the interest margin 
based on the term debt outstanding and the swap agreements in place at december   a basis point change in the applicable interest rates would increase or decrease apria s annual cash flow and pretax earnings by approximately million
