item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview the company develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products 
it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands  including arm hammer and trojan  to consumers through supermarkets  drug stores and mass merchandisers  and to industrial customers and distributors 
on may   the company acquired the joint venture interest in armkel owned by affiliates of kelso company  and armkel was merged into the company 
this is sometimes referred as the armkel acquisition 
the discussion of results of operations of armkel are reflected in the results of operations since the acquisition on may  the company is divided into three primary segments  consumer domestic  consumer international and specialty products 
our consumer domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing and cleaning  such as arm hammer baking soda  cat litter  scrub free  brillo cleaning products and laundry products  such as xtra and arm hammer laundry detergents  and personal care products  such as trojan condoms  nair depilatories and waxes  first response and answer home pregnancy and ovulation test kits  arrid antiperspirant and arm hammer  mentadent  close up  pepsodent and aim toothpastes 
our consumer international segment sells a variety of personal care products  some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines  in international markets  including france  the united kingdom  canada  mexico  australia and spain 
our specialty products segment is the largest us producer of sodium bicarbonate  which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial  institutional  medical and food applications 
this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products 
for the twelve months ended december   our consumer domestic  consumer international and specialty products segments spd represented approximately  and  respectively  of net sales 
for the two year period ended december   the company s earnings per share has grown at an average rate of approximately  its sales has increased from  million in to  million in and its gross profit margin increased from in to in the major reasons for these increases stem from the unilever oral care business and armkel acquisitions 
the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets  in which cost efficiency  new product offerings and innovation are critical to success 
the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration  particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care 
furthermore  because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers  the company faces pricing pressure from these customers  particularly the high volume retail store customers  who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
to protect our existing market share or to capture increased market share  the company has had to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products 
consequently  the need for on going cost cutting initiatives needs to be sustained as new product introductions or product line extensions remain the most viable path to generating organic top line growth given the mature nature of most product categories in north american markets 
through its recent acquisitions  the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities 
this has resulted in higher levels of cash flow 
in the specialty products segment  competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines remained intense in and specialty chemicals operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization  buyers leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs 
with respect to the animal nutrition product line  the company continues to face higher ingredient costs for its line of nutritional supplements under the megalac brand name  and weathered a poor us dairy economy in  which had a severe impact on the purchasing ability and financial viability of dairymen 
to meet these challenges  the specialty products business pursued an important business improvement initiative which was aimed at improving its longer term operational effectiveness and cost structure 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include promotional and sales returns reserves the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers such as coupons and sales incentives made to vendors such as slotting  cooperative advertising  incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements 
all such costs are netted against sales 
slotting costs are recorded when the related sale is recognized 
co op advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company s products 
discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place 
costs associated with end aisle or other in store displays are recorded when product is sold relating to the promotion 
the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves 
for example  the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates 
table of contents to determine reserve requirements 
based on the total face value of coupons redeemed over the past couple of years  a deviation in the actual rate of redemptions versus the rate accrued for in the financial statements could result in approximately a million difference in the reserve required 
with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns  we use experience based estimates  customer and sales organization inputs  and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required 
if the company s estimates for vendor promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by  the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately million 
while we believe that our promotional and sales returns reserves are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
during the twelve months ended december   the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately million based on changes to previous estimates  and in and the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions 
with respect to goodwill  impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit 
for trademarks and other intangible assets  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology  the continued success of product lines  and future volume  revenue and expense growth rates 
the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment  and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows 
when an impairment is indicated  the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken 
future outcomes may also differ 
if the company s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized  then the company s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 
in  the company recognized tradename impairment  plant impairment and equipment obsolescence charges of approximately million  which was included in the operating results of the consumer domestic segment 
in the company recognized an impairment charge of million on manufacturing equipment which was charged to the consumer domestic segment 
in  the company recognized tradename  equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately million  which was charged to the consumer domestic segment 
inventory valuation when appropriate  the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the company identifies any slow moving  obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company s products  technological changes  and new product introductions 
the estimates as to the future demand used in the valuation of inventory are dependent on the ongoing success of the company s products 
in addition  the company s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the rationalization of the number of stock keeping units sku s 
the number of sku s has been reduced by approximately over the last years 
to minimize this risk  the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required 
adjustments to the inventory s net realizable value were million at december   and million at december  valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to our actuaries  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in applicable high quality  long term corporate bond indices 
based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as the moody s aa corporate bond index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
based on the published rates as of december   as well as selected corporate bonds matching our estimated cash flows of the plans  the company used a discount rate of for the three remaining domestic plans  a decline of basis points from the rate used in this had the effect of increasing the projected benefit obligation for pensions and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  
table of contents the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend based on a year average  the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans  the asset mix of the plans  and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
based on these factors  the company s weighted average expected long term rate of return as of december  is  a decline of basis points from the rate used at december  this decrease is due to the change in the expected long term rate of the company s domestic plans from to and the inclusion of armkel s plans 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return would result in less than a million change in pension expense for on december  the accumulated benefit obligation related to our pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets such excess is referred to as an un funded accumulated benefit obligation 
this difference is attributed to an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation that resulted from the decrease in the interest rate used to discount the projected benefit obligation to its present settlement amount from to  partially offset by the increase in the market value of the plan assets at december  as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of million included in benefit obligations  and recorded a charge  net of tax  to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million which decreased stockholders equity 
the charge to stockholders equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense 
based on the aforementioned assumptions  the income statement impact for is estimated to be approximately million charged to earnings 
on a cash basis  an estimated contribution of approximately million will be required in tax contingencies the company records liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions 
the liabilities relate to tax return positions  although supportable by the company  that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
the company adjusts these liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation  interpretations of laws by courts  rulings by tax authorities  changes in estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations 
the company s tax rate includes the impact of the liabilities and any changes to the liabilities 
settlement of any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash 
favorable resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to the company s annual tax rate

net sales of liquid laundry detergent were significantly higher and more than offset the continuing industry trend of declining powder laundry detergent sales as an increasing number of consumers switched to the liquid form of the product in the laundry products line 
personal care products  exclusive of the impact of the oral care business acquisition  were lower in part because of a reduction in gum sales and the discontinued arm hammer breathcare line 
consumer domestic income before taxes and minority interest increased million  or  to million mostly due to a million increase in gross profit with more than half of this increase attributable to the acquired oral care brands

competitive environment many of our competitors are large companies  including the procter gamble company  unilever  inc  the clorox company  colgate palmolive company  the gillette company  sc johnson son  inc  pfizer  inverness and ssl international  which have greater financial resources than the company 
these companies have the capacity to outspend the company in an attempt to gain market share 
because of the competitive environment facing retailers  the company faces pricing pressure from these customers  particularly the high volume retail store customers  who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
these concessions or terms could reduce the company s margins 
furthermore  if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers  the customers could increase product purchases from our competitors  which would harm the company s sales and profitability 
consumer products  particularly those that are value priced  such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition 
from time to time  the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 
the company has entered the oral care and personal care and deodorizing businesses using the unique strengths of its arm hammer trademark and baking soda technology 
these are highly innovative markets  characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions  and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 
in the toothpaste category  after leading its category in growth several years ago  driven by the success of arm hammer advance white toothpaste  the company s share dropped in both and mainly as a result of competitive new products and aggressive spending by other manufacturers in the category 
however in  share increased modestly based upon the introduction of arm hammer enamel care 
early in  the company launched arm hammer enamel care toothpaste  its most important oral care innovation in several years 
enamel care is based on proprietary formulation and packaging technology which combines the cleaning and whitening properties of baking soda with fluoride and patented liquid calcium in a dual chamber tube to fill tooth surfaces and restore enamel luster 
the product is available in two variants advanced cleaning and natural whitening 
in  the company will introduce arm hammer enamel care with breath defense  which combines liquid calcium technology with additional long lasting breath benefits 
in addition  the entire arm hammer toothpaste line has been re staged with new packaging graphics designed to return the brand to its original emphasis on therapeutic benefits 
in  the company is launching mentadent replenishing white toothpaste with liquid calcium technology to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent stains from forming 
other important personal care initiatives  early in  included additions to the arm hammer ultramax antiperspirant line and in  the entire arrid antiperspirant line will be restaged with improved formulas  fragrances and packaging 
the domestic condom market is highly concentrated in product offerings with a limited number of competitors 
the market is divided between premium brands and price brands  with companies competing on the basis of quality  innovation and price 
the major domestic producers are the company  with its trojan  naturalamb and class act brands  ssl international with its durex and avanti brands  and ansell with its lifestyles brand

the receivables assets and the short term borrowings of harrison are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the transactions were entered into to reduce certain expenses associated with the credit facility in addition to lowering the company s financing costs by accessing the commercial paper market 
during july  as a result of purchasing kelso s interest in armkel  the company amended its accounts receivable securitization agreement to increase the capacity that can be borrowed from million to the current million 
the balance outstanding under the agreement on december  was million 
the proceeds of the increased borrowing were used to make a voluntary term a loan payment on august  in august of  the company issued million principal amount of convertible senior debentures due august  through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers 
the debentures rank equal in right of payment with all of the company s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness

holders may convert their debentures into shares of the company s common stock prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per each  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
a holder may convert the debentures into the company s common stock under the following circumstances during any conversion period prior to august   if the sale price of the company s common stock is more than of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the first day of that conversion period the conversion price premium  the trading price of a debenture falls below a specified threshold  specified credit rating events with respect to the debentures occur  the company calls the debentures for redemption  or specified corporate transactions occur 
because of the inclusion of the restricted convertibility feature of the debentures  the company s diluted net income per common share calculation effective for periods ending before december  did not account for the effect to the dilution from the conversion of the debentures until the company s share price exceeded the conversion price premium or one of the other events described above occurs 
however  the emerging issues task force eitf concluded in eitf issue  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  that contingently convertible debt co cos be treated for diluted earnings per share purposes as if converted from debt to equity  beginning with the date the contingently convertible debt instrument is initially issued  even if the triggering events such as stock price have not yet occurred  and prior period eps amounts presented for comparative purposes would have to be restated 
the company has implemented this consensus in its financial statements  which had the effect of lowering diluted earnings per share by and did not have an effect on and earnings per share 
in conjunction with the armkel acquisition  the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with several banks and other financial institutions  the bank of nova scotia  fleet national bank and national city bank  each as a documentation agent  citicorp north america  inc  as syndication agent  and jp morgan chase bank  as administrative agent

the revolving loans are available for general corporate purposes 
the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries 
those domestic subsidiaries have also guaranteed the loan obligations under the credit agreement 
the term loans and the revolving loans bear interest under one of two rate options  selected by the company  equal to a either i a eurocurrency rate adjusted for any reserve requirements eurocurrency rate or ii the greater of the 
table of contents prime rate  the secondary market rate for three month certificates of deposit adjusted for any reserve requirements plus the applicable fdic assessment rate plus  or the federal funds effective rate plus alternate base rate  plus b an applicable margin

during the fourth quarter of  the company issued million of senior subordinated notes due december  through a private placement 
in conjunction with the placement  the company effected a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the outstanding armkel senior subordinated notes due that it assumed as part of the acquisition 
it was determined that the price to be paid for each  principal amount of notes tendered and accepted for payment including a consent payment of per  principal amount of notes was  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date

the terms of the subordinated note and credit agreement place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments the company can make 
this limitation includes the amount the company can pay in dividends on its common stock 
as long as the company is not in default under either agreement  the limitation which is a percentage of net income relative to the company s consolidated leverage ratio is such that the company does not currently anticipate having an effect on its ability to pay dividends at its current rate

adjusted ebitda is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the company s primary credit facility and senior subordinated notes 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the company s ability to service its indebtedness 
adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities  which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
financial covenants include a total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  which  if not met  could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility and notes  if not remedied within a certain period of time 
the definition of adjusted ebitda in the notes are not materially different than that of the credit agreement 
adjusted ebitda was approximately million for the leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda for the twelve months december  which  under the credit agreement  permitted the inclusion of armkel s ebitda prior to its acquisition by the company for pro forma purposes  was versus the agreement s maximum  and the interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to total interest expense was versus the agreement s minimum of this credit agreement is secured by the assets of the company and certain domestic subsidiaries 
the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda is as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities interest expense current income tax provision cash portion of loss on early extinguishment of debt distributions from affiliates change in working capital and other liabilities investment income armkel adjusted ebitda for month period ending may  other adjusted ebitda per credit agreement net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities
