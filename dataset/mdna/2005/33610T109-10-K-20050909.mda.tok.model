financial condition general 
assets at june  totaled billion compared to billion at june   an increase of million or 
asset growth was driven by loan growth during the fiscal year 
this growth was primarily funded by deposit growth and to a lesser extent by an increase in borrowings and a decrease in securities 
growth in both loans and deposits resulted from offering an expanded line of products over a wider geographic area resulting from the franklin merger and the expansion of loan production offices to business financial centers in the cleveland  ohio market 
we anticipate that future growth will come from a combination of increasing market share in existing markets  the addition of new retail branches  the conversion of loan production offices to business financial centers and acquisitions 
growth by acquisition will be subject to the availability and pricing of appropriate acquisition partners 
interest bearing deposits in other banks 
the interest bearing deposits in other banks of million as of june  represented overnight deposits of franklin bank 
after franklin bank was merged with first place bank on july  these funds were immediately used to reduce overnight borrowings of first place bank 
the company has been a net borrower of overnight funds during the remainder of the current fiscal year 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale totaled million at june   an increase of million or from million at june  the increase in loans held for sale was due to a higher level of loan closings in june than in june and because a higher proportion of loans closed were originated for sale in june than in june during fiscal  the company sought out and found buyers for loans that were not readily saleable to fannie mae or freddie mac 
this enabled the company to sell a greater proportion of residential mortgage loans originated in fiscal compared with prior years 
management anticipates that it will continue to sell a high proportion of residential loans originated  and expects that loans held for sale will average in excess of million during fiscal 
table of contents loans 
total loans increased million to billion at june  from billion at june  the increase by type of loan included increases of million in one to four family residential real estate loans  million in commercial loans and million in consumer loans 
at june   the loan portfolio was residential real estate loans  commercial loans and consumer loans 
at june   the loan portfolio was residential real estate loans  commercial loans and consumer loans 
the company intends to continue to increase commercial loans relative to residential real estate loans in order to increase the diversity of the loan portfolio 
the company engages in mortgage banking as part of an overall strategy to deliver loan products to customers 
as a result  the company sells most fixed rate residential loans and some adjustable rate residential loans 
during fiscal  the company originated billion in one to four family residential loans and sold billion compared to originations of billion and sales of billion in fiscal this increase was achieved through the addition of a loan production office in jackson  michigan  increases in the volume of activity in loan production offices opened in fiscal and the hiring of additional commissioned loan officers 
nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets consist of loans past due greater than days  nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and repossessed assets 
there were no loans at june  or at june  past due greater than days and still accruing interest 
nonperforming assets totaled million at june   compared with million at june  while nonperforming assets increased million during fiscal  the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to at june   from at june  at june   nonperforming assets consisted of million in nonperforming loans and million in repossessed assets 
at june   nonperforming assets consisted of million in nonperforming loans  and million of repossessed assets 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the performance of the loan portfolio considering economic conditions  changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on real estate values  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  and trends in past due and nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the company s loan portfolio and the general economy 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that management believes warrant recognition in providing for an appropriate loan loss allowance 
in addition to the analysis and procedures just described  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent review of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the company uses the results of this review to help determine the effectiveness of the existing policies and procedures  and to provide an independent assessment of the allowance for loan losses allocated to these types of loans 
loans days or more delinquent totaled million as of june  and million as of june  loans or more days delinquent as a percent of net loans were as june  and as of june  nonperforming loans followed a similar pattern 
nonperforming loans at june  were million at june   an increase of million from million at june  over the same period nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans declined to from 
net charge offs for fiscal totaled million compared with million for the fiscal the change in the allowance was consistent with the changes in delinquencies and nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans also declined to at june   compared with at june  at june   the allowance for loan losses was million  an increase of million or compared with million as of june  securities 
the securities portfolio decreased million to million at june   from million at june  the change in securities included million in payments and maturities  million in sales  million in purchases  million in impairment charges and million in other activity 
see the noninterest income section of the comparison of results of operations for years ended june  and  for further discussion of the impairment charges 
the company intentionally reduced the size of the investment portfolio in order to fund additional growth in new loans 
loans generally carry higher yields than securities and this change in the asset mix to include relatively more loans and less securities had a positive effect on the earning asset yield and net interest income 
further significant reductions in securities are not likely as the company strives to maintain a reasonable level of securities to provide adequate liquidity and in order to have securities available to pledge to secure public funds and other types of transactions 
fluctuations in the market value of securities held by the company relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and management believes  at this time  that all impairment in the securities portfolio is temporary 

table of contents deposits 
total deposits were billion at june   an increase of million  compared to billion at june  the net change by deposit category included a million decrease in noninterest bearing checking  a million increase in interest bearing checking  a million increase in savings accounts  a million decrease in money market accounts and a million increase in certificates of deposit 
the growth in certificates of deposit included million of growth in brokered deposits and million in growth from the retail branch system 
at june  the company had million in brokered deposits with original maturities ranging from nine to forty two months 
the company considers brokered deposits to be an element of a diversified funding strategy and an alternative to borrowings 
management regularly compares rates to determine the most economical source of funding 
the company anticipates that they will continue to use brokered funds as a funding alternative in the future  but not as the primary source of funding to support growth 
borrowings 
borrowings increased million or to million at june  compared with million at june  the growth in borrowings included million in short term borrowings and million in long term borrowings 
the company uses borrowings as part of its liquidity management  cash flow  and asset liability management and considers borrowings to be part of a diversified funding strategy 
borrowings are an alternative to raising cash through deposit growth and are used when they offer a favorable alternative to deposits in terms of rate  maturity or volume 
capital resources 
total shareholders equity increased million to million at june   compared with million at june  this increase was primarily composed of million in comprehensive income reduced by million of cash dividends and million for treasury stock purchases 
stock issued in connection with benefit plans accounted for the remainder of the increase 
the company s board of directors authorized stock repurchase programs in march and march for the repurchase of up to  shares and  shares  respectively  of the company s common stock over a month period in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares at an average price of 
at june   there were  shares remaining under the stock buy back program approved in march stock repurchase programs are a component of the company s strategy to invest excess capital after consideration of market and economic factors  the effect on shareholder dilution  adequacy of capital  effect on liquidity and an assessment of alternative investment returns 
shares repurchased by the company may be used to meet the company s requirements for common shares under its dividend reinvestment plan  stock option or other stock based plans and for general corporate purposes such as expansion and acquisitions or future capital requirements 
office of thrift supervision ots regulations require savings institutions to maintain certain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
additionally  the regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
generally  an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a core tier capital ratio of at least based on adjusted total assets  a core tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at june   the bank s capital levels were above the levels required to be well capitalized 
see the liquidity section of this report for a discussion of dividends as a source of funding for the holding company and dividend restrictions imposed on the bank by the ots 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations 
the company uses a variety of funding sources to finance its earning assets and other activities 
these contractual obligations have various terms and maturities that may require the outlay of cash in the future 
the company also enters into contracts such as lease obligations or purchase obligations that commit the company to make future payments for the acquisition of goods or services needed for the normal conduct of its business 
the following table summarizes those obligations as of june  by type and by payment date 
the amounts represent the amounts contractually due and do not include any interest  premiums  discounts or other similar carrying value adjustments 
additional information on the terms of these obligations can be found in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
dollars are in thousands 

table of contents financial statement footnote reference less than one year one to three years three to to five years over five years total funding obligations deposits without a stated maturity certificates of deposit securities sold under agreement to repurchase borrowings junior subordinated debentures total funding obligations other obligations lease obligations purchase obligations total other obligation total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into arrangements that are not included in the statements of financial position 
they include commitments to make loans  commitments to sell loans  guarantees under letters of credit  interests in securities or derivatives used to hedge the value of loans held for sale and the use of wholly owned unconsolidated special purpose entities that act as trusts to facilitate the sale of debt securities to the public 
as a lending institution  the company makes commitments to lend money before loans are disbursed in order to serve the needs of borrowers 
at june   the company had commitments to make loans totaling million and these loan commitments are similar in form and terms to loans already recorded on the books 
they are underwritten using the same policies and criteria the company uses to underwrite loans 
therefore  these commitments do not present credit risks that are different from the credit risks in the existing loan portfolio 
the company does have interest rate risk on loan commitments and loans held for sale between the time a rate commitment is made to the borrower and the time the company contracts for the sale of the loan 
this risk is minimized by issuing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities to offset this interest rate risk 
at june   the company had million in mortgage loan commitments that are in the form of obligations to sell mortgage backed securities of like maturity and coupon to the loan commitments 
in addition  the company has a funding obligation represented by million in unused lines and letters of credit and million in construction loan funds approved that the borrower has not requested be advanced 
the company issues standby letters of credit for commercial customers to third parties to guarantee the performance of customers to those third parties 
if the customer fails to perform  the company performs in its place and treats the funds advanced as an interest bearing loan 
these letters of credit are underwritten using the same policies and criteria as commercial loans 
therefore  these standby letters of credit represent the same risk to the company as a loan to that commercial loan customer would 
at june   the company had million in standby letters of credit outstanding with an average remaining term of months 
while no liability has been recorded for the nominal amount of this obligation  the fair value of this obligation has been recorded in the form of unearned fees 

table of contents in december  the company formed two affiliated trusts that issued million of guaranteed capital trust securities 
these affiliates used the equity capital from the company and the proceeds of the guaranteed capital trust securities to purchase million in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures from the company 
the affiliates have no other operations 
based on the structure  nature and purpose of these affiliated trusts  the company has accounted for them using the equity method  and therefore they have not been included in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has guaranteed the securities issued by the affiliated trusts  however  this guarantee is recorded as a liability of the company in the form of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
for additional information on contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements  see the discussion of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations for years ended june  and general 
the company recorded net income for the year ended june  of million  an increase of or million  from net income of million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share for the year ended june  were  an increase of compared to for the year ended june  the increases in net income and diluted earnings per share were due primarily to increased assets and earnings related to the may  acquisition of franklin bancorp  inc for fiscal  returns on average equity roe and average assets roa were and  respectively  compared to and for fiscal net interest income  loan growth and deposit growth are all significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
a review of activity in interest rate over the past two years is helpful in understanding changes in volumes and the levels of certain income statement categories 
the chart below indicates the quarterly change in long term and short term interest rates represented by changes in the us year treasury bond rate and the target federal funds rate 
date us year treasury bond rate target federal funds rate while long term rates  represented by the year us treasury rate  have fluctuated primarily between and over the past two years  short term rates  as represented by the targeted federal funds rate  were stable during fiscal and rose steadily during fiscal  increasing basis points over the course of the year 
as a result the yield curve  which was relatively stable during fiscal  became progressively flatter throughout fiscal 
table of contents net interest income 
the table in the section titled average balances  interest rates  and yields provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income and the resulting asset yields in the following table are stated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  they will vary slightly from interest income in the consolidated statement of income included in the consolidated financial statements 
interest income for the year ended june  totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans partially offset by a reduction in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in average loan balances was primarily due to including a full year of the loans of the franklin division of first place bank in fiscal compared to one month in fiscal the yield on loans declined as we continued to experience the payoff of older high rate mortgage loans 
that decline was partially offset by increases in the yields on commercial and consumer loans due to increases on the prime lending rate during fiscal interest income on securities decreased million and totaled million for the year ended june  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in interest income on mortgage backed and other securities was due to a basis point increase in the average rate  partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance 
interest expense for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits increased by million to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  primarily due to the increase in average balances net of a small benefit from a decrease in the average cost of deposits 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to billion for the year ended june  compared to  million for the year ended june  the increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to including a full year of the deposits of the franklin division of first place bank in fiscal compared to one month in fiscal the average cost of deposits declined basis points to for fiscal compared with for the previous year 
that decline was due to the maturity of older high rate certificates of deposit partially offset by increases in the cost of checking  savings and money market accounts 
interest expense on short term borrowings increased million to million from million for the prior year primarily due to increases in short term interest rates during fiscal and to a lesser extent due to increases in the average balance of short term borrowings 
interest expense on long term borrowings increased million and was million for the year ended june   from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of long term borrowings partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average cost of long term borrowings 
the cost of long term borrowings includes the amortization of the losses from the termination of interest rate swaps in august those losses are being amortized over the original term of the swaps through interest rate swap amortization expense was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decline in the interest rate swap amortization accounted for basis points of the basis point decline in the cost of long term borrowings 
scheduled interest rate swap amortization for fiscal is million 
additional information can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june  totaled million versus million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets which was primarily due to the addition of assets from the franklin acquisition 
both asset yields and liability costs declined slightly during fiscal as older loans and certificates of deposits matured or were paid off and were replaced by new instruments at lower interest rates 
the net result was a basis point decrease in the interest rate spread 
the net interest margin increased basis points to for fiscal compared with for fiscal the increase in the margin was primarily due to the increase in noninterest bearing checking accounts of million to an average balance of for fiscal compared with for fiscal which was also primarily due to the franklin acquisition

the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which was a decrease of million from million for fiscal net charge offs declined million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net charge offs as a percent of average loans decreased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal taken together the provision and net charge offs for fiscal resulted in an increase of million or in the allowance for loan losses to million at june  compared with million at june  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans declined to at june  from a year earlier 
this was consistent with the change in nonperforming loans which increased on an absolute basis  but declined as a percent of loans 

table of contents noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased to million in the year ended june  from million for the prior year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a charge for other than temporary impairment of securities and a decline in the gain on the sale of loans partially offset by increases in service charges and other income generated by the bank 
in december the company recorded a million pretax charge for other than temporary impairment of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
when the market value of a security remains significantly below amortized cost impairment for an extended period of time  generally accepted accounting principles require a company to make a determination whether that impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
all of the securities currently on the books of the company are classified as available for sale 
therefore  all securities are recorded in the statement of condition at market value 
this is accomplished by a credit or charge to other comprehensive income  and those market value changes are not reflected in the income statement 
if securities are impaired and the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the securities are written down by reversing the existing charge to other comprehensive income and recording a charge to the income statement 
the freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stocks owned by the company had been impaired for approximately three years 
in order to determine the nature of that impairment the following factors were considered the likelihood that changes in interest rates would result in a recovery of impairment  the company s expectation for the direction and the magnitude of changes in interest rates  the level of confidence associated with the company s expectation of future interest rates  current ratings of fannie mae and freddie mac securities outstanding  alternative competing investments current available in the market  public knowledge about current operations at freddie mac and fannie mae  the political climate in which these agencies operate  and the length of time these securities have already been impaired 
our investigation of these issues revealed the following information about relevant events between september  and december  in december the securities and exchange commission recommended that fannie mae restate their financial statements to comply with statements of financial accounting standards nos 
and  in december the office of federal housing enterprise oversight indicated that fannie mae was significantly undercapitalized as of september  as a result of accounting mistakes  fannie mae had accepted the retirement of its ceo  the resignation of its cfo and had changed auditors all between december  and december between september  and december   the impaired securities declined million value in market value  which represented a decline in value even though the rates the securities are indexed to went up  and in december senators sununu  hagel and dole called for changes in the regulatory oversight of fannie mae and freddie mac based on fannie mae s recent problems with their financial statements and based on freddie mac s financial reporting problems in based on this and other information the company chose to take a conservative position in projecting the timing of recovery of impairment 
therefore  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to record a write down to recognize other than temporary impairment on all freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stocks in the company s securities portfolio that were impaired as of december  these stocks had a cost basis of million and were written down to their market value at december  of million 
this write down did not have any effect on total capital or the net asset value of the securities as they had already been recorded at market value as available for sale securities 
noninterest income also declined due to a decline in the net gains on sale of loans 
net gains on the sale of loans were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal gains in fiscal averaged basis points on million in sales compared with basis points on million of loan sales in fiscal 
table of contents the most significant difference between fiscal and was that the first quarter of fiscal was a very favorable market to originate and sell residential mortgage loans 
interest rates were at year lows and refinance activity was at record high levels 
during that quarter  the company realized gains on the sale of loans of million on sales of million of loans or an average of basis points 
during the remaining nine months of fiscal  the company realized gains of million on sales of million or an average gain of basis points 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal this increase was due to increases in checking account and atm fees that grew primarily due to the increase in checking accounts from the franklin acquisition 
other income bank increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal half of the increase was a payment of million  which represented the tax free proceeds of a life insurance policy on a former company executive 
the remainder was related to new banking services or an expansion in the level of existing services primarily due to the franklin acquisition 
loan servicing income was  for fiscal which represented a  increase over fiscal while these amounts were not significant when compared to net income in fiscal or fiscal the loan servicing operation is significant because it is sensitive to changes in interest rates and has the potential to have a significant impact on net income in fiscal and future years 
loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of msrs is a critical accounting policy and the company utilizes the services of an independent firm to determine market value 
both the amortization and the valuation of msrs are sensitive to movements in interest rates 
both amortization and impairment valuation allowances tend to increase as rates fall and tend to decrease as rates rise 
however  the level of amortization is a function of interest rates over the period while the level of impairment valuation allowances is a function of interest rates at the end of the period 
historically low interest rates over the past three years and volatility in rates recently have resulted in the increased variability of loan servicing income on a quarterly basis in spite of the lack of change between the current and prior fiscal years 
the table below shows how the change in the impairment of msrs impacts loan servicing income 
year ended june  loan servicing income loss loan servicing revenue net of amortization change in impairment of msrs total loan servicing income loss the reduction of the loss in loan servicing revenue net of amortization in the current year compared to the prior year was due to a slowdown in amortization of servicing rights due to loan payoffs 
the change in impairment was due to long term interest rates being significantly lower at june  than they were at june  whereas they were significantly higher at june  than they were at june  the remaining allowance for impairment of msrs at june  was million 
net gains on sale of securities were million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal securities may be sold to generate changes in liquidity  interest rate risk or maximize total returns on securities or minimize losses on securities in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate that gains on the sale of securities are currently or will be a significant component of net income 
however  the purchase and sale of securities do play a significant part in managing the overall liquidity  credit and interest rate risk of the company 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
the company has undertaken 
table of contents a number of expansion initiatives over the past two years which have resulted in increases in noninterest expense 
these initiatives have also resulted in significant increases in net interest income  service charge income and commercial loan originations 
the most significant initiative was the acquisition of franklin bancorp inc on may  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
therefore  the operating expenses of franklin are included in the consolidated financial statements beginning with the date of acquisition 
other initiatives during fiscal include expansion of the north olmsted  ohio loan production office to a business financial center  and the addition of loan production offices in carmel  indiana and in northville  jackson and holland  michigan 
these initiatives particularly impacted salaries and benefits and occupancy expenses 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased million to million for the current fiscal year compared with million for the prior year 
occupancy and equipment expenses were million for the year ended june   an increase of million over expense of million for the prior fiscal year 
professional fees were million for fiscal which was an increase of or million over fiscal the increase was due to additional independent audit costs and consulting costs to comply with sarbanes oxley act section  which relates to management s assessment of internal controls  outsourcing of the internal audit function for the first time in fiscal and from increased legal costs for delinquent loans as the company has grown due to the franklin acquisition 
marketing expense increased million or due to the franklin acquisition and due to increased advertising in ohio to increase market awareness of the first place name 
franchise tax expense decreased million or to million due to the impact of the franklin acquisition 
amortization of intangible assets increased million or due to amortization of the core deposit intangible asset from the franklin acquisition 
merger  integration and restructuring expense related to the franklin acquisition was million in fiscal compared to no expense in the current year 
other noninterest expenses increased million to million for the current fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was also primarily due to the increase in the size of the company as a result of the franklin acquisition and other expansion initiatives 
provision for income taxes 
income tax for the current fiscal year was million  an increase of million from the prior year expense of million 
the effective tax rate for the current fiscal year was compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the income tax expense was due to the increase in pretax income 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the million receipt of life insurance proceeds in the current year which was not subject to income tax

the company recorded net income for the year ended june  of million  a decrease of or million  from net income of million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share for the year ended june  were a decrease of compared to for the year ended june  the decrease in net income and earnings per share was due primarily to increases in non interest expense and the provision for loan losses  which were both impacted by merger related expenses 
for fiscal  returns on average equity roe and average assets roa were and  respectively  compared to and for fiscal net interest income 
the table above  in the section titled average balances  interest rates  and yields  provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income for the year ended june  totaled million a decrease of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans partially offset by a reduction in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in average loan balances was primarily due to the addition of commissioned loan officers  the addition of one new loan production office in fiscal  the addition of three loan production offices in fiscal  which were operating for a full year in fiscal and to a lesser extent the franklin acquisition 
interest rates during fiscal continued to remain at historically low levels resulting in a high level of refinance activity  which reduced the average yield on loans  compared to fiscal interest income on securities and interest bearing deposits decreased million and totaled million for the year ended june  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income on securities and interest bearing deposits was due to a million decrease in the average balance along with a basis point decline in average rate 

table of contents interest expense for the year ended june  was million  a decrease of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits decreased by million to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a decline in the average cost of interest bearing deposits from for the prior year ended june  to for the year ended june   a decline of basis points 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to  million for the year ended june  compared to  million for the year ended june  the increase was due to growth in interest bearing checking and money market accounts partially offset by a decline in higher costing time deposits 
interest expense on borrowings declined million to million from million for the prior year primarily due to a reduction in the average cost of borrowings as higher rate instruments matured and were replaced by lower rate instruments 
in addition  substantially all of the increase in the average balance occurred in short term fhlb advances  which significantly lowered the average cost of borrowings 
the average cost of borrowings also declined due to a decline in interest rate swap expense of million to million from million in the prior year 
the interest rate swaps were redeemed on august  at the fair value of million and a loss in other comprehensive income  net of tax  of million was recorded that will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining original terms of the individual interest rate swap contracts 
the amount amortized to expense in future periods is expected to be less than what the net interest cost would have been in each period under the prevailing lower interest rate environment that existed at the time the interest rate swaps were redeemed 
approximately of this expense will be recognized within the first three fiscal years beginning in the year ended june  with the remainder to be recognized in essentially equal annual increments through fiscal year additional information can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june  totaled million versus million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets 
both asset yields and liability costs declined during fiscal as paid off loans and maturing liabilities were replaced by new instruments at lower interest rates 
the company was able to hold the levels of interest rate spread and net interest margin within one basis point of prior year levels by changing the mix of assets to include relatively more loans and less securities and by utilizing low cost short term borrowings to finance growth 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which was an increase of million from fiscal expense of million 
the majority of that increase was due to a million provision related to the franklin bank loan portfolio 
that charge was recorded after the merger took place to reflect a change in the approach to managing credit issues at franklin and to conform franklin s practices to those that first place bank has used successfully to manage credit risk 
the remaining increase of million was due to growth in the loan portfolio and a change in the mix of loans to include relatively more commercial loans in fiscal compared to fiscal noninterest income 
noninterest income increased to million in the year ended june  from million for the prior year ended june  the increase was due primarily to an improvement in income from loan servicing 
loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of msrs is a critical accounting policy and the company utilizes the services of an independent firm to determine market value 
both the amortization and the valuation of msrs are sensitive to movements in interest rates 
both amortization and impairment valuation allowances tend to increase as rates fall and tend to decrease as rates rise 
however  the level of amortization is a function of interest rates over the period while the level of impairment valuation allowances is a function of interest rates at the end of the period 
historically low interest rates over the prior two years and volatility in rates near the end of fiscal have resulted in the increased variability of loan servicing income over the past two years 
the table below shows how the change in the impairment of msrs impacts loan servicing income 

table of contents year ended june  loan servicing income loss loan servicing revenue net of amortization change in impairment of msrs total loan servicing income loss the reduction of the loss in loan servicing revenue net of amortization in the current year compared to the prior year was due to a slowdown in amortization of servicing rights due to loan payoffs 
the change in impairment was due to interest rates being significantly higher at june  than they were at june  the effective yield on the ten year us treasury note  a primary factor in pricing fixed rate mortgage products  was more that basis points higher at june  compared to june  the remaining allowance for impairment of msrs at june  was million 
gains from the sale of loans totaled million for the fiscal year  a decline of million from million in the prior year 
gains in the current year averaged basis points on million of loan sales compared to gains averaging basis points on million of loan sales in the prior year 
sales margins were higher in fiscal as interest rates were on a downward trend throughout most of the year 
rates have trended upward through fiscal resulting in a narrowing of margins on the gain on sale of loans 
revenues from non bank businesses increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal this was primarily due to including a full year of revenue from two affiliates  apb financial group  ltd 
and majority ownership in titleworks  llc both acquired january noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
the company has undertaken a number of expansion initiatives over the past two years which have resulted in significant increases in noninterest expense 
these initiatives have also resulted in significant increases in residential loan originations and other non bank income 
the initiatives include having a full year of expenses for titleworks  apb  loan production offices in cincinnati  toledo and hudson  ohio  a financial center in solon  ohio and adding a wholesale residential lending department 
each of these initiatives was new during fiscal and only included a partial year of revenue and expense 
in addition  the current year included one month s expense from the franklin acquisition 
these initiatives particularly impacted salaries and benefits and occupancy expenses and to a lesser extent marketing and other expense 
salaries and benefits expense increased million to million for the current fiscal year compared to million for the prior year 
occupancy expenses were million for the year ended june   an increase of million over expense of million for the prior fiscal year 
merger  integration and restructuring expense related to the franklin acquisition was million in fiscal compared to no expense in the prior year 
these expenses included personnel  data processing  travel  and consulting expenses for legal  accounting and other services 
other noninterest expenses increased million to million for the current fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to a million charge related to aged outstanding reconciling items in the bank s primary correspondent bank account 
it was determined that these reconciling items were not likely to be recovered due to their age 
provision for income taxes 
income tax for the current fiscal year was million  a decrease of million from the prior year expense of million 
the decline was due to a decline in pretax income and a decline in the effective tax rate to for fiscal from for fiscal the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to permanent tax benefits recognized related to the company s employee stock ownership plan 

table of contents liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to generate adequate cash flows to meet the demands of its customers and provide adequate flexibility for the company to take advantage of market opportunities 
cash is used to fund loans  purchase investments  fund the maturity of liabilities  and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and sales of loans  maturities  sales and principal receipts from securities  borrowings  the issuance of debt or equity securities and operations 
managing liquidity entails balancing the need for cash or the ability to borrow against the objectives of maximizing profitability and minimizing interest rate risk 
the most liquid types of assets typically carry the lowest yields 
at june   the company had million of cash and unpledged securities available to meet cash needs 
unpledged securities can be sold or pledged to secure additional borrowings 
in addition  the company had the ability to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank based on loans currently pledged under blanket pledge agreements 
this compared to million of cash and unpledged securities and federal home loan bank availability of million at june  potential cash available as measured by liquid assets and borrowing capacity has decreased during fiscal as the company has increased its investment in loans and utilized some of its borrowing capacity to fund a portion of the loan growth 
in addition to the sources of funds listed above  the company has the ability to raise additional funds by increasing deposit rates relative to competition locally or in national markets  or to sell additional loans 
management believes that the current and potential resources mentioned are adequate to meet liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
first place financial corp  as a holding company  has more limited sources of liquidity 
in addition to its existing liquid assets it can raise funds in the securities markets through debt or equity offerings or it can receive dividends from the bank 
cash can be used by the holding company to make acquisitions  pay the quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures  pay dividends to common shareholders and fund operating expenses 
at june   the holding company had cash and unpledged securities of million available to meet cash needs 
annual debt service on the junior subordinated debentures is approximately million 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the holding company without prior approval of the ots 
generally the bank may pay dividends without prior approval as long as the dividend is not more than the total of the current calendar year to date earnings plus any earnings from the previous two years not already paid out in dividends  and as long as the bank would remain well capitalized 
the bank paid a dividend of million to the holding company in january and would not be able to pay any additional dividend as of june  without the approval of the ots 
future dividend payments by the bank will be based upon future earnings or the approval of the ots 
impact of inflation consolidated financial data included herein has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
presently  gaap requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or deflation are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of the company to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not move concurrently 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
a financial institution s ability to be relatively unaffected by changes in interest rates is a good indicator of its capability to perform in a volatile economic environment 
in an effort to protect itself from the effects of interest rate volatility  the company reviews its interest rate risk position frequently  monitoring its exposure and taking necessary steps to minimize any detrimental effects on the company s profitability 
critical accounting policies the company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
some of these accounting policies require management to make 
table of contents estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain 
application of assumptions different than those used by management could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
these policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
these policies include the policies to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights 
these policies  current assumptions and estimates utilized and the related disclosure of this process are determined by management and reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
details of the policies  the nature of the estimates  and the sensitivity of the estimates follow 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance based on a review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors 
loans are reviewed individually  or in the case of small homogeneous loans  in the aggregate 
this review includes historical data  the ability of the borrower to meet the terms of the loan  an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan  various collection strategies and other factors relevant to the loan or loans 
external factors considered include economic conditions  current interest rates  trends in the borrower s industry and the market for various types of collateral 
in addition  overall information about the loan portfolio or segments of the portfolio is considered  including industry concentrations  delinquency statistics and workout experience based on factors such as historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and current economic conditions 
as a result  determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses involves not only evaluating the current financial situation of individual borrowers or groups of borrowers but also current predictions about future cash flows that could change before an actual loss is determined 
based on the variables involved and the fact that management must make judgments about outcomes that are uncertain  the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy 
one of the tools utilized by management to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses is the grading of individual loans according to the severity of credit issue 
an illustration of the sensitivity of this system to changes in conditions or changes in estimates follows 
the most serious grading a loan can receive is to be classified as a loss 
a loan classified in the loss grade would be reserved and would be subject to charge off 
the next most serious grade is identified as doubtful 
at june   the company had million of loans classified as doubtful 
if all of these loans were to deteriorate and become classified as a loss the allowance for loan losses would need to increase by approximately million 
mortgage servicing rights 
when the company sells a mortgage loan and retains the rights to service that loan  the amortized cost of the loan is allocated between the loan sold and the mortgage servicing right retained 
the basis assigned to the mortgage servicing right is amortized in proportion to and over the life of the net revenue anticipated to be received from servicing the loan 
mortgage servicing rights are valued at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
fair value is measured by stratifying the portfolio of loan servicing rights into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
when the amortized cost of a group of loans exceeds the fair value  an allowance for impairment is recorded to reduce the value of the mortgage servicing rights to fair value 
fair value for each group of loans is determined quarterly by obtaining an appraisal from an independent third party 
that appraisal is based on a modeling process in conjunction with information on recent sales of mortgage servicing rights 
some of the assumptions used in the modeling process are prepayment speeds  delinquency rates  servicing costs  periods to hold idle cash  returns currently available on idle cash  and a discount rate  which takes into account the current rate of return anticipated by holders of servicing rights 
the process of determining the fair value of servicing rights involves a number of judgments and estimates including the way loans are grouped  the estimation of the various assumptions used by recent buyers and a projection of how those assumptions may change in the future 
the most important variable in valuing servicing rights is the level of interest rates 
long term interest rates are the primary determinant of prepayment speeds while short term interest rates determine the return available on idle cash 
the process of estimating the value of loan servicing rights is further complicated by the fact that short term and long term interest rates may change in a similar magnitude and direction or may change independent of each other 
the following table indicates how changes in assumptions about the prepayment speeds in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio would affect the fair value of the portfolio  as of the date of the most recent outside quarterly evaluation date  may  
table of contents fair value of mortgage servicing rights fair value of mortgage servicing rights assuming increase in prepayment speeds increase in prepayment speeds loan prepayment speeds have varied significantly over the past three years and could continue to vary in the future 
in addition  any of the other variables mentioned above could change over time 
therefore  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is  and is expected to continue to be  a critical accounting policy where the results are based on estimates that are subject to change over time and can have a significant financial impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to market risk 
market risk is the type of risk that occurs when a company suffers economic loss due to changes in the market value of various types of assets or liabilities 
as a financial institution  the company makes a profit by accepting and managing various risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk 
it is the risk that occurs when changes in market interest rates will result in a reduction in net interest income or net interest margin because interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities mature at different intervals and reprice at different times 
asset liability management is the measurement and analysis of the company s exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the objective of the company s asset liability management function is to balance the goal of maximizing net interest income with the control of risks in the areas of liquidity  safety  capital adequacy and earnings volatility 
in general  the company s customers seek loans with long term fixed rates and deposit products with shorter maturities which creates a mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
the company s primary strategy to counteract this mismatch is to sell the majority of long term fixed rate loans within days after they are closed 
the company manages this risk and other aspects of interest rate risk on a continuing basis through a number of functions including review of monthly financial results  rate setting  cash forecasting and planning  budgeting and an asset liability committee 
on a quarterly basis  the asset liability committee reviews the results of an interest rate risk model that forecasts changes in net interest income and net portfolio value npv  based on one or more interest rate scenarios 
npv is the market value of financial assets less the market value of financial liabilities 
npv is performed as of a single point in time and does not include estimates of future business volumes 
the model combines detailed information on existing assets and liabilities with an interest rate forecast  loan prepayment speed assumptions and assumptions about how those assets and liabilities will react to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  customer product and term selection  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as differences in how interest rates change at various points along the yield curve 
the results below indicate how npv would change based on various changes in interest rates 
the projections are as of june   and are based on an instantaneous change in interest rates and assume that short term and long term rates change by the same magnitude and in the same direction 

table of contents net portfolio value basis point change in rates net portfolio value ratio base the change in the npv ratio is a long term measure of what might happen to the market value of financial assets and liabilities over time if interest rates changed instantaneously and the company did not change existing strategies 
the actual results could be better or worse based on changes in interest rate risk strategies 
the above results indicate the company is exposed to a decline in npv if rates rise and would realize an increase in npv from falling rates 
the results of the projections are within parameters established by the board of directors 
in addition to the risk of changes in net interest income  the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to loans held for sale and loan commitments 
this is the risk that occurs when changes in interest rates will reduce gains or result in losses on the sale of residential mortgage loans that the company has committed to originate but has not yet contracted to sell 
the company hedges this risk by executing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities based on the volume of committed loans that are likely to close 
additionally  msrs act as a hedge against rising rates  as they becomes more valuable in a rising rate environment  offsetting the decline in the value of loan commitments or loans held for sale in a rising rate environment
