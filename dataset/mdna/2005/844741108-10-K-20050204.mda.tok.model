item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in  southwest posted a profit for its nd consecutive year  and th consecutive quarter 
southwest s profit of million exceeded our profit  excluding the impact of a federal government grant  by percent 
these achievements were accomplished despite record high energy prices  and aggressive industry growth  which contributed to the continuing weak airline revenue environment 
for the fourth consecutive year  the airline industry as a whole suffered a substantial net loss 
as a result  certain carriers filed for bankruptcy protection  and many carriers underwent or continued massive efforts to restructure their business  gain wage concessions from their employees  and slash costs 
to maintain its low cost competitive advantage  the company continued its company wide efforts to improve its cost structure 
as a result  the company increased productivity at all employee levels  and improved the overall efficiency of its operations 
in november  the company announced the consolidation of its reservations centers from nine to six  effective february of the  employees affected  approximately  did not elect to move to one of the company s remaining reservations locations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in second quarter  the company offered an early out option to substantially all employees  primarily in an effort to alleviate overstaffing in certain areas of the company 
the overstaffing primarily was the result of slower passenger growth  changes in customer buying habits and boarding processes  and the federalization of airport security 
due to these and other productivity efforts  the company s headcount per aircraft decreased from at december   to at december  as of december   the company has added blended winglets to approximately percent of its fleet of aircraft 
the addition of these wing enhancements  which are expected to be completed for all aircraft in early  extend the range of these aircraft  save fuel  lower potential engine maintenance costs  and reduce takeoff noise 
all new aircraft now arrive from boeing with winglets already installed 
the company expects annual fuel consumption savings of approximately percent for each aircraft outfitted with the winglets 
the company also phased out commissions on travel agency sales in  consistent with virtually all other us airlines 
this change in policy saved the company approximately million in demand for air travel was stronger in  albeit at depressed fare levels 
southwest had company record load factors for every month from march to july 
for full year  southwest s load factor was percent  which was up points from  and represented the second highest load factor in the company s history 
passenger revenue yield per rpm  on the other hand  was down percent compared to overall  unit revenues continue to run well below pre september   levels  and the percentage of customers traveling on full fares remains down from historical levels 
the company does not anticipate a complete recovery in revenues until full fare business travel fully recovers or there is a rationalization of industry capacity 
the company believes that  despite the difficult airline industry environment  it is well positioned to grow and remain profitable in the company s low cost competitive advantage  protective fuel hedging position  and excellent employees have allowed southwest to react quickly to market opportunities 
the company added philadelphia to its route system in may  and ramped up growth at chicago midway airport 
in fourth quarter  southwest was selected as the winning bidder at a bankruptcy court approved auction for certain ata airlines  inc ata assets  which ensures the company can continue to add low fare service in chicago 
as part of the transaction  which closed in december  southwest agreed to pay million for certain ata assets  consisting of the leasehold rights to six ata chicago midway airport gates 
table of contents and the leasehold rights to an aircraft maintenance hangar at midway 
southwest and ata have also agreed to a codeshare arrangement  which was approved by the department of transportation in january  in which each carrier will exchange passengers on select routes at midway 
the company believes this agreement could result in additional revenues of million to million  annually 
in addition  southwest has provided ata with debtor in possession financing and made other financial commitments to ata 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information

the company s load factor for rpms divided by asms was percent  compared to percent for although this represented a strong load factor performance for the company  passenger yields for passenger revenue 
table of contents divided by rpms remained under considerable pressure due to significant capacity increases by a large majority of carriers 
passenger yields for declined to  compared to 
in  a decrease of percent  because of heavy fare discounting arising as a result of the glut in industry seats available 
the company believes the pressure on passenger yields will continue into the foreseeable future  barring a dramatic decrease in industry capacity or a strong upturn in full fare travel 
however  continued industry discounting will most likely keep load factors at elevated levels compared to historical averages 
the company s january load factor was percent  which was points higher than january s load factor of percent 
however  we expect january s passenger unit revenues to fall below the year ago performance 
consolidated freight revenues increased million  or percent 
approximately percent of the increase was due to an increase in freight and cargo revenues  primarily due to more units shipped 
the remaining percent of the increase was due to higher mail revenues  as the us postal service shifted more business to commercial carriers 
other revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored chase formerly bank one visa card 
the company expects continued year over year increases in both freight and other revenues in first quarter  in comparison to first quarter  however  not at the rate experienced in operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased million  or percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity

the following presents southwest s operating expenses per asm for and followed by explanations of these changes on a per asm basis increase percent decrease change salaries  wages  and benefits fuel and oil maintenance materials and repairs agency commissions aircraft rentals landing fees and other rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses per asm increased percent to  primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices  net of hedging gains  and an increase in salaries  wages  and benefits 
these increases were partially offset by the company s elimination of commissions paid to travel agents  which was effective december  for first quarter  the company currently expects operating expenses per asm  excluding fuel  to decline from first quarter s unit costs  excluding fuel  of cents  primarily due to year over year decreases in salaries  wages  and benefits and maintenance costs per asm 
the expected decrease in salaries  wages  and benefits per asm will primarily be due to million in severance and relocation costs associated with the company s reservations center consolidation in first quarter for the year  the company expects unit costs  excluding fuel  to be lower than salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm increased percent  inclusive of million in additional expense from the profitsharing impact of the government grant

table of contents the government grant  approximately percent of the increase per asm was due to higher salaries expense  primarily from higher average wage rates  and percent was due to higher benefits costs  primarily health care and workers compensation 
for fourth quarter versus  salaries  wages  and benefits per asm decreased percent  as the company benefited from increased labor productivity 
this increase in productivity was driven primarily by headcount reductions from the company s reservations center consolidation and early out program during  and slowed hiring

fuel and oil expense per asm increased percent  primarily due to a percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon  net of hedging gains 
the average cost per gallon of jet fuel in was cents compared to cents in  excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities 
the company s and average jet fuel costs are net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the company has taken to better the fuel efficiency of its aircraft 
these steps primarily included the addition of blended winglets to of the company s aircraft as of december   and the upgrade of certain engine components on many aircraft 
the company estimates that these and other efficiency gains saved the company approximately million  at average unhedged market jet fuel prices 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has hedges in place for approximately percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in with a combination of derivative instruments that effectively cap prices at a crude oil equivalent price of approximately per barrel 
considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the company s fuel hedges  the company is forecasting first quarter average fuel cost per gallon  net of expected hedging gains  to exceed fourth quarter s average price per gallon of cents 
the majority of the company s near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts  which protect the company in the event of rising jet fuel prices and allow the company to benefit in the event of declining prices 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm were flat compared to currently  the company expects a decrease in maintenance materials and repairs expense per asm in first quarter  versus first quarter  due to a decrease in the number of scheduled maintenance events

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december  was million  compared to million as of december  estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded  exchanged  or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges  net of forfeitures  for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns  as noted  can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the 
table of contents company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  and promotional fare activity 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
furthermore  the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion at cost of long lived assets  including billion at cost in flight equipment and related assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are on operating lease 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated estimated useful life residual value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements years or lease term in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from boeing  the manufacturer of the company s aircraft 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by gaap 
when appropriate  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairments related to its 
table of contents existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made

see qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on sfas  the company s fuel hedging program  and financial derivative instruments 
sfas requires that all derivatives be marked to market fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over financial derivative instruments  related to fuel hedging  for the years through the fair value of the company s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   was million  compared to million at december  the large increase in fair value primarily was due to the dramatic increase in energy prices throughout  and the company s addition of derivative instruments to increase its hedge positions in future years 
changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically  as was evident during  based on changes in the underlying commodity prices 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
based on these actual results once all values and prices become known  the company s estimates have proved to be materially accurate 
estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under sfas to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result  as defined by sfas this could result in the immediate recording of charges or income  even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a 
table of contents future period 
historically  the company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under sfas  in relation to the fair value of the underlying financial derivative instruments 
sfas is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements including the documentation of a company hedging strategy  statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis  and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is executed by the company 
as required by sfas  the company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis 
the company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis 
this analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline 
the company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
the primary objective for the company s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
concurrently  the company s interest rate hedges are also intended to take advantage of market conditions in which short term rates are significantly lower than the fixed longer term rates on the company s long term debt 
during  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its million senior unsecured notes due  and million class a pass through certificates due the floating rate paid under each agreement sets in arrears 
under the first agreement  the company pays the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until the average floating rate paid under this agreement during is estimated to be percent based on actual and forward rates at december  under the second agreement  the company pays libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until based on actual and forward rates at december   the average floating rate paid under this agreement during is estimated to be percent 
during  the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement relating to its million senior unsecured notes due under this agreement  the company pays libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until the floating rate is set in advance 
the average floating rate paid under this agreement during was percent 
the company s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges  as defined by sfas in addition  these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges  as defined by sfas under the shortcut method  the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective  and  thus  there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  which are adjusted regularly  are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet  as necessary  with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  excluding accrued interest  at december   was a liability of approximately million 
this amount is recorded in other deferred liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with fair value hedging  the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments  and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
fuel hedging 
the company utilizes its fuel hedges  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
the company expects to consume billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year 
the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   were net assets of million 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is classified as fuel hedge contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is included in other assets 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december   levels  except underlying futures prices 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
the credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
at december   the company had agreements with seven counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels 
at december   the company held million in cash collateral deposits  and another million in us treasury bills  under these bilateral collateral provisions 
these collateral deposits serve to decrease  but not totally eliminate  the credit risk associated with the company s hedging program 
the cash deposits are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments 
table of contents of liabilities  the us treasury bills  supplied as non cash collateral by counterparties  are not reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
financial market risk 
the vast majority of the company s assets are expensive aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an a credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with standard poor s and fitch ratings agencies  and a baa credit rating with moody s rating agency 
the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
this includes the company s million senior unsecured notes due  the million class a pass through certificates due  and the million senior unsecured notes due although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 
excluding the million senior unsecured notes  and the million senior unsecured notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december  these senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the fixed rate portion of the company s pass through certificates consists of its class a certificates and class b certificates  which totaled million at december  these class a and class b certificates had a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december  the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled billion  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent at december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion at december  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money markets  investment grade commercial paper  and other highly rated financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than million 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 

table of contents the company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement  the revolving credit facility  and outstanding debt agreements 
covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings 
for the revolving credit facility  the company shall also maintain  at all times  a coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of not less than to the company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of december  however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements  it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written
