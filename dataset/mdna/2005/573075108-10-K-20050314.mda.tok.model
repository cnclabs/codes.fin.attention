item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the united states economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in the temperature sensitive market  and specific customer demand 
we monitor our revenue production primarily through revenue per tractor per week 
we also analyze our rates per total and loaded miles  non revenue miles percentage  and the miles per tractor we generate 
in discussing our results of operations  we have included in certain instances a discussion of revenue  before fuel surcharge and mwl revenue  or freight revenue 
we do this because we believe that eliminating these sources of revenue provides a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
our operating results for reflect improved average freight revenue per total mile compared with freight demand improved reflecting a combination of modestly improved economic conditions  the continuing industry wide constraint in the capacity of tractors with qualified drivers and our strategic emphasis on providing customers with high levels of service and significant tractor capacity 
in  we increased our operating revenue and our freight revenue compared with we were able to increase our freight revenue by increasing our freight rates and our detention charges  and by increasing our business with existing and new customers 
we increased our average operating revenue per tractor per week in  and our average freight revenue per tractor per week  due to a improvement in average freight revenue per total mile  partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor 
our weighted average number of tractors increased in however  an increase in our number of unseated tractors caused our weighted average number of seated tractors to increase by only in our profitability on the expense side is impacted by variable costs of transporting freight for our customers  fixed costs and expenses containing both fixed and variable components 
the variable costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and operating terminals 
although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control  we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business 
for example  fuel prices fluctuated dramatically and quickly at various times during and we manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers  as well as volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals 
the transportation industry is currently experiencing substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers 
during the third quarter of  we increased our driver incentives and continued to offer driver compensation that we believe ranks near the top of the industry 
like other companies in our industry  our insurance costs have increased dramatically over the last few years 
in order to control increases in insurance premiums  we maintain a self insured retention limit for auto liability claims of million per incident and for workers compensation claims of  per incident 
additionally  we operate in a highly competitive and regulated industry that is currently responding to significant regulatory changes regarding drivers hours of service 
the united states department of transportation  or dot  adopted revised hours of service regulations effective in january in response  we negotiated delay time charges with the majority of our customers 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the new hours of service regulations in their entirety and remanded the matter to the federal motor carriers safety administration  or fmcsa  for reconsideration 
in october  the surface transportation extension act of part v extended the current hours of service regulations until the earlier of the fmcsa developing a revised set of regulations or september  the regulations did not have a significant impact on our operations or financial results for by increasing our revenue and controlling our expenses  we improved our operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue to in from in we increased our earnings per diluted share to in from in  on a increase in weighted average shares outstanding attributable primarily to our public offering of common stock completed during the third quarter of our business requires substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly for new tractors and trailers 
at december   we had approximately million of long term debt  including current maturities  and million in stockholders equity 
in  we spent approximately million  net of trade ins  to purchase tractors and trailers 
we lowered the average age of our tractor fleet to years as of december  from years as of december  we also recognized a gain of million on the sale of used equipment in we estimate that capital expenditures  net of trade ins  will be approximately million for  primarily for new revenue equipment 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under our million revolving credit facility

our average operating revenue per tractor per week increased in from our average freight revenue per tractor per week increased in from  due to a increase in average freight revenue per total mile partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor 
our weighted average number of tractors increased in from however  an increase in our number of unseated tractors caused our weighted average number of seated tractors to increase by only in from salaries  wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees  including both driver and non driver employees  employees health insurance  k plan contributions  and other fringe benefits 
these expenses vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors  our efficiency  our experience with employees health insurance claims  changes in health care premiums  and other factors 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits resulted primarily from an increase in the size of our company owned fleet  partially offset by a decrease in our employees health insurance expense due to favorable claims experience causing a decrease of  in the estimated costs of our self insured medical claims in purchased transportation consists of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment and to carriers for transportation services arranged by mwl 
this category will vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors  the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors and the amount paid to carriers by mwl 
payments to carriers for transportation services arranged by mwl were million in no payments to carriers by mwl were recorded in the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors increased million in purchased transportation expense  excluding fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors and mwl carrier payments  decreased  or  in from this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of independent contractor owned tractors in our fleet  partially offset by a cent per mile increase in the amount paid to independent contractors effective april  fuel and fuel taxes  which we refer to as fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  increased million  or  to million in from million in our fuel prices  which remain high based on historical standards  significantly increased to an average of per gallon in from an average of per gallon in we have fuel surcharge provisions in substantially all of our transportation contracts and attempt to recover these increased expenses through fuel surcharges and higher rates 
we expect our fuel costs to increase in the future because we believe that government mandated emissions standards  which became effective october   have resulted in less fuel efficient engines  and that more restrictive emissions standards that take effect in will result in further declines in engine efficiency 
depreciation relates to owned tractors  trailers  communications units  and terminal facilities 
gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment are set forth in a separate line item  rather than included in this category 
the increase in depreciation was due to an increase in the relative percentage of company owned tractors to independent contractor owned tractors in this increase was more than offset by higher freight revenue per tractor in which more efficiently spread this fixed cost 
our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership may increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment  which would result in greater depreciation over the useful life 
insurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts  primarily for personal injury  property damage  physical damage to our equipment  cargo claims  and workers compensation claims 
these expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  our self insured retention levels  and the market for insurance 
the increase in insurance and claims in was comprised of a million increase in the cost of self insured accident claims and a  increase in insurance premiums 
we have maintained the self insured retention limit for our auto liability claims at million per incident and for our workers compensation claims at  per incident in our significant self insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods depending on the frequency  severity  and timing of claims and to adverse financial results if we incur large or numerous losses 
in the event of an uninsured claim above our insurance coverage  or an increase in the frequency or severity of claims within our self insured retention  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in  increases in the market value for used revenue equipment along with additional planned revenue equipment trades caused our gain on disposition of revenue equipment to increase to million from  in future gains or losses on disposition of revenue equipment are impacted by the market for used revenue equipment which is beyond our control 
other expense includes professional fees  driver recruiting and retention costs  trailer and drop yard rental  and other miscellaneous expenses 
the increase in other expense as a percentage of operating revenue was impacted by an increase of  in legal fees and a reversal in of a  accrual for a state sales tax claim which was dismissed in as a result of the foregoing factors  we improved our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  to in from in interest expense consists of interest on our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes 
these expenses are partially offset by interest income from the financing we provide to independent contractors under our tractor purchase program and from our investment in short term marketable securities 
the decrease in net interest expense was primarily the result of lower average debt balances outstanding in our effective income tax rate was in compared with in  because we increased our federal and state deferred income tax liabilities by a total of million during the fourth quarter of as a result of an increase in our statutory federal and state income tax rates based upon projected future taxable income

our weighted average number of tractors increased in from our average operating revenue per tractor per week increased in from our average freight revenue per tractor per week increased in from  due to a increase in average miles per tractor combined with a increase in average freight revenue per total mile 
in  salaries  wages and benefits decreased as a percentage of operating revenue but increased as a percentage of freight revenue to in from in the increase in salaries  wages and benefits resulted primarily from the increase in the size of our company owned fleet and million of additional compensation earned by our non driver employees under our incentive compensation program in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our employees health insurance expense due to a decrease in the estimated costs of our self insured medical claims of  primarily caused by an increase in the participants deductible levels in from  and a planned reduction in our student driver training expense from the increase in purchased transportation was due to a million increase in fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors and an increase in the average number of independent contractors from as a percentage of operating revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in as a percentage of freight revenue  purchased transportation  net of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors  decreased to in from in  primarily because of a decrease in the percentage of independent contractor owned tractors in our fleet

our fuel prices  which remain high based on historical standards  increased to an average of per gallon in from an average of per gallon in the increase in supplies and maintenance resulted from our larger fleet and the higher percentage of company owned tractors in our fleet  for which we bear all maintenance expenses 
we did not change our maintenance policy and our tractor and trailer fleets remained approximately the same ages 
depreciation decreased as a percentage of operating revenue in from  primarily because our trailer to tractor ratio decreased and higher freight revenue per tractor more efficiently spread this fixed cost 
this more than offset an increase in the relative percentage of company owned vehicles to independent contractor vehicles 
the increase in insurance and claims was caused by a  increase in insurance premiums which was partially offset by a  decrease in the cost of self insured accident and cargo claims 
in  the market value for used tractors improved while the market value for used trailers was consistent with as a result  our gain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to  in we incurred a loss of  on disposition of revenue equipment in the decrease in other expense was primarily due to the reversal of a  accrual  which was primarily established in  for a state sales tax claim dismissed during the third quarter of excluding the effect of the accrual and related reversal  other expense in was consistent with as a result of the foregoing factors  we improved our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  to in from in the decrease in net interest expense was primarily the result of lower average debt balances outstanding during the second half of  including the repayment of the outstanding balance due under our revolving credit facility  an increase in interest income from financing provided to independent contractors and earnings from short term marketable securities 
our effective income tax rate was in each of and as a result of the factors described above  net income increased  to million in from million in net earnings per share improved to per diluted share in from per diluted share in  despite an increase in weighted average shares attributable primarily to our public offering of common stock completed during the third quarter of liquidity and capital resources our business requires substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly for new tractors and trailers 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  our unsecured senior notes  our revolving credit facility  and our public offering of common stock completed during the third quarter of a portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment 
we have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractor or obtain financing through third parties 
however  to the extent we purchase tractors and extend financing to the independent contractors through our tractor purchase program  we have an associated capital expenditure requirement 
the table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities  net cash flows used for investing activities  and total long term debt  including current maturities  for the years indicated 
in thousands net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used for investing activities long term debt  including current maturities  at december in  we spent approximately million  net of trade ins  to purchase tractors and trailers 
we lowered the average age of our tractor fleet to years from years as of december  we also recognized a gain of million on the sale of used equipment in we estimate that capital expenditures  net of trade ins  will be approximately million for  primarily for new revenue equipment 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months 
over the longer term  based upon anticipated cash flows  current borrowing availability  and sources of financing we expect to be available to us  we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased a maintenance facility in indiana for million and spent  to expand our executive offices and principal terminal in wisconsin  using cash flows from our operations 
we have outstanding series a senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  these notes mature in october  require annual principal payments of million that began in october  and bear interest at a fixed rate of 
we also have outstanding series b senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  these notes mature in april  require annual principal payments of million that began in april  and bear interest at a fixed rate of 
we maintain an unsecured committed credit facility credit facility in the amount of million with two banks 
at december   the facility had an outstanding principal balance of million  outstanding letters of credit of million  and remaining borrowing availability of million 
this facility matures in april and bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate or the agent bank s prime rate  in each case plus applicable margins 
the interest rate for the facility was at december  our credit facility prohibits us from paying  in any fiscal year  dividends in excess of of our net income from the prior fiscal year 
the debt agreements discussed above also contain restrictive covenants which  among other matters  require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including debt to equity  minimum tangible net worth  cash flow leverage  interest coverage  and fixed charge coverage 
we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december  we had million in direct financing receivables from independent contractors under our tractor purchase program as of december   compared with million in receivables as of december  these receivables  which are collateralized by the tractors financed  are used to attract and retain qualified independent contractors 
we deduct payments from the independent contractors settlements weekly and  as a result  have experienced minimal collection issues for these receivables

off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements at december  inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  accident claims  health insurance  and employee compensation 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability 
we require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature control units on our trailers 
substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we historically have been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  increases usually are not fully recovered 
fuel prices were high throughout and  which has increased our cost of operating 
the elevated level of fuel prices is expected to continue in seasonality our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency  increased claims  and more equipment repairs 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
insurance and claims 
we self insure  in part  for losses relating to workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  along with employees health insurance with varying risk retention levels 
we maintain insurance coverage for per incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review 
however  we could suffer a series of losses within our self insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits  which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
we have maintained the self insured retention limit for our auto liability claims at million per incident and on our workers compensation claims at  per incident 
we have million in letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities 
the insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december   and million as of december  we reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
we periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical claims development factors 
we believe that our claims development factors have historically been reasonable  as indicated by the adequacy of our insurance and claims accruals compared to settled claims 
actual results could differ from these current estimates 
if our claims settlement experience worsened causing our historical claims development factors to increase by  our estimated outstanding loss reserves as of december  would have needed to increase by approximately million 
property and equipment 
the transportation industry requires significant capital investments 
our net property and equipment was million as of december  and million as of december  our depreciation expense was million for  million for and million for we compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset  reduced by its estimated salvage value  using the straight line method over its estimated useful life 
we determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment  prior useful lives  and changes in technology 
we have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years 
we believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of december  by approximately million  or impairment of assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
 as revised  requires entities to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the statement eliminates entities ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under sfas no 
 as originally issued 
sfas no 
 as revised  is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  accordingly  we will recognize the grant date fair value of stock options in our consolidated statements of operations beginning in our third quarter of as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements  the average stock based employee compensation expense  net of related tax effects  for through was  therefore  the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
however  the ultimate amount of increased compensation expense will be dependent on whether we adopt sfas no 
 as revised  using the modified prospective or retrospective method  the number of option shares granted during the year  their timing and vesting period  and the method used to calculate the fair value of the awards  among other factors 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the amendments also eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
forward looking statements and risk factors this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements 
such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of any statements not of historical fact may be considered forward looking statements 
written words such as may  expect  believe  anticipate  plan  goal  or estimate  or other variations of these or similar words  identify such statements 
these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially  depending on a variety of factors and risks  including but not limited to those discussed below 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on the results of our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  excess capacity in the trucking industry  strikes or other work stoppages  surpluses in the market for used equipment  interest rates  fuel taxes  license and registration fees  insurance premiums  and self insurance levels 
we also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on consumer confidence in the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 
in addition  our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
we compete with many other truckload carriers that provide temperature sensitive service of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers  railroads  and other transportation companies  many of which have more equipment  a wider range of services  and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages 
in particular  several of the largest truckload carriers that offer primarily dry van service also offer temperature sensitive service  and these carriers could attempt to increase their business in the temperature sensitive market 
many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business 
in addition  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved service providers  or conduct bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and in some instances we may not be selected as a core carrier or to provide service under such bids 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers 
for  our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  and our top two customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we do not expect these percentages to change materially for generally  we enter into one year contracts with our major customers  the majority of which do not contain any firm obligations to ship with us 
we cannot assure you that  upon expiration of existing contracts  these customers will continue to use our services or that  if they do  they will continue at the same levels 
in addition  our volumes and rates with our customers could decrease as a result of bid processes or other factors 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
we self insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  as well as employees health insurance 
we also are responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims 
we reserve currently for anticipated losses and expenses 
we periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience 
however  ultimate results may differ from our estimates  which could result in losses over our reserved amounts 
our self insured retention for auto liability claims is million per incident and for workers compensation claims is  per incident 
we have maintained these self insured retention levels for the increase in self insured retention could increase our claims expense or make our claims expense more volatile depending on the frequency  severity  and timing of claims 
accordingly  the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured  or the timing of such claims within a given period  could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with licensed insurance carriers 
although we believe the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims  it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits 
insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses  including trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expense could increase  or we could raise our self insured retention when our policies are renewed 
if these expenses increase  or if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits  or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided  results of our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
increases in compensation or difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
from time to time  the transportation industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
currently  competition for drivers is intense 
competition for drivers has increased compared with the past two years  and we have experienced greater difficulty in attracting sufficient numbers of qualified drivers 
in addition  due in part to current economic conditions  including the cost of fuel and insurance  the available pool of independent contractor drivers is smaller than it has been historically 
accordingly  we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers for all of our current tractors and for those we plan to add 
additionally  we may face difficulty in increasing the number of our independent contractor drivers  which is one of our principal sources of planned growth 
in addition  our industry suffers from high turnover rates of drivers 
our turnover rate requires us to recruit a substantial number of drivers 
moreover  our turnover rate could increase 
if we are unable to continue to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle 
in addition  our compensation of drivers and independent contractors is subject to market forces  and we may increase their compensation in future periods 
an increase in our expenses or in the number of tractors without drivers could materially and adversely affect our growth and profitability 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel may increase our cost of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we require large amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors and to power the temperature control units on our trailers 
fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 
fuel prices tend to fluctuate  and prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
we depend primarily on fuel surcharges  volume purchasing arrangements with truck stop chains  and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals to control our fuel expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect fuel surcharges or enter into successful hedges in the future 
fluctuations in fuel prices  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could adversely affect our results of operations 
seasonality and the impact of weather can affect our profitability 
our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency  increased claims  and more equipment repairs 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the dot and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  and insurance requirements 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
the dot adopted revised hours of service regulations effective in january in response  we negotiated delay time charges with the majority of our customers 
the regulations did not have a significant impact on our operations or financial results for in july  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the new hours of service regulations in their entirety and remanded the matter to the federal motor carriers safety administration  or fmcsa  for reconsideration 
in october  the surface transportation extension act of part v extended the current hours of service regulations until the earlier of the fmcsa developing a revised set of regulations or september  significant uncompensated shortfalls in our utilization due to compliance with the future regulations could adversely impact our profitability 
the engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions control regulations  which may substantially increase our operating expenses 
the environmental protection agency  or epa  adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through  for engines manufactured in october  and thereafter 
the new regulations decrease the amount of emissions that can be released by truck engines and affect tractors produced after the effective date of the regulations 
compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors  lowered fuel mileage  and increased our operating expenses 
some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices  in part to meet new engine design requirements imposed by the epa  and eliminated or sharply reduced the price of repurchase commitments 
these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations 
furthermore  even more restrictive epa engine design requirements will take effect in compliance with the epa standards is expected to result in further declines in fuel economy  and may result in further increases in the cost of new tractors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel and changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of diesel fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we presently use fuel surcharges to address the risk of high fuel prices 
fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers  though they can vary somewhat from customer to customer 
we believe fuel surcharges are effective at mitigating the risk of high fuel prices  although we do not recover the full amount of fuel price increases 
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates 
we have historically maintained a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
we did not have any interest rate swaps at december   although we may enter into such swaps in the future if we deem appropriate 
our fixed rate obligations consist of amounts outstanding under our unsecured senior notes 
the million outstanding at december   under our series a senior notes  bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
the million outstanding at december   under our series b senior notes  bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
based on such outstanding amounts  a one percentage point decline in interest rates would have the effect of increasing the premium we pay over market interest rates by approximately  annually 
our variable rate obligations consist of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate or the agent bank s prime rate  in each case plus applicable margins 
the interest rate for the facility was at december  as of december   we had borrowed million under the credit facility 
based on such outstanding amount  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would cost us  in additional gross interest cost on an annual basis
