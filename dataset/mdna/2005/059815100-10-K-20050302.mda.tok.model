item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview general the company has three reportable operating segments its traditional business which manufactures and sells precured tread rubber  equipment and supplies for retreading tires  tire distribution systems  inc tds which sells and maintains retread tires and new tires to principally commercial and industrial customers and speedco which provides quick service truck lubrication and tire service through company owned on highway locations in the united states 
bandag and its licensees have franchise locations worldwide  with located in the united states and internationally 
the majority of bandag s franchisees are independent operators of full service tire distributorships and the remaining are owned by tds 
the traditional business revenues primarily come from the sale of retread material and equipment to its franchisees 
tds offers complete tire management services including the complete line of bandag retreads  new tires commercial  retail and off the road  alignment and hour road service 
speedco provides quick service truck lubrication and tire service 
bandag anticipates strengthening speedco s success by adding more locations and tire capability while not compromising speedco s deserved reputation for convenient  quick  quality service 
a major component of the expansion is to modify all existing locations and build new locations to include a bandag designed and developed high speed tire sales and service capability 
all new locations will be built with a minimum of two high speed tire lanes 
the majority of the current locations will be modified to include two tire lanes with the exception of those locations where current sites are not large enough to add two lanes and the adjoining property is unavailable or cost prohibitive 
approximately of bandag s retread material sales in north america come from national account contracts with a variety of major fleets 
the depth of the company s franchisee network combined with the quality of its products has allowed bandag to build a significant national account business 
significant fleet revenue is important to bandag s franchisees who act with bandag as subcontractors to deliver products  information and services to national fleet customers 
bandag s franchise agreements require its franchisees to buy their precured retreading material and equipment from bandag  which gives bandag a secure revenue stream 
growth in revenue can be achieved by expanding the amount of services that can be provided to a fleet by bandag and its franchisees while continuing to provide value added retread products 
bandag also generates significant cash flow which has historically been used to reinvest in the business  make debt payments  pay dividends  repurchase stock and other corporate purposes 
despite an aggressive push by competitors in the unites states retread business  bandag has retained its leading position 
in addition to its leading presence in the united states  bandag also has an important presence internationally in europe  canada  mexico  brazil  south africa and australia 
trucking industry while shippers apply pressure to fleets from the service side  pressure on fleets from the cost side continues to intensify 
high insurance costs  increased driver wages and higher fuel costs continue to increase the pressure on fleets to find ways to reduce costs 
also  on august   the federal motor carrier safety administration filed a final rule for hours of service of drivers  applying to all commercial motor vehicles and mandating how long drivers can drive  be on duty  rest  etc 
among other things  the new rule lengthens the allowable driving time from hours to hours and limits total daily time on duty which includes loading  unloading  breaks and breakdown time to hours 
this new regulation went into effect january  the pressure to reduce costs and still meet shipper demands requires fleets to focus on increasing revenue through better asset utilization 
fleets are looking for ways to reduce costs and to reduce the assets that are used to generate revenues 
they are focusing  not just on reduction of downtime  but on better utilization of downtime that is mandated through regulation eg when the truck is down due to regulated drive rest time  fleets will seek to use that time for vehicle maintenance 
fleets  particularly truckload carriers  will likely focus more on preventive maintenance and other services and products  such as those provided by bandag  that can provide more reliable utilization of their assets 
new tire retread pricing and profitability the relationship between new tire pricing and retread unit pricing has been narrowing primarily due to retread unit prices increasing at a faster rate than new tires and lower priced imported new tires entering the market 
generally  a decreasing new tire to retread price ratio will put downward pressure on retread pricing and tend to increase the use of relatively less expensive new tires instead of retreads 
increases in imports of low priced new tires and the movement of major new tire manufacturers to lower their costs by utilizing overseas production has exacerbated this situation 
however  there still remains an inherent value in retreading to fleets that recognize the need for a well managed tire program that combines quality new tires  retreads and tire management services to reduce operating costs 
acquisitions on february   the company acquired an majority interest in speedco  inc from its founders and equilon enterprises  llc  a royal dutch shell group company 
in total  bandag paid approximately  net of cash received  for its interest and to assume and retire  of debt 
the company recorded  of goodwill and  of other intangible assets 
speedco generated unaudited revenues of approximately  and unaudited pre tax income of approximately  in the company reports speedco as a separate segment 
on june   speedco  inc acquired the assets of six licensed locations  which were owned and operated by pm express  inc speedco paid approximately  net of cash acquired  for these assets 
the company recorded  of goodwill 
these locations generated unaudited revenues of approximately  and unaudited pre tax income of approximately  in during  the company s tds segment acquired seven commercial and retail outlets and two retread plants for  sale of tds locations bandag s tds subsidiary sold or closed locations during  locations during and locations during the company considers tds to be essential in order to protect bandag s distribution where no independent bandag franchise exists 
bandag will continue to divest tds locations where an independent bandag dealer is willing to buy the location and when it is a sensible decision for the company to sell 
bandag will also continue to purchase locations for tds if it is necessary to maintain bandag s distribution in an area 
in currently unprofitable locations where tds must operate to maintain bandag s presence to serve its fleet customers  the company intends to continue to improve operational efficiencies to achieve profitability 
during  the company s tds segment sold locations with a net carrying value of  for cash of  and assumed liabilities of  the assets of these locations consisted primarily of inventory and property  plant and equipment 
the divestitures resulted in a loss before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting change of  which was recorded in engineering  selling  administrative and other expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
during  tds also closed two locations 
in conjunction with the divestiture of certain tds locations in  bandag guaranteed a portion of third party loans to a dealer 
bandag s exposure under these guarantees is  the guarantees are secured by assets of the dealer 
the remaining term of the guarantees is two years 
the fair value of the guarantees  which was originally determined to be  and is currently valued at  is included in long term debt and other obligations in the company s consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting charge of  included in engineering  selling  administrative and other expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings in the divested and closed locations had net sales and loss before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting change as follows in thousands year ended december  net sales    loss before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting change  outsourcing agreement on may  bandag announced that yellow roadway corporation elected on april  not to renew the existing bandag outsourcing agreement for roadway express tire and wheel services in place since and  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  would be repurchasing the tire and wheel assets from bandag 
on july  bandag received an initial payment of approximately  and received a final payment of approximately  on july  these tire and wheel assets had net carrying values of approximately  and  as of june  and december   respectively  and were classified with other current assets in the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets 
bandag s annual revenues under the contract in  including revenue derived from sales of retread materials to dealers performing services under the agreement  were approximately  bandag estimates that the agreement contributed approximately  to consolidated net earnings in  or approximately per diluted share 
the foregoing discussion concerning the economic contribution attributable to the roadway express agreement in overstates the potential financial impact to bandag on the termination of the agreement since it does not take into account or reflect the contribution to earnings which bandag will recognize upon the investment of the proceeds derived from the sale of the tires and wheels to yellow roadway corporation 
sale of south africa operations effective december   the company sold the business of bandag in south africa 
due to the foreign operations reporting on a one month lag  this transaction will not be recorded until these operations represent less than of net sales and total assets of the company and contributed approximately  and  to pre tax income in and  respectively 
the purchase price of approximately  consists of a cash payment of approximately  with the remainder to be paid in equal installments over five years 
the actual payment in us dollars will depend on the currency fluctuations of the euro and the south african rand over the five year period 
in relation to the installment payments  bandag is considered the primary beneficiary under fasb interpretation no 
 revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
under the guidance of fin r bandag will continue to consolidate the south african operations on its financial statements as long as bandag is considered to be the primary beneficiary 
although determination of bandag as the primary beneficiary could change based on changes in the capitalization of the south african operations  based on the current facts  bandag would be considered the primary beneficiary until final payment has been made 
as a result  bandag must defer recognition of the expected net loss of approximately  to  or approximately to diluted earnings per share  until the earlier of final payment of the five year obligation  which is expected to be december   or until it is no longer considered the primary beneficiary within the meaning of fin r 
the expected loss may fluctuate over the five year period depending on the stability of the euro and the south african rand 
the expected loss is primarily due to the cumulative translation adjustment of approximately  that is recorded in the bandag consolidated balance sheet related to the south african operation 
the expected loss will not affect bandag s cash flow  but rather will be an accounting entry which will reduce net earnings

traditional business north america north america sells to independent dealers as well as to tds and other subsidiaries 
sales to tds and other subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation 
accordingly  as tds locations are divested and become unaffiliated bandag customers  sales to independent dealers should benefit 
the table below depicts the breakout of north america s retread product sales between tds and independent dealers in thousands year ended december  retread product sales increase decrease sales to independent dealers   sales to tds   total retread product sales   the increase in retread product sales to independent dealers is due to several factors including a increased sales to independent dealers that purchased tds locations  b the effect of translating canadian dollar denominated sales to us dollars of  and c the impact of a january  price increase 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in volume 
the decrease in retread product sales to tds is primarily due to the divestitures and closures of tds locations

to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by increases in oil prices the company increased selling prices in the united states and canada effective december  and increased selling prices in some foreign locations during the year 
the company may continue to increase prices if raw material costs rise further  however  due to competitive pressure and the decreasing difference between the price on a bandag retread and a substitute new tire  the company believes its ability to continue to pass on such increases may be diminished 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the agreements 
replacement of fixed assets requires a greater investment than the original asset cost due to the impact of general price level increases over the useful lives of plant and equipment 
this increased capital investment would result in higher depreciation charges affecting both inventories and cost of products sold

net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was  primarily due to net earnings and depreciation 
the only changes in working capital requirements are for normal business growth 
the company typically funds its capital expenditures from operating cash flows 
during  the company spent  for capital expenditures as compared to  in the company anticipates capital expenditures of  to  in the increase in capital expenditures in and is primarily due to expenditures made and to be made by speedco for new facilities and expansion of existing facilities

the actual payments will range from to the total obligated amounts 
standby letters of credit are provided to the company s insurance administrators to cover costs associated with self insurance liabilities 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices 
to mitigate such risks  the company enters into various derivative transactions 
all derivative transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined company policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
analytical techniques and selective derivative instruments are applied to manage and monitor such market exposures 
foreign currency exposure foreign currency exposures arising from cash flow transactions include firm commitments and anticipatory transactions 
translation exposure is also part of the overall foreign exchange risk 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risks exists primarily with the brazilian real  canadian dollar  mexican peso  japanese yen and european union euro 
the company regularly enters into foreign currency contracts primarily using foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage the foreign currency risks associated with most of its firm commitment exposures 
the company also employs foreign exchange forward contracts as well as option contracts to manage the foreign currency risks associated with approximately of its anticipated future cash flow transactions within the coming twelve months 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  and were  and  respectively 
the company also limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into offsetting asset or liability positions and by establishing and monitoring limits on unmatched positions 
the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate was  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
on that basis  the potential loss in the value of the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have been  in and  in the company also has foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of the company s net equity investment in its foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
the company generally views as long term its investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed are the european euro  brazilian real  mexican peso  canadian dollar and south african rand 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels would have impacted the company s net foreign investments by  and  at december  and  respectively 
interest rate exposure in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  the company generally maintains a large portion of its debt as fixed rate in nature by borrowing on a long term basis 
at december  and  the company had outstanding debt of  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt was  and  respectively 
in addition  at december  and  the fair value of securities held for investment was  and  respectively 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt and its securities held for investment would not be materially affected by a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
therefore  the effects of interest rate changes on the fair value of the company s financial instruments are limited 
securities held for investment primarily consist of obligations of states and political subdivisions of a short term nature 
commodities exposure due to the nature of its business  the company procures almost all of its synthetic rubber  which is the predominant raw material used in manufacturing tire tread  at quarterly fixed rates using contracts with the company s main suppliers 
historically  the company increases its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect significant changes in commodity costs  however  due to competitive pressures and the decreasing difference between the price on a bandag retread and a substitute new tire  the company believes its ability to continue to pass on such increases may be diminished 
to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by increases in oil prices  the company increased selling prices in the united states and canada effective december  and increased selling prices in some foreign locations during the year 
therefore  the company s exposure is limited to the extent selling price increases fail to offset increases in commodity costs 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the related agreements 
critical accounting policies bandag s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management s discussion and analysis disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable bandag s global credit policies are corporately determined and managed through business unit credit and financial management departments to insure compliance with local laws and to effect proper credit and collections at the country level 
a significant percentage of the company s global accounts receivable are obligations of franchisees 
the majority of these accounts receivable are extended within north america 
however  bandag competes in the global marketplace and credit is also extended outside of the united states 
bandag continuously monitors political  social and economic risks to insure sound credit decisions are made within these foreign markets 
bandag also extends credit in north america to customers in the trucking and transportation industry 
credit is extended to large national and regional customers on a contractual basis through bandag 
smaller regional and local trucking customers are provided credit through tds 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected 
general reserves for bad debts are maintained based upon the length of time the receivables are past due and upon historical write off experience by geographic location 
credit losses have been within management s expectations 
goodwill and trade name asset valuation the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and trade name assets annually utilizing discounted cash flow models 
changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or changes in market conditions could negatively affect the reporting unit s goodwill and trade name assets fair value and result in an impairment charge 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and trade name assets that totaled  at december  however  the current fair values of the company s reporting unit s goodwill and trade name assets are in excess of carrying values  and accordingly management believes that only significant changes in cash flow assumptions would result in impairment 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recorded to reflect the future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities 
at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of  this balance consists of approximately  of net deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing of income and deductions for tax versus books  and  of net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are provided under the assumption that all profits of the foreign subsidiaries will be repatriated to the united states and all foreign taxes paid will be available to offset united states taxes 
in addition  any deferred tax asset is reviewed annually to determine the probability of realizing the asset 
if it is determined unlikely that the asset will be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance is established against the asset 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further details 
the company believes it has a reasonable basis in the tax law for all of the positions it takes on the various federal  state and foreign tax returns it files 
however  in recognition of the fact that various taxing authorities may not agree with the company s position on certain issues  that the cost of litigation in maintaining the positions that the company has taken on various issues might be significant  and that the taxing authorities may prevail in their attempts to overturn such possibilities  the company maintains tax reserves 
these reserves  the potential issues they are intended to cover  as well as their adequacy to do so  are reviewed both internally and with outside tax professionals on a regular and frequent basis 
periodic adjustments are made to such reserves to reflect the lapsing of statutes of limitations  closings of ongoing examinations or commencement of new examinations  and changes in tax law or interpretations of tax law 
the company has completed a preliminary analysis of the repatriation provisions provided by the american jobs creation act the act that was signed into law on october  the act created a special one time tax deduction relating to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings during either or it was determined that the act provided no benefit to the company for any foreign earnings repatriated during the year ended december  and therefore no amounts have been recognized in the financial statements under the repatriation provision 
analysis is not yet complete for amounts that may be repatriated during the year ended december marketing programs distribution management request dmr is a marketing program designed to increase company market share by enhancing dealer capability and franchise value 
enhanced dealer capabilities and franchise values are achieved primarily through company provided financial assistance towards the acquisition of equipment  service vehicles  facility expansions and other items aligned with company goals 
under the dmr program  the company provides financial assistance primarily in the form of dmr promissory notes from the dealer to bandag
