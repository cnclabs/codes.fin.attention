cost of revenues and gross margins 
we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain or improve our gross margins 
the major items impacting cost of consulting  cost of software maintenance and cost of software implementation are driven by personnel overhead and related expenses 
the major items impacting cost of software licenses are amortization of both capitalized and acquired software and also software royalties for software from third parties 
while the amortization expense is relatively fixed  the third party royalty expense can vary significantly based on the relative product mix 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative and research and development  are substantially driven by personnel and overhead expenses 
other significant operating expenses that we monitor include professional fees  use of contractors  travel  insurance and office services expenses 
additionally in fiscal  the settlement of the epg legal action along with associated legal fees was recorded on the restructuring and other charges financial statement caption on the consolidated statement of operations 
liquidity and cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents at january  and totaled million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities  used million of cash for investing activities and used million for financing activities 
our primary utilization of cash in fiscal was to reduce our debt under our revolving credit agreement  and to invest in our development lab infrastructure along with the development costs associated with building several new product offerings  especially within our gpt business segment 
executive summary in fiscal  we generated revenue of million and a net loss of million 
through continuing efforts to improve quality and efficiency throughout the company  we generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal this cash flow allowed us to pay down the remaining million of our million revolving credit agreement  along with making several investments which enhance and expand our current product offerings 
additionally  we have upgraded both the hardware and software within our development lab in charlotte  north carolina 
while we have made progress in reducing both our cost of revenues and sg a expenses  our profitability was hampered by the unfavorable jury verdict awarded to earnings performance group epg in may the ultimate settlement and legal fees totaled approximately million 
in addition  we increased our level of research and development expenses approximately million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal within our revenue enhancement reve segment  we experienced million  or  growth within our traditional reve contingent consulting revenues  however  we experienced a decline of million  or  within our customer value enhancement cve software and proprietary sales management revenue 
traditional consulting revenues increased in both the domestic and international markets 
the cve decline was primarily the result of the market softening for traditional customer relationship management crm license sales  and in response we have reformulated the cve business model to reflect term software license arrangements as opposed to traditional perpetual license arrangements 
this change in strategy appears to be gaining acceptance  and in november the cve group entered into a year term license with a top us bank that will increase software and maintenance revenue beginning in fiscal additionally  in early fiscal  we also contracted with a large international bank for a similar multi year engagement 
fiscal was a year of transition for the global payments technology gpt segment 
several new products were launched such as exchglink  image inspector and ird author 
however  we had to shift our image technology strategy during the middle of fiscal because of a change in our market s approach to image exchange and our target customers timing on implementing these solutions 
additionally in fiscal  we were late to market with our anti money laundering technology 
we just recently introduced the latest components of our core carreker online risk expert solution suite 
core fraud manager is a platform that integrates enterprise level risk management for compliance monitoring and fraud detection 
the new products are core fraud manager wires and core fraud manager aml 
these factors had a negative effect on gpt revenues 
for fiscal  total gpt revenues declined million  or  as compared to fiscal our global payments consulting gpc segment experienced revenue growth of approximately  or  in fiscal these results reflect an expanded sales focus in this segment as we repositioned this business to focus on check enterprise wide payment electronification strategies  image enablement planning and integration and enterprise risk 
new leadership has helped refine our consulting offerings with a clear value proposition 
finally  carretek is our owned business outsourcer for payment and transaction processing 
carretek was formed in fiscal and signed its first agreement in the second quarter of fiscal fiscal revenues have been minimal  however in late january  we expanded the scope of our outsourcing engagement with this single customer to include a second set of transaction processing functions 
even with this expanded scope  we do not expect this business to be profitable until the scope with this single customer is expanded to its full capacity or until additional customers are added 
we have continued throughout fiscal to focus on reducing general and administrative costs to help fund increasing sales and marketing costs in both gpt and gpc  along with increasing research and development costs to enhance our existing product offerings and more importantly  develop new product offerings 
we managed to these objectives  however with the increase in our restructuring and other charges  which included the epg settlement noted above  our total operating costs were essentially flat in fiscal  as compared to fiscal we are continually evaluating overall expense levels and remain focused on cost containment initiatives

fy fy fy revenue enhancement     global payments technologies     global payments consulting    outsourcing revenue total revenues     the decline in revenue within our reve segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of a million  or  decline in our cve software and proprietary sales management revenue 
in fiscal  the market softened for traditional crm license sales and in response we have reformulated the cve business model to reflect term software license arrangements as opposed to traditional perpetual license arrangements 
this change in strategy appears to be gaining acceptance as the cve group signed one large term license engagement late in fiscal and have signed another similar engagement internationally in early fiscal the increase in revenue within the reve segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of increased demand for our cve software offering 
cve revenue increased million  or  in fiscal this demand was being driven by the trend among our customers to expend investments in branch locations  resulting in pressure to show greater returns on these branch investments through profitable sales growth  which our cve solution helps generate 
the declines in revenue within gpt that began in fiscal also carried over into fiscal the lack of a strong backlog of contracted sales from fiscal and reduced contracted sales activity in q and q contributed to the reduced revenue 
the decline in sales activity was primarily related to delays in our delivery of new solutions to the market and to unanticipated delays in technology investments by our customers 
we also believe some of these delays are due to the fact that we bundle our solutions  which cause a slower sales cycle but typically provides a better value for our customers and the company 
the decline in revenue within the gpt segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of four factors i fiscal had a number of transactions for software included in the results for the year that did not involve implementation services and hence revenue was recognized immediately increasing software license revenue in fiscal  ii decisions on technology investments and services projects were delayed out of fiscal by several of our customers due to the announcement of several mergers involving our customers  iii customer decisions on technology investments were delayed generally out of fiscal as the industry  our customers  other key constituencies eg federal reserve and key processors and our competitors focused on check readiness and opportunities  and iv the loss of a few opportunities to competitors as these competitors dramatically improved their software offerings and services and offered aggressive pricing proposals 
the increased revenues within gpc in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflects the result of expanded sales focus as we completed the repositioning of this business to focus on check enterprise wide payment electronification strategies  image enablement planning and integration and enterprise risk 
additionally  new leadership in this business was introduced in q to capitalize on the synergistic nature of the gpc and gpt business segments and refine our solutions with a clear value proposition 
the decline in revenues within our gpc segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of three primary factors 
in fiscal  the majority of the consulting work performed by gpc was the result of bank consolidation and staff augmentation assignments 
the demand for both of these types of work has declined significantly 
late in fiscal  we began to reposition this segment to address enterprise wide payment electronification strategies and image enablement planning and integration 
the timeframe to accomplish these objectives has been longer than anticipated  and carried over into fiscal our outsourcing revenue is derived through carretek  our owned business which offers outsourcing for payment and transaction processing 
carretek was formed in fiscal and signed its first agreement in the second quarter of fiscal the fiscal revenues have been minimal  however in late january  we expanded our scope with this single customer to include a second set of transaction processing functions 
overall  as we look across our three major business segments along with carretek  we believe that we are well positioned  and have a competitive advantage  to capitalize on the significant changes brought about by the check legislation  usa patriot act and basel ii through our subject matter expertise in the impacted areas 
based on this outlook  we anticipate contracted sales will improve in fiscal as an expanded array of new products are available and have solid references 
consulting fees in thousands vs

in fiscal  we had revenue producing engagements of which were international and these international engagements yielded of reve s consulting revenues 
this compares to active engagements of which were international in fiscal and active engagements of which were international in fiscal additionally  reve consulting revenue derived from international customers increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal we anticipate that reve consulting revenues in fiscal will be higher than fiscal levels 
consulting revenues derived from our gpc segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in consulting revenue in fiscal is attributable to the momentum gained as we completed our repositioning of this business to focus on check enterprise wide payment strategies and image enablement planning and integration 
the decline in consulting revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the fact that the majority of work performed by gpc in fiscal and prior years was related to banks consolidating and reducing redundant operations  and to staff augmentation assignments 
during fiscal  the demand for this type of work declined significantly and in fiscal we took the necessary steps to reposition this business as described above 
while we have gained some momentum in these areas  we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the future prospects of the gpc segment 
software license fees in thousands vs 
vs 
fy fy fy software license fees     the majority of our software license revenues are derived from our gpt business segment 
software license revenues from our gpt business segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased in fiscal from million in fiscal license revenues peaked during the first two quarters of fiscal due to sales of million of software expansion licenses which did not require any implementation services and therefore were recognized immediately 
in the latter half of fiscal  the number and dollar amount of our software license arrangements began to decline 
the decline was in part due to the uncertainty of our special review and ultimate financial statement restatement  however  our customers also began to delay their purchasing decisions due to both economic and legislative changes within the banking industry  namely check  which was ultimately signed into law in october and went into effect in october check permits us banks to accept digital images of checks the same way they accept a paper check 
several new product initiatives were launched in the latter half of fiscal and continued into fiscal while these products can operate independently and even with other vendor software  these products were developed to be bundled together to provide one total solution to our customers which we believe provides increased value 
this bundling also tends to delay the sales cycle 
we believe that our customers investment decisions and the timing of these decisions have become increasingly visible in the latter half of fiscal combining these factors  we are cautiously optimistic about deriving license revenue growth for fiscal  as compared to fiscal levels 
software license revenues from our cve product line  within the reve business segment  decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased in fiscal from  in fiscal the decline in fiscal and the increase over fiscal was primarily the result of two large international engagements performed in fiscal also in fiscal and carrying over until fiscal  this group lacked sales leadership and capacity 
two new sales persons were hired in the quarterly period ended october   and in november the cve group signed a multi year contract to provide software  services and maintenance to a large domestic bank 
however  the impact on fiscal was negligible 
software maintenance fees in thousands vs 
vs 
fy fy fy software maintenance fees     as with software license fees the majority of our maintenance fees are derived from our gpt business segment 
software maintenance fees are paid pursuant to annually renewable product and telephone support agreements with our software customers 
the annual maintenance fee is generally paid by the customer at the beginning of the maintenance period and we recognize this maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the related contract 
if the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning of the maintenance period  we defer revenue recognition until the time that the maintenance fee is paid by the customer 
when the payment is received  maintenance revenue is recognized for the period that maintenance revenue was previously deferred 
also  maintenance contracts usually carry annual maintenance fee escalation clauses typically based on an index  such as the consumer price index 
while we did increase the maintenance fees for selected customers and products in fiscal  these increases were offset by a major customer that gave notice of their intent to not renew their million maintenance contract for fiscal the increase in maintenance fees in fiscal is due primarily to the expanded product installation base of the products acquired in the check solutions acquisition in fiscal we are projecting a flat to slightly higher maintenance revenue in fiscal over fiscal maintenance revenue levels 
software implementation fees in thousands vs 
vs 
fy fy fy software implementation fees     the majority of our software implementation fees are derived from our gpt business segment 
in the majority of our customer arrangements  installation services are provided to the customer 
in fiscal and  the decline in software implementation fees paralleled the decline in software license fees 
we estimate modest growth in fiscal for software implementation revenue consistent with our anticipated modest increase in software license revenue 
outsourcing service fees in thousands vs 
vs 
fy fy fy outsourcing service fees our outsourcing service revenue is derived through carretek  our owned business which outsources payment and transaction processing 
carretek was formed in fiscal and signed its first agreement in the second quarter of fiscal the fiscal revenues have been minimal  however in late january  we expanded our scope of business with this customer to include a second set of transaction processing functions 
given our current outlook  we believe that the revenues derived from this business will increase significantly on a percentage basis over fiscal levels and increase modestly on an absolute dollar basis 
out of pocket expense reimbursements in thousands vs 
vs 
fy fy fy out of pocket expense reimbursements    the decrease in these reimbursements in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is the result of the decline in implementation engagements within the gpt business segment 
the decrease in these reimbursements in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily due to the decline in the volume within our gpc business segment 
the majority of these gpc engagements in fiscal was related to staff augmentation assignments which required our employees to be at the customer location for extended periods of time  which gives rise to higher out of pocket expense reimbursements 
in fiscal  we expect these reimbursements to increase modestly with our anticipated increases in both software implementation and consulting revenues

these savings were partially offset by the costs of carretek  our owned business process outsourcer which only has one customer and has not achieved the anticipated economies of scale 
the total cost of revenues was of total revenue in fiscal in fiscal  we expect cost of revenues in absolute dollars to increase slightly  however  the total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues is expected to decline 
the decrease in total cost of revenues in absolute dollars of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of lower personnel and outside independent contractor and consulting costs within the gpc business segment

reve s cost of consulting remained flat in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decline in absolute dollars of million along with the decline in consulting costs as a percentage of consulting revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of a million or decline in the consulting costs within the gpc business segment 
these cost reduction efforts were primarily lower personnel and independent contractor costs in response to less demand for our bank consolidation and staff augmentation services 
cost of software licenses in thousands vs 
vs 
fy fy fy cost of software licenses    of software license revenue the cost of software licenses consists principally of amortization of capitalized and acquired software costs along with royalties payable to third parties 
the cost of software licenses was relatively flat in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in royalty expense  due to a lower volume of software contracts  was offset by increased amortization expense related to our exchglink product offering and the acquired developed technology related to the purchase of an anti money laundering software solution purchased for million in the third quarter of fiscal the increase in absolute dollars of  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily the result of increased royalty expense 
the increase in the cost of software licenses  as a percentage of software license revenue  is primarily the result of a decline in software license revenue experienced in fiscal in connection with software license  maintenance and certain consulting agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to our customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products 
under these arrangements  we recognize royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
the royalty percentages generally range from to of the associated revenue 
approximately million  million and million of royalty expense was recorded under these agreements and charged to cost of software licenses in the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
depending on our future product mix  our margins from software license fees may be negatively impacted by increased software royalty expense 
write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties during the quarterly period ended january   in connection with our periodic impairment review of our portfolio of software products  the eimanager product acquired in the ais business combination in january was deemed to be impaired 
based on the company s calculation of the expected future cash flows of the product  a  non cash charge was recorded 
effective june  we entered into a software license agreement with actuate corporation in which the company would integrate actuate corporation s software with our global tracking and cash solutions within the global payments technologies business segment 
we prepaid  for copies of the software 
based on the expected sales forecasts of this product a  non cash charge was recorded in the quarterly period ended january  these costs are summarized below in thousands write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties year ended january  capitalized eimanager product costs write off of prepaid software royalties with actuate corporation 
total recorded in the year ended january  in fiscal  we do not expect any additional impairments of capitalized software or prepaid software royalties 
however  if market conditions deteriorate or demand for software solutions in which we have capitalized software  or acquired developed technology is not what we expected  these assets may become impaired and subject to a charge to earnings

fy fy fy cost of software maintenance     of software maintenance revenue cost of maintenance consists primarily of personnel and facility costs to provide telephone support  product defect support and other enhancements to our existing products which are not significant enough to extend the product s life cycle  or substantially increase its marketability 
these costs are primarily contained within our gpt business segment 
the increase in costs of maintenance in absolute dollars of million and million in fiscal and is the result of traditional research and development employees working on software maintenance projects that integrated and enhanced our legacy products in preparation for new technology and new product offerings 
the annual maintenance fee is generally paid by the customer at the beginning of the maintenance period and we recognize this maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the related contract 
if the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning of the maintenance period  we defer revenue recognition until the time that the maintenance fee is paid by the customer 
when the payment is received  maintenance revenue is recognized for the period that maintenance revenue was previously deferred 
as a result  our cost of software maintenance as a percentage of related maintenance revenue will also fluctuate

the decline in costs of software implementation in absolute dollars of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily driven by a million  or  decline in these costs within the gpt business segment and a million decline within the cve software group contained in the reve business segment 
in both cases  the decline in these costs was the result of a reduction in new software license and implementation projects contracted in fiscal the decline in costs is mostly attributable to a reduction in personnel who were either terminated or reassigned within the company 
the decline in costs of software implementation in absolute dollars of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily driven by a million decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the decline in new software license and implementation projects contracted and also the completion of an implementation project at the federal reserve

these costs are invoiced to the customer  without mark up  usually on a monthly basis 
certain customer contracts do contain expense maximums  so in certain cases not all expenses incurred can be passed along to the customer 
the declines in these costs for both fiscal and fiscal are primarily the result of the decline in new consulting projects contracted for within the gpc business segment and the decline in new implementation projects contracted for within the gpt business segment

additionally  the provision for doubtful accounts  insurance  including directors and officers insurance  as well as professional services  such as legal and accounting expenses  and other related costs are classified within selling  general and administrative expense 
the fiscal selling  general and administrative costs declined million  as compared to fiscal  as we lowered our expense base to better align our cost structure with our current revenue levels 
in fiscal  we expanded our sales capacity in all three business segments and sales costs increased approximately million 
these increased sales costs were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses of million achieved through operating efficiencies and consolidation efforts 
some of the major declines were personnel and contract labor reductions of million  office service and facilities reductions of million and better accounts receivable management which reduced our bad debt charges by  these general and administrative savings were partially offset by  of professional services related to increased accounting and third party consulting fees for sarbanes oxley compliance 
even with the decreased expense levels  the selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  increased in fiscal to  from  due to the decline in total revenue 
the fiscal selling  general and administrative costs remained relatively flat  as compared to fiscal the increase in the selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  was primarily the result of the decrease in total revenue from fiscal  as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we expect to continue to increase our selling expenses  however  we anticipate that any increases in selling expenses should be balanced with planned continued decreases within our general and administrative areas to maintain overall selling  general and administrative costs at a level that is expected to be consistent with fiscal levels  exclusive of any expenses related to the expensing of stock options

research and development costs are typically limited to development of new software products  or enhancements to existing software products  which extend the product s life cycle and or substantially increase its marketability 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalized million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal and  the majority of our capitalization is related to the development of products needed to address the changing market environment due to the check legislation which went into effect in october these development initiatives consisted of exchglink  an application to send and receive check images  express research  an image enabled back office application  source capture which enables customers to capture check images at corporate sites  bank branches and atm s  an anti money laundering application and other fraud detection products 
software development costs of a product are capitalized from the time technological feasibility is reached until the general release of the product 
we establish technological feasibility through the process of creating a detailed program design and reviewing the detailed program design for any high risk development issues or through the creation of a working model 
capitalization only occurs if we believe costs capitalized are recoverable through future sales of the software product under development 
in fiscal  we expect this volume of development activity to continue and anticipate that research and development expense will be slightly higher on an absolute dollar basis 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in each of fiscal  and the amortization results from the periodic recognition of amortization expense of intangible customer relationships acquired in the check solutions acquisition in fiscal goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual evaluation for goodwill impairment resulting in a charge of million 
the impairment charge was recorded to the global payments technologies gpt segment as all of the company s goodwill has been assigned to the gpt segment 
the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned was determined to be less than its carrying amount 
thus  an allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit was made to determine the excess of fair value over amounts allocated to net assets 
the excess represents the estimated fair value of the goodwill which was compared to recorded goodwill as of the evaluation date of november  and resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the fair values used in this evaluation were estimated based upon the consideration of a number of fair value estimation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis and consideration of the market price of our stock 
the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue volume levels  price levels and rates of increases in operating expenses to compute projected cash flows for the reporting unit and other intangible assets within the reporting unit 
a discount rate of was applied to determine discounted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  we performed our annual evaluation for goodwill impairment 
no impairment resulted from these assessments 
we believe that our assumptions used to estimate future cash flows for these evaluations are reasonable 
however  if market conditions deteriorate or if changes occur in the estimated projections with respect to gpt business  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future  the amount of which could be material to our results of operations

other income expense increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal and increased from  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was the result of the increase in the minority share of the net loss of carretek llc 
additionally in april  we sold our interest in cash services australia pty limited 
the carrying value of our investment was approximately  and we received  in proceeds 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a  gain 
these two increases were offset by foreign exchange losses of approximately  in fiscal  the increase was primarily the result of the  recorded as minority interest in the net loss of carretek llc operations 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate  and includes federal  state and foreign income taxes 
in fiscal  the majority of our tax provision consisted of foreign taxes incurred that could not be offset with us tax benefits 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to net operating losses offsetting the taxable income generated 
the lower tax rate in fiscal was due to losses we incurred from which we have not yet obtained a tax benefit 
for us to realize the benefit of our net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets recorded as of january   we must generate substantial future taxable income 
due to losses incurred in fiscal  fiscal and  we concluded that the more likely than not criteria required for recognition of deferred tax assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas was not met at both january  and thus  a valuation allowance was recorded to fully reserve the net deferred tax assets which resulted in the unbenefitted losses 
on march   the federal tax law changed to allow net operating losses for taxable years ended in and to be carried back an additional three years 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the impact of this change in tax law and related five year carryback was not used in the determination of the company s tax provision and related deferred tax valuation allowance for the year ended january  the impact from this change in tax law  including any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the expanded carryback period  was reflected in our tax provision for the quarterly period ended april  this resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million in fiscal which was partially offset by state and foreign taxes

in the quarterly period ended october   we accrued an approximate  discretionary bonus for our business segments and corporate support groups which had not qualified for a bonus under the carreker incentive bonus plan 
during the quarterly period ended january   operating results were not what had been expected within both the gpt and gpc business segments and therefore approximately  of this bonus was reversed 
the effect of this change in estimate  net of tax  was per share on a diluted basis  for the quarterly period ended january  our quarterly results may vary significantly depending primarily on factors  such as timing of contract execution and revenue recognition  timing of payments  especially maintenance payments  received from our customers  increases in costs beyond anticipated levels  especially in the context of costs incurred under value pricing contracts  or fluctuations in software royalty expense due to a change in future product mix  the timing and degree of customer acceptance of new solutions  fluctuations or delays in schedules for implementation of software licensed to customers  the introduction of new or enhanced solutions by us or our competitors  our mix of revenues derived from consulting and management service fees on the one hand  and software related fees on the other  war  terrorist acts and civil unrest  timing of consolidation decisions by customers 
risks over which we have little or no control  including customer budget cycles and priorities  can significantly affect operating results 
because of the above factors  along with items such as restructuring and other charges  the results of any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for the full year 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and cash expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
at january   we had working capital of million compared to million at january  we had million in cash and cash equivalents at january   an increase of million from million in cash and cash equivalents at january  at january   we did not have any long term debt as compared to million at january  we expect that existing cash and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating cash flows decreased during fiscal primarily as a result of the net loss of million in fiscal  as compared to the net income of million in fiscal the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily reflected our need to pay a million obligation  assumed during the check solutions acquisition in fiscal  to certain former employees of check solutions and other incentive compensation accrued at january   which caused the decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increases in both accounts receivable and income taxes payable were offset by the decline in deferred revenue 
average days sales outstanding fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including the timing of billings specified by contractual agreement  and receivables for expense reimbursements 
the following table contains the quarterly days sales outstanding dso quarter ended dso january  october  july  april  january  cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to million of routine purchases of property and equipment  mainly computer equipment and the replacement of certain developmental hardware and software within our development lab based in charlotte  north carolina  along with million of capitalized software costs 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to million of routine purchases of property and equipment along with million of capitalized software costs and a million purchase of acquired developed software related to an anti money laundering product 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the purchases of property and equipment 
we do not expect significant changes in the purchases of property and equipment in fiscal however  we believe that capitalized software development costs will slightly increase 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the cash used in financing activities in fiscal was comprised of payments on long term debt offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and cash received from the minority shareholder in carretek llc 
the cash used in financing activities in fiscal was comprised of million of payments on our revolving credit agreement offset by million of stock option exercise proceeds 
in addition  we incurred  of deferred loan costs when the revolving credit agreement was amended in july the cash used in financing activities during fiscal was comprised of million of payments on our revolving credit agreement offset by million of stock option proceeds and proceeds from a private placement of our common stock on april  the net proceeds from the private placement of million were used to satisfy obligations due certain employees of check solutions of approximately million with the remainder used for working capital 
on june   we entered into a three year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks in an amount not to exceed million to fund the acquisition of check solutions 
on july   the revolving credit agreement was amended to reduce the commitment amount to million  and to extend the maturity date of the outstanding borrowings to july  at january   we had no outstanding borrowings and at january   we had million outstanding under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement currently bear interest equal to either the greater of prime or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from to depending on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  or london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin equal to to depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
interest payments are due quarterly 
we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to on the unused amount of the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  some of which have been amended  including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified interest coverage  ratio of ebitda to funded debt  and ratio of of accounts receivable  cash and short term investments to funded debt 
additionally  the payment of dividends is precluded subject to the approval of the banks 
substantially all of our assets collateralize this revolving credit agreement 
as of january   we are in compliance with the covenants of the revolving credit agreement  as amended 
at january   we had material commitments for our operating leases  as described in note in our notes to consolidated financial statements  including commitments of approximately million in fiscal the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january  and the effect these contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total year or less years years after years revolving credit agreement operating leases     on april   we sold  shares of our common stock to a group of investors in a private transaction 
we utilized the approximately million of net proceeds that were received from the sale to satisfy existing obligations due to certain former employees of check solutions  with the remainder being used for working capital 
see note in notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current cash balances and expected future cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities during fiscal however  if current sources are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the company is presently involved in a number of lawsuits  including a shareholder class action lawsuit 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the timing of the final resolution of these matters is uncertain 
we believe that a material adverse outcome or outcomes with respect to the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results  our business or our management including but not limited to  significantly impacting our liquidity in a negative manner as well as causing covenant violations under our revolving credit agreement  possibly resulting in a default thereunder 
further  we may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that could complement or expand our business and product offerings  and could change our financing needs 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the failure to secure additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and our estimates may vary from actual results 
we consider the following seven accounting policies the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ  and such differences could be significant to our financial results 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of software  or the license agreement requires us to provide implementation services that are determined to be essential to other elements of the arrangement  we follow the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
consulting fees 
we employ three primary pricing methods in connection with our delivery of consulting services 
first  we may price our delivery of consulting services on the basis of time and materials  in which case the customer is charged agreed upon daily rates for services performed and out of pocket expenses 
in this case  we are generally paid fees and related amounts usually on a monthly basis  and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
second  we may deliver consulting services on a fixed price basis 
in this case  we are generally paid on a monthly basis or pursuant to an agreed upon payment schedule  and we recognize revenues on a proportionate performance basis 
we believe that this method is appropriate because of our ability to determine performance milestones and determine dependable estimates of our costs applicable to each phase of a contract 
because financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses 
anticipated losses on fixed priced contracts are recognized when estimable 
third  we may deliver consulting services pursuant to a value priced contract with the customer 
in this case  we are paid  on an agreed upon basis with the customer  either a specified percentage of the projected increased revenues and or decreased costs that are expected to be derived by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution or the actual increased revenues and or decreased costs experienced by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution  subject in either case to a maximum  if any is agreed to  on the total amount of payments to be made to us 
we must first commit time and resources to develop projections associated with value pricing contracts before a bank will commit to purchase our solutions  and we therefore assume the risk of making these commitments with no assurance that the customer will purchase the solution 
costs associated with these value pricing contracts are expensed as incurred 
these contracts typically include payments to be made to us pursuant to an agreed upon schedule ranging from one to twelve months in length 
we recognize revenues generated from consulting services in connection with value priced contracts based upon projected results only upon completion of all services and agreement upon the actual fee to be paid even though billings for these services may be delayed by mutual agreement for periods not to exceed twelve months 
in an effort to allow customers to more closely match expected benefits from our services with payments to us  we may on occasion  offer payment terms which extend beyond months 
when we enter into an agreement that has a significant component of the total amount payable under the agreement due beyond months or if it is determined payments are not fixed and determinable at the date the agreement is entered into  revenue under the arrangement will be recognized as payments become due and payable 
when fees are to be paid based on a percentage of actual revenues and or savings to our customers  we recognize revenues only upon completion of all services and as the amounts of actual revenues or savings are confirmed by the customer with a fixed payment date 
costs associated with time and materials  fixed priced and value priced consulting fee arrangements are expensed as incurred and are included as a component of the cost of consulting fees 
we expect that value priced contracts will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
as a consequence of the use of value priced contracts and due to the revenue recognition policy associated with those contracts  our results of operations will likely fluctuate significantly from period to period 
regardless of the pricing method employed by us in a given contract  we are typically reimbursed on a monthly basis for out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of our customers 
software license fees 
a software license is sold either together with implementation services or on a stand alone basis 
we are usually paid software license fees in one or more installments  as provided in the customer s contract but not to exceed months 
we recognize software license revenue upon execution of a contract and delivery of the software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and collection is considered probable by management 
when the software license arrangement requires us to provide implementation services that are essential to the functionality of the software or significant production  customization or modification of the software is required  both the product license revenue and implementation fees are recognized as services are performed 
in certain instances  especially with recently developed software  we defer software license revenue recognition until the earlier of the product being determined to be generally available and subject to revenue recognition or when the services are completed and the project is accepted by the customer 
this practice is followed for the first two installations of a recently developed software product 
after two successful implementations  the product is considered generally available ga 
software licenses are often sold as part of a multiple element arrangement that may include maintenance  implementation or consulting 
we determine whether there is vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoefv for each element identified in the arrangement to determine whether the total arrangement fees can be allocated to each element 
if vsoefv exists for each element  the total arrangement fee is allocated based on the relative fair value of each element 
in cases where there is not vsoefv for each element  or if it is determined services are essential to the functionality of the software being delivered  or if significant production  modification or customization of the software is required  we initially defer revenue recognition of the software license fees until vsoefv is established or the services are performed 
however  if vsoefv is determinable for all of the undelivered elements  and assuming the undelivered elements are not essential to the delivered elements  we will defer recognition of the full fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining portion of the arrangement value through application of the residual method 
where vsoefv has not been established for certain undelivered elements  revenue for all elements is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their fair values have been determined 
evidence of vsoefv is determined for software products based on actual sales prices for the product sold to a similar class of customer and based on pricing strategies set forth in our price book 
evidence of vsoefv for services installation  implementation and consulting is based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for individuals expected to perform the related services 
we establish vsoefv for maintenance agreements using the percentage method such that vsoefv for maintenance is a percentage of the license fee charged annually for specific software product  which in most instances is of the portion of arrangement fees allocated to the software license element 
although substantially all of our current software licenses provide for a fixed price license fee  some licenses provide for the customer to pay a monthly license fee based on the actual use of the software product 
the level of license fees earned by us under this arrangement will vary based on the actual amount of use by the customer 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized on a monthly basis as the usage becomes determinable 
software maintenance fees 
in connection with our sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software maintenance services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software maintenance services  which typically are renewed annually 
we charge an annual maintenance fee  which is typically a percentage of the initial software license fee 
the annual maintenance fee generally is paid to us at the beginning of the maintenance period  and we recognize these revenues ratably over the term of the related contract 
if the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning of the maintenance period  we defer revenue recognition until the time that the maintenance fee is paid by the customer 
we normally continue to provide maintenance service while awaiting payment from customers 
when the payment is received  revenue is recognized for the period that revenue was previously deferred 
this may result in volatility in software maintenance revenue from period to period 
software implementation fees 
in connection with the sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software implementation services  including software enhancements and other software services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software implementation services 
we price our implementation services on a time and material or on a fixed price basis  and we recognize the related revenues as services are performed 
costs associated with these engagements are expensed as incurred 
outsourcing services fees 
while outsourcing revenue has been minimal to date  we currently recognize revenue based on the number of items processed multiplied by the contracted price per item 
these services are currently billed on a monthly basis 
our contracts typically do not include right of return clauses  and as a result  we do not record a provision for returns 
royalties in connection with software license and maintenance agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to its customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products 
under these arrangements  we accrue royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
for current product offerings  the royalty percentages generally range from of the associated revenues 
royalty expense is included as a component of the cost of software license fees and cost of software maintenance fees in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts a large proportion of our revenues and receivables are attributable to our customers in the banking industry 
our trade accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of receivables 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us or if the collection of the receivable becomes doubtful due to a dispute that arises subsequent to the delivery of our products and services  we set up a specific reserve in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
software costs capitalized  acquired developed technology  goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets software costs capitalized include developed technology acquired in acquisitions and costs incurred by us in developing our products that qualify for capitalization 
we capitalize our software development costs  other than costs for internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
our policy is to capitalize software development costs incurred in developing a product once technological feasibility of the product has been established 
software development costs capitalized also include amounts paid for purchased software on products that have reached technological feasibility 
technological feasibility of the product is determined after completion of a detailed program design and a determination has been made that any uncertainties related to high risk development issues have been resolved 
if the process of developing the product does not include a detailed program design  technological feasibility is determined only after completion of a working model 
all capitalized software development costs are amortized using an amount determined as the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a capitalized software project bears to the total of current and future projected gross revenues for that project or the straight line method over the estimated remaining economic life of the product generally three to six years 
we continually monitor the net realizable value of the software capitalized and acquired developed technology for factors that would indicate impairment  such as a decline in the demand or loss of a significant customer 
during the quarterly period ended january   we performed our annual formal evaluation for impairment and determined that the carrying amount of these assets were not impaired and have noted no subsequent factors that would indicate impairment 
goodwill is assessed on an annual basis for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
we performed the initial impairment test of goodwill at february  and a follow up test at november  to determine if an impairment charge should be recognized under sfas the initial impairment analysis did not result in any write down of capitalized costs 
we perform an annual impairment assessment on november st of each year or when factors indicate that other long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows over the remaining life of the asset to determine if impairment has occurred 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent from other asset groups 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is assessed when the undiscounted  expected future operating cash flows derived from the asset are less than its carrying value 
management believes that assumptions used to determine cash flows are reasonable  but actual future cash flows may differ from those estimated 
if we determine an asset has been impaired  the impairment is recorded based on the estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
during the period ended january   we recorded an impairment charge of million due to a decline in our market valuation 
during the quarterly period ended january   we performed our annual evaluation for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired and have not noted any factors subsequent that would indicate impairment 
goodwill at january  totaled million 
any deterioration in market conditions  increases in interest rates and changes in our projections with respect to the global payments technologies reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated would result in additional impairment charges in the future 
restructuring and other charges during fiscal year  we recorded reserves in connection with our acquisition of check solutions and subsequent operational restructurings 
additional reserves were recorded during fiscal  and these reserves contain significant estimates pertaining to work force reductions  and the settlement of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
in the quarterly period ended july   we revised our estimate to reflect our remaining costs to develop and install any additional software  or software modifications  with two customers and reversed approximately million of our reserve  and in the quarterly period ended january  revised this estimate again and reversed  although we do not anticipate any significant changes in the future  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments of outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount or reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in insurance coverage or approach such as change in settlement strategy 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of our cumulative net losses we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance of any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
recently issued accounting standards see recently issued accounting standards in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments 
the vast majority of these investments are denominated in us dollars and maintained with nationally recognized financial institutions 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading 
at january   we did not hold any fixed rate investments 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement at january  as described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is variable 
foreign currency risk we currently have sales and marketing operations in several international locations including canada  united kingdom  south africa and australia 
as a result  we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to the nature of these operations  we currently utilize the us dollar as the functional currency for all international operations 
an insignificant portion of our accounts receivable balance at january   was denominated in a foreign currency 
our exposure to adverse movements in foreign exchange rates is typically not significant 
therefore  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure  however  we do try to limit our foreign currency exposure by negotiating these foreign contracts in us dollars 
however  in the future we may change this practice 
we will continue to evaluate the need to adopt a hedge strategy in the future and may implement a formal strategy if our business transacted in foreign currencies increases 
foreign exchange losses were  in the year ended january  foreign exchange gains were  and  in the years ended january  and  respectively
