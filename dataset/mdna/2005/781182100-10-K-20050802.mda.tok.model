item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview ruby tuesday  inc rti  the company  we and or our owns and operates ruby tuesday casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday concept in selected domestic and international markets 
as of fiscal year end  we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants  located in states and the district of columbia 
we also own or of the equity of each of domestic franchisees  with the balance of the equity in these franchisees being owned by the various operators of the franchise businesses 
as of year end  these franchisees  which we refer to as franchise partnerships  operated restaurants 
our other franchisees  domestic and international  operated restaurants 
rti s franchisees operate restaurants in states and puerto rico and foreign countries 
casual dining  the segment of the restaurant industry in which rti operates  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  locations and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer the same or similar types of services and products as we do 
our industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local conditions  demographic trends  traffic patterns  and the types  numbers and locations of competing restaurants as well as overall marketing efforts 
there also is significant competition in the restaurant industry for management personnel and for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
our historical results have been achieved by using a blend of factors  including the following providing casual food in a fun atmosphere for a reasonable price  being operationally focused  opening profitable units  providing real time information and analysis to restaurant management teams  leveraging brand and support services through franchising  and quickly responding to new opportunities 
our performance goals focus on measurements we believe are key to our growth and progress including  but not limited to  same store sales  new unit openings  and margins 
our performance in these areas is discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a section 
we remind you that  in order to best obtain an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we also remind you that on april   rti filed a form k a which amended our previously filed form k for fiscal contained within that form k a were restated consolidated financial statements for fiscal years through the restatements resulted from lease accounting matters  including adjustments relating to lease term  amortization of leasehold improvements  rent holidays  subleases and landlord tenant incentives 
amounts reflected herein were derived from the restated financial information rather than the prior year form k which had been filed with the sec on july  and mailed to shareholders shortly thereafter 
similarly  on may   rti filed forms q a amending the previously filed first and second quarter of fiscal consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenues are not included in  and are not  revenues of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income and equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information which we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
results of operations sales sales at ruby tuesday restaurants in fiscal grew over fiscal for company owned restaurants and declined for domestic and international franchise restaurants as explained below 
the tables presented below reflect ruby tuesday concept sales for the last five years  and other revenue information for the last three years 
ruby tuesday concept sales in millions fiscal year company owned a franchise a  b a during fiscal  previously franchised ruby tuesday restaurants were acquired by the company from franchisees 
b includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
other revenue information company restaurant sales company restaurant sales growth percentage franchise revenue a franchise revenue growth percentage total revenue total revenue growth percentage a franchise revenue includes royalty  license and development fees paid to us by our franchisees  exclusive of support service fees of million  million  and million  in fiscal years  and  respectively  which are recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in franchise revenue in fiscal is due in part to the acquisition of previously franchised ruby tuesday restaurants by the company as noted above 
rti s increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to growth in the number of restaurants offset with a decrease in same store sales and lower average unit volumes 
during the year  we opened a net of restaurants and acquired units from franchisees 
same store sales for company owned units decreased in fiscal management attributes the decrease in same store sales to a combination of factors  the largest of which was the company s decision  at the beginning of fiscal s second quarter  to move away from couponing as its primary means of driving trial and traffic towards media advertising 
coupon redemptions totaled million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal while we believe there were other operational and external factors contributing to the company s poor same store sales performance for the year  we have remained focused on reversing the negative trend in same store sales by implementing changes to our menu  improving store level operations  working to differentiate ourselves from our competitors  and beginning to utilize media advertising in an effort to return to positive same store sales growth 
rti s increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to growth in the number of restaurants coupled with same store sales growth and higher average unit volumes 
same store sales for company owned units increased in fiscal franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties generally of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue decreased to million in fiscal but increased to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is due in part to the acquisition of four franchise partnership entities which combined owned ruby tuesday restaurants at the times of purchase 
same store sales at domestic franchise restaurants including franchise partnership and traditional franchise restaurants decreased in fiscal total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
rti franchise sales increased in fiscal due to growth in the number of restaurants and an increase in average unit volumes 
same store sales at domestic franchise restaurants including franchise partnership and traditional franchise restaurants increased in fiscal due to increased franchise participation in sales building activities 
franchise restaurant sales a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
rti franchise sales decreased in fiscal as discussed above  the decrease is due in part to the acquisition of four franchise partnership entities and a decrease in average unit volumes as a result of a decrease in same store sales for domestic franchise restaurants 
ruby tuesday restaurants the table below presents the number of ruby tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal through fiscal fiscal year company owned franchise total overview during fiscal  we opened company owned ruby tuesday restaurants  acquired ruby tuesday restaurants as part of the acquisitions of four franchise partnership entities  and closed the following restaurants five due to lease terminations  and one near lease termination as part of an upgrade in the market 
during fiscal  we opened ruby tuesday restaurants  and closed six ruby tuesday restaurants due to lease terminations 
our franchisees entered into development agreements with us whereby they committed to open a specified number of ruby tuesday restaurants in their assigned territories over a specific period of time 
pursuant to development agreements  ruby tuesday franchise restaurants franchise partnership and ten traditional were opened during fiscal and ruby tuesday franchise restaurants franchise partnership and traditional were opened during fiscal in addition to the ruby tuesday restaurants sold to the company in fiscal  rti s franchisees closed nine restaurants six franchise partnership and three traditional during fiscal and five restaurants two franchise partnership and three traditional during fiscal impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r or the statement 
fas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
fas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
fas r specifies that the fair value of an employee stock option be based on an observable market price of an option with the same or similar terms and conditions if one is available 
since rti s employees stock options are not currently traded  there is no observable market price  and fas r thus requires that the fair value be estimated using a valuation technique that is applied in a manner consistent with the fair value measurement objective and the other requirements of the statement  is based on established principles of financial economic theory and generally applied in that field  and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instrument 
fas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
the statement is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  fiscal for rti 
as of the effective date  rti expects to apply the statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and for awards modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for either recognition or pro forma disclosures under fas for periods before the required effective date  entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application transition method under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by fas the amount of compensation expense associated with stock options anticipated being unvested as of the date of required adoption but already issued as of the date of this filing is million 
of this amount  and assuming no forfeitures  million is expected to be recognized in fiscal the remainder will be recognized between fiscal and fiscal the impact of this statement on rti in fiscal and beyond will depend upon various factors  including  but not limited to  our future compensation strategy 
as of the date of this filing  the company expects that it will modify certain of its compensation plans to limit eligibility to receive share based compensation  modify future grants to include performance or market conditions which should lower the fair value of future grants to levels below those of prior grants  and shift a portion of the share based compensation to cash based incentive compensation 
in fiscal  the company reduced the number of stock options granted from prior years 
the company plans to prospectively grant only to million shares 
the pro forma compensation costs presented in the table shown in note to our consolidated financial statements and in our prior filings have been calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of amounts which should be expected in future years due to possible changes in the valuation methodology used to determine the expense of the option  the addition of performance or market conditions to the options awarded  reductions in the number of options awarded  and the resumption of to month vesting on option grants 
as of the date of this filing  no decisions have been made as to which option pricing model is most appropriate for rti 
operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 
all information is derived from our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report 
restaurant sales and operating revenue franchise revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue selling  general and administrative  net of support service fees equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises interest expense  net total operating costs and expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income pre tax income for fiscal  pre tax profit was million or of total revenue  as compared to million or of total revenue  for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to lower average unit volumes driven by a decrease of in same store sales at company owned restaurants  increased advertising costs and lower franchising revenues 
in addition  the decrease is due to increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  depreciation and amortization  and decreased income from our equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises as discussed below 
these higher costs were offset by the growth in the number of units and lower  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs 
pre tax income increased million in fiscal to million as compared to fiscal the reported increase was due to growth in the number of units  higher average unit volumes  increased franchising revenues  and a reduction  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  of cost of merchandise and payroll and related costs as discussed below 
cost of merchandise cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in portion sizes for certain items as well as a shift to a new product for items such as chicken breasts  chicken tenders and wings  ribs and mashed potatoes  and the addition of new menu items  such as stackers and coconut shrimp  in the current year 
this increase was partially offset by a benefit gained by purchasing bulk produce versus local produce and by the impact of decreased coupon redemptions 
cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  decreased in fiscal primarily due to declining food costs with the roll out of a new menu in march additionally  the decrease in fiscal was attributable to the roll out of our new ruby tuesday s smart eating menu  which featured lower food cost  but higher percentage gross margin  items such as wraps 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue in fiscal due to labor cost efficiencies resulting from improved tracking of hourly employees which allowed for more efficient staffing  and new product additions that further reduced preparation times 
in addition  the decrease is attributed to reduced coupon redemptions in the current fiscal year  which were million lower than the prior fiscal year and favorable health claims experience 
for fiscal  payroll and related costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  due to the prior year investment in training for our new service initiatives and a focus in fiscal on decreasing hourly labor during operating periods outside of lunch and dinner shifts 
the decrease is also attributable to labor efficiencies resulting from the march new menu and savings associated with the utilization of more pre cut produce  which decreased the amount of preparation time required for various menu items 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  including electricity and natural gas  higher rent and lease required expenses driven by lower average unit volumes coupled with the addition of the four franchise partnership entities during the year  higher closing expense due to a favorable lease adjustment in the prior fiscal year  and a loss recorded on our guarantee of the rt northern california revolving credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
additionally  the costs  many of which are somewhat fixed in nature  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased due to the loss of leverage resulting from lower same store sales 
these increases were partially offset by a million gain resulting from the sale of our interest in rt northern illinois to rt midwest  a traditional franchise  during the second quarter of fiscal for fiscal  other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  was consistent with fiscal primarily due to lower rent expense  which was a result of a focus on opening units in which we own the land and building as opposed to leased units  and general liability insurance expense  due to favorable claims experience 
the lower rent expense was offset by an increase in repairs  as we committed additional funds in fiscal to maintain or improve the overall appearance of our units 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to lower average unit volumes  and accelerated depreciation on seven units expected to be closed at the end of their lease terms 
two of the seven units with accelerated depreciation closed during fiscal for fiscal  depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased as the refinancing of million of bank financed operating leases in fiscal was only partially offset by average unit volume increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher advertising expenditures as we transition towards television advertising as our primary form of marketing with less emphasis on the use of coupons which are recorded as a reduction of restaurant revenues and a reduction in franchise support service fee income due to the purchase of four franchise partnership entities during the current year and lower same store sales for the franchise partnerships  offset by a decrease in bonus expense to adjust for lower bonuses 
the transition towards television advertising began during the second quarter of fiscal advertising costs increased million in fiscal to million  net of franchise marketing reimbursements 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase is attributable to an increase in marketing and public relations costs related to the to go and ruby tuesday smart eating campaigns  increased management labor due to the addition of new directors of people  standards and results  or dpsr s  our multi unit operators  in order to reduce the span of control for each dpsr  increased advertising costs for the production of television commercials used for media testing during the first quarter of fiscal  and higher collateral production costs due to the roll out of the new menu as well as new plastic menu covers 
these increases were offset by higher support service fees from franchises and specialty restaurant group  llc srg 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchises decreased to million from million in fiscal  due to the acquisition of the rt tampa franchise  a owned franchise  coupled with the sale of our ownership interest in rt northern illinois and lower same store sales for certain of our owned franchise partnerships during the year 
for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchises increased to million from million in fiscal  due to increased earnings attributable to the owned franchise partnerships coupled with the earnings attributable to four partnerships in which we acquired an additional equity interest in fiscal our agreements with franchise partnerships allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for million 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than that which we expect when we invest in new restaurants 
during fiscal  we did not exercise our right to acquire an additional equity interest in any franchise partnerships whereas in fiscal  we exercised our right to acquire an additional equity interest in four franchise partnerships bringing our total ownership in each of these franchisees to 
as of the end of fiscal  we held equity investments in each of franchise partnerships which collectively operate ruby tuesday restaurants 
we have a ownership  with an option to acquire an additional  in seven other franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants at may  as of the end of fiscal  we held equity investments in each of franchise partnerships which then collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants and equity investments in franchise partnerships which then collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants 
net interest expense net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to lower interest income on the franchise partnership notes receivable due to the acquisition of franchise entities during the year coupled with collections on the notes remaining 
for fiscal  net interest expense increased million to million primarily due to lower interest income on the franchise partnership notes receivable which were a part of the purchase price paid by certain franchise partnerships in refranchising transactions 
we collected million net on these notes during fiscal and forgave certain of the notes late in fiscal  both of which contributed to the year over year decrease in interest income 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was  down from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily due to lower pre tax income  which resulted in our tax credits having a greater impact on the overall tax rate 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was  up from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily due to an increase in state taxes during fiscal liquidity and capital resources rti s cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity allow us to pursue our growth strategies and targeted capital structure 
accordingly  we have established certain well defined priorities for our operating cash flow invest wisely in new assets and maintain our commitment to high return  low risk growth to increase profitability  continue to make investments in our team members and our existing assets in order to provide superior guest and team satisfaction  and repurchase our common stock in order to maintain our target capital structure and return excess capital to our shareholders and provide further capital return to our shareholders through our dividend program  started in fiscal sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
principal uses of cash are capital expenditures  share repurchases  payments on debt  and payments of dividends 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and short term investments we require capital principally for new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  and remodeling of existing restaurants 
property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with internally generated cash flows for fiscal were million 
during fiscal we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire  directly and through our subsidiaries  the remaining member or limited partnership interests of rt new york  the upstate new york buffalo area franchisee  rt tampa  rt northern california  and rt michiana  the southwest michigan and northern indiana franchisee 
these acquisitions added units to the company 
further acquisitions  particularly from franchisees in the eastern united states  may occur either during fiscal or thereafter 
capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be approximately to million based on our expectation that we will open approximately company owned units in fiscal also included are budgeted amounts for ongoing refurbishment and capital replacement for existing restaurants  the roll out of our kitchen display system  and the enhancement of information systems

during fiscal  we expect to fund operations  capital expansion  any repurchase of common stock or franchise partnership equity  and the payment of dividends from operating cash flows  our credit facility  and operating leases 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
off balance sheet arrangements since  our franchise partnerships have been offered a credit facility for which we provide a partial guarantee 
the current credit facility  which has been negotiated with various lenders  is a million credit facility to assist franchise partnerships with working capital and operational cash flow requirements 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on november  we amended and restated this credit facility with various lenders 
as sponsor of the credit facility  we serve as partial guarantor of the draws made on this revolving line of credit 
the credit facility expires on october  and allows for month individual franchise partnership loan commitments 
if desired  rti can increase the amount of the facility by up to million to a total of million or  reduce the amount of the facility 
the amount guaranteed under this program totaled million as of may  as discussed in the management s outlook section of this md a which follows  it is our goal to reduce the amounts guaranteed under this facility between now and the time of expiration of the program 
prior to july   rti also had an arrangement with a different third party lender whereby we could choose  in our sole discretion  to partially guarantee specific loans for new franchisee restaurant development the cancelled facility 
on july   rti terminated the cancelled facility and notified this third party lender that it would no longer enter into additional guarantee arrangements 
rti will honor the partial guarantees of the three loans to franchise partnerships that were in existence as of the termination of the credit facility 
should payments be required under the cancelled facility  rti has certain rights to acquire the operating restaurants after the third party debt is paid 
this program had remaining outstanding guarantees of million at may  also in july  rti entered into a new program  similar to the cancelled facility  with a different third party lender the franchise development facility 
under the franchise development facility  the company s potential guarantee liability is reduced  and the program includes better terms and lower rates for the franchise partnerships as compared to the cancelled facility 
rti has a guarantee of million outstanding under this program as of may  as consideration for providing these guarantees  we received million in fiscal as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted below  rti has certain divestiture guarantees with morrison fresh cooking  inc mfc and morrison health care  inc 
mhc which arose in in connection with the distribution of mfc subsequently acquired by piccadilly cafeterias  inc  or piccadilly and mhc subsequently acquired by compass group  plc  or compass businesses 
contingent liabilities resulting from these guarantees include payments due to mfc and mhc employees retiring under two non qualified defined benefit plans which existed at the time of the distribution the non qualified pension plans  or corresponding replacement plans established by mfc and mhc at the time of distribution  for their proportionate share of any accrued benefit that may have been earned under the non qualified pension plans as of the distribution date and for payments due on eight named workers compensation and general liability claims 
additionally  as a sponsor of the morrison restaurants inc retirement plan the retirement plan  we  along with mfc and mhc  can be held responsible for benefits due to all of the retirement plan s participants 
as a result of the piccadilly bankruptcy discussed herein  the amounts we expect to pay represent of the total amounts due as we expect to share liabilities equally with mhc  which is also contingently liable 
at may   we have recorded liabilities totaling million relative to our estimated share of the mfc benefit plan liabilities 
this amount reflects payments made during fiscal and the receipt  in december  of million in partial settlement of the piccadilly bankruptcy 
the actual amount we may be ultimately required to pay could be lower if there is any further recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding  or could be higher if more valid participants are identified or if actuarial assumptions are ultimately proven inaccurate 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
our contingent liability relative to mhc is estimated to be million at may   and includes mhc s share of the million employee benefit plan liability  along with the amounts for which we would be liable relative to the employees of mhc 
we currently do not anticipate having to pay any amounts on behalf of mhc due to our perception of mhc s financial strength and accordingly no amounts have been recorded relative to our mhc contingent liability 
we have an employment agreement with samuel e 
beall  iii  whereby he has agreed to serve as chief executive officer of the company until june  in accordance with the agreement  mr 
beall is compensated at a base salary adjusted annually based on various company or market factors and is entitled to an annual bonus opportunity and a long term incentive compensation program  which currently includes stock option grants and life insurance coverage 
the employment agreement also provides for certain severance payments to be made in the event of a termination other than for cause  or a change in control  the circumstances of which are defined in the agreement 
as of may   the total of the potential liability for severance payments with regard to the employment agreement was approximately million 
significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of may  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years notes payable and other long term debt  including current maturities a revolving credit facility a unsecured senior notes series a and b a operating leases  net of sublease payments b capital leases a purchase obligations c pension obligations d total a see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
c the amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for food items and supplies  construction projects  and other miscellaneous commitments 
d see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
for purposes of calculating total debt to capital  we include as debt all of the above on balance sheet debt  plus the present value of operating leases  letters of credit  and franchisee loan guarantees 
commercial commitments in thousands total at may  letters of credit a franchisee loan guarantees a divestiture guarantees a includes a million letter of credit which secures a franchisee s borrowings for construction of a restaurant being financed under a franchise loan facility 
draws for construction to date as of may  totaled million 
because the entire million letter of credit is included in the above totals  the million actual franchise loan guarantee as of may  has been excluded from the million presented above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of may  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
pension plans funded status rti is a sponsor of the retirement plan along with mfc and mhc  which were spun off as a result of the fiscal spin off transaction 
the retirement plan was established to provide retirement benefits to qualifying employees of morrison restaurants inc under the retirement plan  participants are entitled to receive benefits based upon salary and length of service 
the retirement plan was amended as of december   so that no additional benefits will accrue and no new participants will enter the retirement plan after that date 
certain responsibilities involving the sponsorship of the retirement plan  until recently  were jointly shared by each of the three companies 
subsequent to the piccadilly bankruptcy  we have shared such responsibilities with compass 
as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  piccadilly announced on october  that it had filed for chapter protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
on march   piccadilly s assets and ongoing business operations were sold to a third party for million 
on march   rti filed a claim against piccadilly as part of the bankruptcy proceedings in the amount of approximately million 
subsequently  the company entered into a settlement agreement under which rti agreed to accept a million unsecured claim in exchange for the creditors committee agreement to allow such claims 
the settlement was approved by the court on october  in partial settlement of the piccadilly bankruptcy  rti received million during the third quarter of fiscal the company hopes to recover an additional amount upon final settlement of the bankruptcy 
the amount of such final recovery is unknown at this time  and no further recovery has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
the retirement plan s original three sponsors had agreed to voluntarily contribute such amounts as are necessary to provide assets sufficient to meet benefits to be paid to participants 
piccadilly  however  has not contributed to the retirement plan subsequent to its bankruptcy filing 
amounts payable to the retirement plan by piccadilly since that date have been split equally between rti and compass 
as of may   we have recorded a liability of million representing rti s share of piccadilly s retirement plan liability 
our total contributions to the retirement plan approximated million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
rti contributions to the retirement plan for fiscal are projected to be million 
to the best of our knowledge  compass has made all required contributions 
rti also sponsors two additional pension plans  the executive supplemental pension plan and the management retirement plan 
although these plans are legally considered to be unfunded  the company does provide a source for the payment of benefits under these two plans in the form of company owned life insurance policies 
the cash value of these policies was million at may  the management retirement plan was amended effective june  such that no additional benefits would accrue and no new participants may enter the plan after that date 
mfc established successor pension plans at the time of its spinoff from rti march for the benefit of eligible rti employees whose employment was being transferred to mfc 
we also expect to have some liability to the mfc employees who had an accrued benefit under the rti unfunded pension plans at the time of the spin off 
based on estimates prepared with the assistance of our independent actuaries  we have recorded a liability of million on behalf of mfc participants relative to these plans 
as with the retirement plan  the extent of any recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding is unknown at this time 
as of our march  measurement date  rti pension plans had a total projected benefit obligation pbo of million  and an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million 
the combined fair value of plan assets as of the end of fiscal  including the company owned life insurance policies and a contribution of million made to the retirement plan after the measurement date but before may   was million 
as a result of the underfunded status of the three plans relative to the combined pbo  we have recorded an million charge to shareholders equity net of tax of million as of may  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time period over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at march  and at march  we believe our assumption of the expected rate of return on plan assets to be appropriate given the composition of plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
we will continue to use the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in fiscal assuming no further recoveries from the piccadilly bankruptcy  we expect pension expense to increase by less than million in fiscal we do not believe that the underfunded status of the three rti pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in fiscal or in future years 
given current funding levels and discount rates  we anticipate making contributions to more fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five to ten years 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the three plans 
we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our annual budgets and outlook 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to rti s shareholders 
this policy calls for payment of semi annual dividends of per share 
in accordance with this policy  we paid dividends of million in fiscal the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
additionally  our credit facilities contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets each quarter we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected terminal value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
restaurants open for less than five quarters are considered new and are excluded from our impairment review 
we believe this approach provides sufficient time to establish the presence of the restaurant in the market and build a customer base 
approximately of our restaurants have been open for less than five quarters and have not been evaluated for potential impairment 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least five quarters shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
the amount of impairment loss recognized is based on the difference between discounted projected cash flows in the case of some negative cash flow restaurants only salvage value is used and the current net book value 
prior to the second quarter of this fiscal year  we had not had more than eight open units with rolling month negative cash flows during the previous year 
quarterly same store sales changes during that same period of time ranged from negative to positive 
despite the fall of same store sales during the second  third  and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year to   and  respectively  at may  we had just eleven restaurants with rolling month negative cash flows 
of these eleven units  only three have consistently had an annual negative cash flow amount in excess of  we recorded impairments on two of these three units during fiscal the third restaurant has been trending towards positive cash flow and  in the opinion of management  is operating well 
we reviewed the plans to reverse negative cash flows at each of the other eight units with negative cash flows for the months ended may  and concluded that no impairment existed 
the combined month cash flow loss at the other eight units was approximately million 
should sales at these eight and other units not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful notes and interest income we follow a systematic methodology each quarter in our analysis of franchise and other notes receivable in order to estimate losses inherent at the balance sheet date 
a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio involves reviewing the following for each significant borrower terms including interest rate  original note date  payoff date  and principal and interest start dates  note amounts including the original balance  current balance  associated debt guarantees  and total exposure  and other relevant information including whether the borrower is making timely interest  principal  royalty and support payments  the borrower s debt coverage ratios  the borrower s current financial condition and sales trends  the borrower s additional borrowing capacity  and  as appropriate  management s judgment on the quality of the borrower s operations 
based on the results of this analysis  the allowance for doubtful notes is adjusted as appropriate 
no portion of the allowance for doubtful notes is allocated to guarantees 
in the event that collection is deemed to be an issue  a number of actions to resolve the issue are possible  including the purchase of the franchised restaurants by us or a replacement franchisee  modification to the terms of payment of franchise fees or note obligations  or a restructuring of the borrower s debt to better position the borrower to fulfill its obligations 
at may  the allowance for doubtful notes was million  of which million was assigned to notes not franchise related 
included in the allowance for doubtful notes is million allocated to the million of debt due from two franchisees believed to be currently below the required coverage ratios with certain of their third party debt 
with the exception of amounts borrowed under the million credit facility for franchise partnerships see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information  the debt referred to above is not guaranteed by rti 
the company believes that payments are being made by these franchisees in accordance with the terms of these debts and no actions have been proposed by the third party lenders at this time 
we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise notes have  since the inception of these notes  allowed for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
with one exception  all franchisees that issued outstanding notes to us are currently paying interest on these notes 
it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the same analysis noted above for doubtful notes is utilized in determining whether to cease recognizing interest income and thereafter record interest payments on the cash basis 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
as of may   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future tax deductions attributable to our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability 
known events  uncertainties and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt we believe to to be prudent  including operating leases  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility and the equivalent of an investment grade bond rating 
this strategy allows us to repurchase rti common stock at times when cash flow exceeds capital expenditures and other funding requirements 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of rti common stock for a total purchase price of million 
in addition  at the march  meeting of the company s board of directors  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of company common stock  thereby bringing the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased as of may  to million 
to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises  additional repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings on the credit facility 
franchising and development agreements as of may   rti held a equity interest in each of eleven franchise partnerships  which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants  and a equity interest  with an option to acquire either an additional or all remaining equity interests  in each of the seven other franchise partnerships  which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants 
we may choose to exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in franchise partnerships in fiscal and beyond 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
fiscal year rti s fiscal will contain weeks and end on june  fiscal years through each contained weeks 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  real estate and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
management s outlook we continue to strategically position the company for growth through the continuing emphasis on our ruby tuesday brand and our franchise programs 
our mission is to be chosen more often 
our business is based on what we call the four p s people  product  price and place 
by remaining intently focused on these four p s  we believe we will be able to accomplish our mission 
our strategies are strengthen the relationship with the dining out public and make ruby tuesday more a part of their lives so that more guests visit us more often  be the custodian of capital  get more out of existing assets and invest wisely in new assets  create a fun trip for all our managers and team members so they are engaged  excited  and committed to our customers and the company  which should create loyal guests  strengthen our brand so it has more appeal and so the dining out public is more aware of it  and achieve consistent and predictable results that create shareholder value 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we will be completing our transition from heavy reliance on couponing to a marketing strategy based on media advertising as the primary means to increase awareness and drive trial 
we remain focused on unit level execution  investing in our team members  evolving our menu and now our media advertising as the means of driving the future success of ruby tuesday 
our current expectations are to increase the company media advertising level of spending by million in fiscal in the franchising area  as part of our longer term plan to increase our company owned growth in the eastern united states  we anticipate continuing to explore the benefits of acquiring some of our franchisees in that area as well as selected additional areas 
we continue to look for potential new  primarily traditional  franchisees in targeted areas in the united states and around the world 
as rti s franchise system continues to shift towards traditional franchise arrangements  we expect that the level of financial support to be provided through programs such as the million franchise partner credit facility will be reduced

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or libor plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin for the libor based option is a percentage ranging from to 
as of may   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our floating rate debt  at certain times we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agreed to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we received a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
we did not engage in interest rate swap agreements during fiscal  nor did we have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of the end of fiscal many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
