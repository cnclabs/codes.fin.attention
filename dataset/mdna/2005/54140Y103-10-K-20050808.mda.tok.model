competition we have targeted our products at distribution intensive supply chain markets within the application software market  which is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain  as well as the enterprise application market as a whole 
these include  but are not limited to  such vendors as  i technologies  jda software  manugistics  and red prairie 
in addition  we face potential competition from large enterprise resource planning erp application software vendors such as sap and oracle  which recently acquired peoplesoft jd edwards and retek  each of which offers sophisticated erp solutions 
table of contents that currently  or may in the future  incorporate supply chain management modules  advanced planning and scheduling  warehouse management  transportation or collaboration software  other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing  or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain management software  and internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments 
we also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for collaborative commerce and supply chain management software and new products and technologies are introduced 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
increased competition could result in fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality  domain expertise  integration technologies  product suite integration  breadth of products and related services such as customer support  training and implementation services 
other factors important to customers and prospects include customer service and satisfaction  ability to provide relevant customer references  compliance with industry specific requirements and standards  flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements  ability to generate business benefits  rapid payback and measurable return on investment  vendor financial stability and company as well as product reputation  and initial license price  cost to implement and long term total cost of ownership 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence  longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices  payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
in order to be successful in the future  we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations 
we may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
we believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive  integrated solutions  our list of referenceable customers  the ability of our solutions to generate business benefits for our customers  our substantial investment in product development  our deep domain expertise  the ease of use of our software products  our customer support and implementation services  our ability to deploy quickly  and our ability to deliver rapid return on investment for our customers 
proprietary rights and licenses our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures 
table of contents and contractual provisions  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws  we also believe that factors such as the knowledge  ability  and experience of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we presently have no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
generally  copyrights on our products expire years after the year of first publication of each product 
it is our policy to enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks 
we provide our software products to customers under non exclusive license agreements 
as is customary in the software industry  in order to protect our intellectual property rights  we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the customer s use of our products  unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur 
in addition  we have licensed the source code for our software to american software  which owns approximately of our common stock  on a limited basis to enable american software to perform warranty  maintenance and support obligations for certain customers  for which it is responsible under certain license agreements that were not assigned to us in connection with the formation of logility 
despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any such claims against us  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by us against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require a substantial amount of attention from management  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we have re licensed  and expect in the future to re license  certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products 
there can be no assurance that these third party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination of any such licenses or product offerings  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
further  any such delay  if it becomes extended  could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations
