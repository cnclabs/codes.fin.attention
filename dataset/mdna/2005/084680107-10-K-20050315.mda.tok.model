the principal objectives of berkshire bank s interest rate risk management are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with its established policies 
berkshire bank maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets quarterly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the loan and investment committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the asset liability committee consists of five senior officers of the bank and the senior financial analyst 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of berkshire bank 
in recent years  berkshire bank has managed interest rate risk by o emphasizing the origination and purchase of adjustable rate loans  selling newly originated fixed rate mortgages on a flow basis and  from time to time  selling a portion of its longer term fixed rate loans as market interest rate conditions dictate  o securitizing a portion of the bank s long term  fixed rate mortgages  o originating shorter term commercial and consumer loans  o investing in high quality liquid investment securities that provide adequate liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from fluctuations in market interest rates  the overall maturity and duration of which is monitored in relation to the repricing of its loan and funding portfolios  o promoting lower cost liability accounts such as core deposits  and o using federal home loan bank advances to better structure maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
berkshire bank s market risk also includes equity price risk 
berkshire bank s marketable equity securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million at december  and no gross unrealized losses which are included  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of berkshire bank s shareholders equity 
if equity securities prices decline due to unfavorable market conditions or other factors  berkshire bank and berkshire hills capital would decrease 
in  management began a strategy to reduce the amount of equity securities it holds by gradually selling a portion of its holdings 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
berkshire hills uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income  incorporating various assumptions regarding the shape of the yield curve  the pricing characteristics of loans  deposits and borrowings  prepayments on loans and securities and changes in the balance sheet mix 
the model assumes the yield curve is derived from the interpolated treasury yield curve and that an instantaneous increase or decrease of market interest rates would cause a simultaneous parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
loans  deposits and borrowings are expected to reprice at the new market rate on the contractual review or maturity date 
the company closely monitors its loan prepayment trends and uses prepayment guidelines set forth by freddie mac and fannie mae and other market sources  as well as company generated data where applicable 
prepayment cash flows are rolled into various loan products based on a review of loan originations over the past six months  discussions with senior loan officers on the bank s asset liability committee and a review of the bank s plan for strategic growth over the next twelve months 
berkshire hills further assumes that its securities cash flows  especially its mortgage backed securities cash flows  are such that they will generally follow industry standards and that prepayments will be reinvested in categories that reflect the current investment strategy designed by senior management and approved by the board of directors 
finally  the model assumes that the bank s balance sheet mix will remain relatively unchanged throughout the next calendar year 
the tables below set forth  as of december  and  estimated net interest income and the estimated changes in berkshire hills net interest income for the next twelve month period  given instantaneous increases or decreases in market interest rates of and basis points 
increase decrease in at december  market interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands static  increase decrease in at december  market interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands static  in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing market interest rates of and basis points  the december  table indicates that net interest income would be expected to increase  and decrease million  respectively 
these results compare to the december  chart that indicates a sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing market interest rates of and basis points would cause the company s net interest income to increase by  and decrease by million 
the primary reason for this change compared to the previous year is the strategic plans that the company has undertaken to better prepare the bank for an increase in market interest rates  including the origination of adjustable rate commercial and residential mortgage loans  the origination of home equity lines of credit and the sale and securitization of fixed rate mortgages 
in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates of and basis points  the december  table indicates that net interest income would be expected to increase  and million  respectively  compared to the december  table  which indicates that net interest income would decrease by  and million  respectively 
again  these changes in the bank s interest rate risk sensitivity can be explained by management s desire to better position the bank for a potential rise in market interest rates and has done so by executing the above mentioned strategic plans throughout computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions including the level of market interest rates  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and investments  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on certificates of deposit and other deposit flows 
as a result  these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change as follows now accounts  money market accounts ranging between and depending on the balance  and savings accounts
