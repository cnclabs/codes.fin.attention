item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hancock fabrics  inc is a specialty retailer of fabric and related home sewing and decorating accessories in the united states  operating stores in states as of january  m tcs v our stores present a broad selection of fabrics and notions used in apparel sewing  home decorating and quilting projects 
the stores average approximately  total square feet  of which approximately  are on the sales floor 
during  the average sales per store was approximately thousand 
we use a number of key performance measures to evaluate our financial performance  including the following dollars in thousands 
imggif 
a new store is included in the comparable store sales computation immediately upon reaching its one year anniversary 
stores that are relocated are treated as new stores 
in those rare instances where stores are either expanded or down sized  the store is not treated as a new store and  therefore  remains in the computation of comparable store sales 
measures the degree to which sales translate to profits after deducting the product costs and operating expenses that are required to generate sales operating income divided by sales 
measures cash flows from operations  including earnings and changes in working capital see consolidated statements of cash flows 
measures the productivity of asset investments net earnings  excluding the impact of interest net of tax  divided by average total assets 
this calculation may or may not be comparable to other companies return on average assets  depending upon whether they exclude the impact of interest from net earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
significant accounting policies employed by hancock  including the use of estimates and assumptions  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on its historical experience  together with other relevant factors  in order to form the basis for making judgments  which will affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and makes changes to carrying values as deemed necessary 
hancock believes that estimates related to the following areas involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined by the lifo method 
as with other retailers  it is not practical to perform physical inventory counts for all stores on the last day of a period  therefore  certain assumptions must be made in order to record cost of sales and the related change in inventory for the period of time from each store s most recent physical count to the end of the period 
these assumptions for all stores that did not have inventory counts at period end are based on the actual gross margin trends realized by stores that were inventoried during the period 
m tcs v although  under certain circumstances  actual results could prove to be materially different from the estimates used  hancock has consistently used the same methodology throughout its existence with dependable results  and management believes that such methodology provides an inventory valuation which results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
insurance reserves 
workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance programs are largely self insured 
it is hancock s policy to record its self insurance liabilities using estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported or paid  based on historical trends and other relevant factors 
actual results can vary from estimates for many reasons including  among others  future inflation rates  claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations 
store closing reserves 
store closing reserves include estimates for net lease obligations and other store closing costs 
hancock recognizes store closing reserves at fair value in the period that an operating lease is considered terminated and a liability has been incurred in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
adjustments to store closing reserves are made  as necessary  in the period that events or circumstances requiring such reserve adjustments occur 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the value of assets and liabilities associated with pension and postretirement benefits is determined on an actuarial basis 
these values are affected by the market value of plan assets and estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates 
hancock determines the discount rates using changes in the rates of high quality  fixed income investments 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets  differences between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used affect the amount of pension expense recognized 
hancock expects pension and postretirement benefit expenses to change by less than during our pension and postretirement plans are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets 
hancock periodically reviews the net realizable value of long lived assets at the individual store level whenever events and circumstances indicate impairment has occurred 
in the event that the carrying values of long lived assets are in excess of estimated gross future cash flows for those assets  the values of the assets are written down to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the estimated future cash flows 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  is no longer amortized 
on an annual basis  the fair value of hancock s reporting units are compared with their carrying values 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  hancock would recognize the difference as an impairment charge 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted present value of future cash flows 
the company has two reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
each reporting unit consists of the stores acquired in two separate transactions that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
m tcs v results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of income data expressed as a percentage of sales for the period indicated 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 

imggif 
vs 
sales decreased million in due to a decline in sales of stores that were open more than one full year comparable store sales 
most of the decrease was caused by a lower average ticket  as customer traffic did not vary significantly between years 
the lower average ticket was attributable to several factors  including a decline in home decorating sales which tend to carry a higher price point  some deflation in apparel category price points and out of stocks in several key merchandise areas 
sales in the first half of the year were adversely affected by a weaker offering of spring merchandise  together with a delay in delivering the spring assortments to our stores as the result of relocating our distribution center to a new facility 
in addition  there was a loss of sales from a large number of product changeovers that were phased out prior to the replacement lines becoming available 
for the year  store selling square footage increased from  to  due to the net addition of stores 
gross margins declined from in to in due to more aggressive markdowns to clear seasonal goods and increased promotional efforts  both of which were in response to the slowing sales environment 
in addition  gross margin was negatively affected by the impact of a current year lifo last in  first out charge of thousand versus a prior year credit of million due to an increase in the u 
s 
department of labor s producer price index ppi that the company uses to measure inflation in inventories 
although not having a cash impact  lifo caused a million negative swing in gross profit  or about basis points of sales 
m tcs v selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the deleveraging impact on the expense ratio that results from negative comparable store sales was the primary factor affecting the comparison 
in addition  s expenses included a charge of million in for the required accelerated recognition of future retirement benefits for the company s retiring chairman and chief executive officer who retired at the end of overall  expense dollars were well controlled  increasing only  before the effect of the retirement charge  despite normal inflationary pressures on operating costs 
depreciation expense increased million in due primarily to capital expenditures related to the new distribution center and corporate office facility in baldwyn  mississippi and the implementation of a point of sale pos system in hancock s stores 
interest expense increased thousand due to the average outstanding debt rising from million during to million in in connection with funding of the new distribution center and corporate offices and implementation of the store pos systems 
income tax expense decreased million in due to a reduction in pretax earnings from hancock s effective tax rate was in both years 
vs 
sales increased million in due to a increase in comparable stores sales 
during  hancock opened stores and closed the improvement in comparable store sales was primarily driven by a sales increase in our home decorating category  which accounted for of sales in and in our store within a store home decorating concept was in place in of our store locations by year end 
comparable store sales in categories other than decorating were flat overall  with quilting  yarn and sewing machine sales rising  while fashion and special occasion fabric sales declined 
quilting has become one of our fastest growing product lines due mostly to partnerships with exclusive suppliers and industry personalities 
hancock s focus on teaching activities and product demonstrations in our stores also contributed to higher sales during the year 
gross margins increased to in from in as a result of product mix adjustments and the company s ability to better control promotional activities 
during  we continued to shift our merchandise mix towards higher margin home decorating products 
in addition  we focused on limiting significant promotional activities  which compromise gross margin  despite deep discounting activities by our competitors at various times during the year 
the increase in gross margin was partially offset  however  by a decrease in the lifo credit from million in to million in due to slightly less product cost deflation in that year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in  due primarily to costs associated with the relocation of our distribution operations to a new facility 
for most of the year  hancock operated two distribution centers which caused us to incur duplicate expenses for items such as depreciation  insurance  utilities and maintenance 
the actual transfer of inventory  fixtures  equipment and systems between the two facilities also resulted in higher expenses for items such as payroll and transportation 
the relocation of the distribution operations was completed just after fiscal year end 
normal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were adversely impacted during by the absence of sales leverage on fixed expenses and a thousand increase in pension expense m tcs v due to negative returns on plan assets in recent years and a lower discount rate 
in addition  the expense comparison in was negatively influenced by a gain of thousand on the sale of real estate in which was reflected as a reduction of expense 
income tax expense decreased million in due to a reduction in pretax earnings from hancock s effective tax rate was in both years 
liquidity and capital resources hancock has historically financed its operations with internally generated cash flow 
hancock maintains a strong financial position as evidenced by the following information as of the end of the past three fiscal years dollars in thousands 
imggif 
changes in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities in decreased from the prior year due to reduced earnings  offset by the resulting decline in accrued bonuses and income tax obligations 
in addition  inventory increased slightly due to the net addition of stores  partially offset by a decline in inventory levels from when extra inventory had been purchased in an attempt to protect against supply disruptions associated with the transfer of inventory to the new distribution center in the fourth quarter 
in  cash flows from operating activities increased from due to a voluntary pension plan contribution of million in made to improve the funding status of the plan 
the increase in was partially offset by higher inventory levels due to the addition of new product lines  such as yarn and small furniture  the expansion of our quilting category  and the extra inventory purchased in the fourth quarter as discussed above 
changes in accounts payable did not help to offset the inventory increase in as would normally be the case because the extra inventory had already been paid for by year end 
also  we have experienced some shortening of terms as we source more product overseas and we brought inventory in earlier throughout due to the import backlog that began with the longshoremen strike 
cash used for investing activities during the past three years has been at a rate significantly higher than hancock s historical trend due to capital expenditures associated with construction of the new headquarters distribution center and the installation of pos systems in hancock s stores 
m tcs v cash provided by financing activities in consisted mostly of net borrowings of million needed to fund the significant level of capital expenditures  less million of cash dividends 
in  cash used for financing activities included million of treasury stock purchases and million of cash dividends  partially offset by million of net borrowings and million of stock option proceeds 
in  treasury stock purchases and cash dividends used million and million  respectively  of cash  while stock option exercises provided cash of million 
in total  over the past three years  cash flows from operations  together with borrowings of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling million  were sufficient to allow hancock to purchase approximately million of property and equipment  pay over million of dividends and purchase more than million of treasury stock 
capital expenditures hancock s primary capital requirements are for the financing of inventories and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures relating to store locations and its distribution facility 
funds for such purposes are generated from hancock s operations and  if necessary  supplemented by borrowings from commercial lenders 
capital expenditures amounted to million in  million in and million in the new distribution center  implementation of pos  new store openings and ongoing capital maintenance were the primary capital items during this three year period 
equity in prior years and continuing in  hancock has repurchased over million shares  or approximately of its outstanding stock 
hancock plans to use future cash in excess of operating needs and capital investment for the payment of cash dividends and the purchase of treasury stock  as market and financial conditions dictate 
in evaluating treasury stock purchases  consideration is given to overall liquidity issues related to hancock s stock 
as of january   a total of  shares were available for repurchase under hancock s most recent authorization 
bank credit facilities in addition to its operating cash flows  hancock has two revolving credit facilities available with three banks  which provide a total of million of borrowing capacity 
management believes the total of million is adequate for hancock s foreseeable needs in the near term  although it may have a need for a seasonal overline during the early fall season when inventory levels are building in advance of the heavy selling season in november and december 
as of january   hancock had outstanding debt of million under these revolving credit agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s credit facilities 
general hancock estimates that capital expenditures for will be in a range of million to million 
anticipated expenditures include approximately million for new stores  with the remainder being primarily for ongoing capital maintenance in existing stores and at the distribution center 
internally generated funds supplemented by borrowings are expected to be m tcs v sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements in the near term 
we are attempting to execute sale leaseback transactions for five store properties that could generate as much as million to million of cash in in addition  our former distribution center corporate headquarters is being held for sale 
discussions have occurred with several interested parties  however  the timing and price of a sale cannot be reasonably predicted 
off balance sheet arrangements hancock has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
however  hancock does finance the use of its retail fabric locations under noncancelable operating leases 
since the terms of these arrangements meet the definition of operating leases  the sum of the future lease payments is not reflected on hancock s balance sheet 
such minimum rental payments are reflected in the table below 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and commitments as of january  
imggif 
other cash obligations that have been excluded from the contractual obligations table include postretirement benefits other than pensions  pension funding obligations  interest costs associated with debt obligations and amounts included in other noncurrent liabilities for workers compensation  deferred compensation and stepped rent 
contributions to the postretirement medical dental life benefit plans are made as benefits are paid to the participants 
claims paid in  and totaled   and  respectively 
the company expects claims for to be higher than prior years due to an aging population and increases in the assumed medical trend rates 
hancock has not yet decided whether or not it will make a contribution to the pension plan in interest payments are excluded from the table because they are variable and unknown 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  hancock has a million standby letter of credit to guarantee payment of potential future workers compensation claims 
hancock also has an arrangement that provides for up to million in trade letters of credit 
at january   hancock had commitments under this arrangement of thousand on issued letters of credit which support purchase orders for merchandise to be imported 
the company has no standby repurchase obligations or guarantees of other entities debt 
m tcs v related party transactions hancock has no balances with any related parties  nor has it had any material transactions with related parties during the three year period ended january  effects of inflation the impact of inflation on labor and occupancy costs can significantly affect hancock s operations 
many of hancock s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage requirements  accordingly  any increases will affect hancock 
in addition  payroll taxes  employee benefits and other employee costs continue to increase 
health insurance costs  in particular  continue to rise at an unsettling rate in the united states each year  and higher employer contributions to hancock s pension plan could be necessary if investment returns are weak 
costs of leases for new store locations remain stable  but renewal costs of older leases continue to increase 
hancock believes the practice of maintaining adequate operating margins through a combination of price adjustments and cost controls  careful evaluation of occupancy needs and efficient purchasing practices are the most effective tools for coping with increased costs and expenses 
inflation is one of the key factors used in the calculation of the lifo charge or credit to cost of sales 
in  an increase in the ppi resulted in a lifo charge 
a deflationary trend in the ppi in and caused a lifo credit 
seasonality hancock s business is seasonal 
peak sales periods occur during the fall and pre easter weeks  while the lowest sales periods occur during the summer and the month of january

competitive changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
although we are one of the largest fabric retailers in the united states and principally compete with only one national fabric craft store chain  a few small fabric chains and numerous independent fabric stores  changes in our competitive environment could adversely impact our operations 
such changes include  but are not limited to  the following m tcs v liquidation of inventory in hancock s markets caused by a competitor s store closings or need to dispose of inventory  new entrants into the retail fabric industry  expansion by existing competitors into our markets  and increased competitive pricing strategies 
adverse general economic factors can significantly impact our business 
general economic conditions that are beyond the company s control can adversely impact our operating results 
these factors include increased interest rates in periods of borrowings  consumer debt levels  tax rates and policies  unemployment trends  recession  inflation  deflation and other matters that affect consumer confidence and spending 
delays or interruptions in the flow of merchandise through our distribution center could adversely impact our operating results 
approximately of hancock s store shipments pass through the company s distribution center 
the remainder of merchandise is drop shipped by our vendors directly to our store locations 
damage or interruption to the distribution center from factors such as fire  power loss  storm damage or unanticipated supplier shipment delays could cause a disruption in our operations 
the occurrence of unanticipated problems at our distribution center would likely result in increased operating expenses and reduced sales which would negatively impact our operating results 
a disruption in the performance of our information systems could occur

political or financial instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our operating results 
a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our operating results for the year 
like many retailers  the company s strongest quarter in terms of sales  net earnings and cash flow is the fourth quarter 
if  for any reason  our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  our operating results for the full year would be negatively impacted  and we could have substantial excess inventory that could be difficult to liquidate
