m a r i n e c o n s t r u c t i o n s e r v i c es general the marine construction services segment s business involves the front end and detailed engineering  fabrication and installation of offshore drilling and production facilities and installation of marine pipelines and subsea production systems 
this segment also provides comprehensive project management and procurement services 
this segment operates in most major offshore oil and gas producing regions throughout the world  including the us gulf of mexico  mexico  south america  the middle east  india  the caspian sea and asia pacific 
see section i  risk factors  and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information on significant losses incurred by jrm in prior years 
marine construction vessels and properties we operate a large fleet of marine vessels used in major offshore construction 
the nucleus of a marine construction spread is a large derrick barge  pipelaying barge or combination derrick pipelaying barge capable of offshore operations for an extended period of time in remote locations 
we currently own or  through our ownership interests in joint ventures  operate two derrick vessels  one pipelaying vessel and nine combination derrick pipelaying vessels 
we also operate a pipelay vessel for a subdivision of the state owned oil company of azerbaijan 
the lifting capacities of our derrick and combination derrick pipelaying vessels range from to  tons 
these vessels range in length from to feet and are fully equipped with stiff leg or revolving cranes  auxiliary cranes  welding equipment  pile driving hammers  anchor winches and a variety of additional equipment 
six of the vessels are self propelled  with two also having dynamic positioning systems 
we also have a substantial inventory of specialized support equipment for intermediate water and deepwater construction and pipelay 
in 
table of contents addition  we own or lease a substantial number of other vessels  such as tugboats  utility boats  launch barges and cargo barges  to support the operations of our major marine construction vessels

f leased and operated by our malaysian joint venture 
g the dimensions of this vessel are x x 
governmental regulations  our insurance policies and some of our financing arrangements require us to maintain our vessels in accordance with standards of seaworthiness and safety set by governmental authorities or classification societies 
we maintain our fleet to the standards for seaworthiness  safety and health set by the american bureau of shipping  den norske veritas and other world recognized classification societies 
our principal fabrication facilities are located near morgan city  louisiana  in indonesia on batam island and in dubai  uae in addition  we operate  through a interest in a consolidated subsidiary  a ship repair facility in veracruz  mexico  which we have used as a fabrication facility from time to time 
we also operate a portion of the baku deepwater jacket factory fabrication facility in baku  azerbaijan 
the baku deepwater jacket factory facility is a wholly owned subsidiary of the state oil company of the azerbaijan republic 
our fabrication facilities are equipped with a wide variety of heavy duty construction and fabrication equipment  including cranes  welding equipment  machine tools and robotic and other automated equipment 
we fabricate a full range of offshore structures  from conventional jacket type fixed platforms to intermediate water and deepwater platform configurations employing spar  compliant tower and tension leg technologies  as well as floating  production  storage and offtake fpso technology 

table of contents expiration dates  including renewal options  of leases covering land for jrm s fabrication facilities at december  were as follows morgan city  louisiana years jebel ali  uae year batam island  indonesia year veracruz  mexico year as a result of renewal options on the various tracts comprising the morgan city fabrication facility  we have the ability  within our sole discretion  to continue leasing almost all the land we are currently using for that facility until foreign operations jrm s revenues  net of intersegment revenues  and its segment income loss derived from operations located outside of the united states  as well as the approximate percentages to our total consolidated revenues and total consolidated segment income loss  respectively  for each of the last three years were as follows revenues segment income loss amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  excludes million goodwill impairment charge 
we participate in joint ventures involving operations in foreign countries that sometimes require majority ownership by local interests 
one of our joint ventures  construcciones maritimas mexicanas  sa de sa  is a mexican joint venture which provides marine installation services for pemex in the gulf of mexico  in which we own a interest 
raw materials our marine construction services segment uses raw materials  such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms  welding gases  paint  fuels and lubricants  which are available from many sources 
jrm does not depend on any single supplier or source for any of these materials 
although shortages of some of these materials and fuels have existed from time to time  no material shortage currently exists 
however  steel prices are volatile and increasing and deliveries are less than orderly  indicating that shortages may occur in the near future 
competition we believe we are among the few marine construction contractors capable of providing the full range of services in major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world 
we believe that the substantial capital costs involved in becoming a full service marine construction contractor create a significant barrier to entry into the market as a global  fully integrated competitor 
we do  however  face substantial competition from regional competitors and less integrated providers of marine construction services  such as engineering firms  fabrication facilities  pipelaying companies and shipbuilders 
a number of companies compete with us in each of the separate marine pipelay and construction and fabrication phases in various parts of the world 
these competitors include allseas marine contractors sa  daewoo engineering construction co  ltd  global industries ltd  npcc abu dhabi  heerema group  hyundai heavy industrial co  ltd  kiewit offshore services  ltd  nippon steel corporation  saipem spa  stolt offshore spa and technip sa contracts are usually awarded on a competitive bid basis 
although we believe customers consider  among other things  the availability and technical capabilities of equipment and personnel  efficiency  condition of equipment  safety record and reputation  price competition is normally the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor with available equipment is awarded a contract 
major marine construction vessels have few alternative uses and  because of their nature and the environment in which they work  have 
table of contents relatively high maintenance costs whether or not they are operating 
see discussion in risk factors for additional information on the competitive nature of our marine construction services segment 
customers jrm s customers are primarily oil and gas companies  including several foreign government owned companies 
jrm s five largest customers during were azerbaijan international operating company  bp plc and its subsidiaries  ras laffan liquified natural gas company limited  murphy oil corporation and pt brown and root indonesia which accounted for    and of our total consolidated revenues  respectively 
jrm s five largest customers during  bp plc  azerbaijan international operating company  ras laffan liquified natural gas company limited  murphy oil corporation  and dominion resources  inc  accounted for    and of our total consolidated revenues  respectively 
in  we entered into a contract with a unit of bp plc for the exclusive use of our morgan city  louisiana fabrication facility for a period of approximately three years to perform fabrication of topsides facilities for four new major deepwater hubs for the gulf of mexico holstein  thunder horse  mad dog and atlantis 
historically  this arrangement has been cost plus  but it was reduced to an hourly rate in we expect the agreement to expire in the level of engineering and construction services required by any one customer depends upon the amount of that customer s capital expenditure budget for offshore marine construction services any single year 
consequently  customers that account for a significant portion of revenues in one year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent years 
contracts we have historically performed work on a fixed price  cost plus or day rate basis or a combination of these methods 
most of our long term contracts have provisions for progress payments 
we recognize our contract revenues and related costs on a percentage of completion basis 
accordingly  we review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in income proportionate to the percentage of completion in the period when we revise those estimates 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project  we would recognize a charge against current earnings  which could be material 
we attempt to cover anticipated increases in costs of labor  material and service costs of our long term contracts  either through an estimate of such charges  which is reflected in the original price  or through price escalation clauses 
however  for certain projects we have been unable to accurately forecast total cost to complete until we have performed all major phases of the project 
our experience on these long term contracts has shown that revenue  cost and gross profit realized on fixed price contracts will often vary from the original and subsequently estimated amounts because of changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
we may experience reduced profitability or losses on projects as a result of these variations and the risks inherent in the marine construction industry  including  but not limited to  operating in foreign countries  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failures and pollution or other environmental mishaps 
our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit or bid and performance bonds to secure bids or performance under contracts for marine construction services 
while these letters of credit and bonds may involve significant dollar amounts  historically there have been no material payments to our customers under these arrangements 
these arrangements are typical in the industry for projects outside the us gulf of mexico 
backlog as of december  and  our marine construction services segment s backlog amounted to approximately billion and billion  respectively 
this represents approximately and of our total 
table of contents consolidated backlog at december  and  respectively 
of the december  backlog  we expect to recognize approximately million in revenues in and million in while fabrication projects are typically awarded substantially in advance of performance as a result of the required lead time for procurement  the marine construction industry is highly seasonal in some geographic regions 
because of the more conducive weather conditions  most installation operations are conducted in the warmer months of the year in those areas  and many of these contracts are awarded with only a short period of time before the desired time of project performance 
projects in our backlog may be cancelled by customers 
significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
factors affecting demand our marine construction services segment s activity depends mainly on the capital expenditures for offshore marine construction services of oil and gas companies and foreign governments for construction of development projects 
numerous factors influence these expenditures  including oil and gas prices  along with expectations about future prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the terms and conditions of offshore leases  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  the ability of businesses in the oil and gas industry to raise capital  and local and international political and economic conditions

g o v e r n m e n t o p e r a t i o n s general our government operations segment provides nuclear components and various services to the us government 
examples of this segment s activities include environmental restoration services and the management of government owned facilities  primarily within the nuclear weapons complex of the doe 
this segment s principal plants are located in lynchburg  virginia  barberton  ohio  and mount vernon  indiana 
bwxt conducts all the operations of our government operations segment 
raw materials our government operations segment relies on certain single source suppliers for materials used in its products 
we believe these suppliers are viable  and we and the us government expend significant effort to maintain the supplier base 
customers and competition our government operations segment supplies nuclear components for the us government 
there are a limited number of suppliers of specialty nuclear components  with bwxt being the largest based on revenues 
through the operations of this segment  we are also involved along with other companies in the operation of the idaho national laboratory near idaho falls  idaho  the rocky flats environmental technology site near boulder  colorado  the savannah river site in aiken  south carolina  the strategic petroleum reserve in louisiana and texas  the pantex site in amarillo  texas  the oak ridge national lab site the y facility in oak ridge  tennessee  and the miamisburg closure project in miamisburg  ohio 
our competition in the operation of these facilities include bechtel national inc  washington group international  chm hill  inc  fluor corporation and nuclear fuel services  inc 
table of contents all of these contracts are subject to annual funding determinations by the us government 
the us government accounted for approximately  and of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  including  and  respectively  related to nuclear components 
backlog at december  and  our government operations segment s backlog amounted to billion and billion  or approximately and  respectively  of our total consolidated backlog 
of the december  backlog in this segment  we expect to recognize revenues of approximately million in  million in and million thereafter  of which we expect to recognize approximately in through at december   this segment s backlog with the us government was billion of which million had not yet been funded  or approximately of our total consolidated backlog 
during the year ended december   the us government awarded this segment new orders of approximately million 
factors affecting demand our government operations segment s operations are generally capital intensive on the manufacturing side 
this segment may be impacted by us government budget restraints and delays 
the demand for nuclear components for the us government comprises a substantial portion of this segment s backlog 
we expect that orders for nuclear components will continue to be a significant part of backlog for the foreseeable future  however such orders are subject to defense department budget constraints 
see section i for further information on factors affecting demand

p a t e n t s and l i c e n s e s we currently hold a large number of us and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications 
we have acquired patents and licenses and granted licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so 
although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us  we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole 
in general  we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our various businesses 
e 
r e s e a r c h and d e v e l o p m e n t a c t i v i t i e s we conduct our principal research and development activities through individual business units at our various manufacturing plants and engineering and design offices 
our research and development activities cost approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
contractual arrangements for customer sponsored research and development can vary on a case by case basis and include contracts  cooperative agreements and grants 
of our total research and development expenses  our customers paid for approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
f 
i n s u r a n c e we maintain liability and property insurance in amounts we consider adequate for those risks we consider necessary 
some risks are not insurable or insurance to cover them is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical 
these risks include war and confiscation of property in some areas of the world  pollution liability in excess of relatively low limits and asbestos liability 
depending on competitive conditions and other factors  we endeavor to obtain contractual protection against uninsured risks from our customers 
insurance or contractual indemnity protection  when obtained  may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 

table of contents our insurance policies do not insure against liability and property damage losses resulting from nuclear accidents at reactor facilities of our utility customers 
to protect against liability for damage to a customer s property  we endeavor to obtain waivers of subrogation from the customer and its insurer and are usually named as an additional insured under the utility customer s nuclear property policy 
to protect against liability from claims brought by third parties  we are insured under the utility customer s nuclear liability policies and have the benefit of the indemnity and limitation of any applicable liability provision of the price anderson act 
the price anderson act limits the public liability of manufacturers and operators of licensed nuclear facilities and other parties who may be liable in respect of  and indemnifies them against  all claims in excess of a certain amount 
this amount is determined by the sum of commercially available liability insurance plus certain retrospective premium assessments payable by operators of commercial nuclear reactors 
for those sites where we provide environmental remediation services  we seek the same protection from our customers as we do for our other nuclear activities 
the price anderson act  as amended  includes a sunset provision and requires renewal each time that it expires 
contracts that were entered into during a period of time that price anderson was in full force and effect continue to receive the benefit of the price anderson act nuclear indemnity 
the price anderson act last expired on december   but was extended for an additional two years through december  bwxt currently has no contracts involving nuclear materials that are not covered by and subject to the nuclear indemnity of the price anderson act 
although we do not own or operate any nuclear reactors  we have coverage under commercially available nuclear liability and property insurance for three of our four locations that are licensed to possess special nuclear materials 
the fourth location operated primarily as a conventional research center 
this facility is licensed to possess special nuclear material and has a small and limited amount of special nuclear material on the premises 
two of the four facilities are located at our lynchburg  virginia site 
these facilities are insured under a nuclear liability policy that also insures the facility of framatome cogema fuel company fcfc  formerly b w fuel company  which we sold during the fiscal year ended march  all three licensed facilities share the same nuclear liability insurance limit  as the commercial insurer would not allow fcfc to obtain a separate nuclear liability insurance policy 
due to the type or quantity of nuclear material present under contract with the us government  the two facilities in lynchburg have statutory indemnity and limitation of liability under the price anderson act 
in addition  our contracts to manufacture and supply nuclear components to the us government contain statutory indemnity clauses under which the us government has assumed the risks of public liability claims related to nuclear incidents 
bwxt  through two of its dedicated limited liability companies  has management and operating agreements with the us government for the pantex and y facilities 
most insurable liabilities arising from these sites are not protected in our corporate insurance program but rely on government contractual agreements and certain specialized self insurance programs funded by the us government 
the us government has historically fulfilled its contractual agreement to reimburse for insurable claims  and we expect it to continue this process during our administration of these two facilities 
however  in most of these situations in which the u 
s 
government is contractually obligated to pay  the payment obligation is subject to the availability of authorized government funds 
jrm s offshore construction business is subject to the usual risks of operations at sea  including accidents resulting in the loss of life or property  pollution or other environmental mishaps  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failures  collisions  property losses to our vessels  business interruption due to political action in foreign countries  and labor stoppages 
jrm has additional exposure because it uses expensive construction equipment  sometimes under extreme weather conditions  often in remote areas of the world 
in many cases  jrm also operates on or in proximity to existing offshore facilities 
these facilities are subject to damage that could result in the escape of oil and gas into the sea 
litigation arising from any such event may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
depending on competitive conditions and other factors  we have endeavored to obtain contractual protection against uninsured risks from our customers 
when obtained  such contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases be supported by adequate insurance maintained by the customer 
these contractual protections are not available in all cases 
in addition  in recent years  we have been named as a defendant in litigation concerning exposure to lead based paint  silica  asbestos and welding rod fumes 
while we are vigorously defending these claims  it is possible that existing insurance will not be sufficient to cover all potential exposure should these proceedings result in an adverse decision for us 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on these issues 
as a result of the asbestos contained in boilers and other products b w and certain of its subsidiaries sold  installed or serviced in prior decades  b w is subject to a substantial volume of nonemployee liability claims 
table of contents asserting asbestos related injuries 
the vast majority of these claims relate to exposure to asbestos occurring prior to  the year in which the us occupational safety and health administration adopted new regulations that impose liability on employers for  among other things  job site exposure to asbestos 
b w received its first asbestos claims in initially  b w s primary insurance carrier  a unit of travelers group  handled the claims 
b w exhausted the limits of its primary products liability insurance coverage in prior to its chapter filing  b w had been handling the claims under a claims handling program funded primarily by reimbursements from its excess coverage insurance carriers 
b w s excess coverage available for asbestos related products liability claims runs from through march this coverage has been provided by a total of insurance companies 
b w obtained varying amounts of excess coverage insurance for each year within that period  and within each year there are typically several increments of coverage 
for each of those increments  a syndicate of insurance companies has provided the coverage 
b w had agreements with the majority of its excess coverage insurers concerning the method of allocating products liability asbestos claim payments to the years of coverage under the applicable policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding b w s chapter filing and liability for nonemployee asbestos claims 
we have several wholly owned insurance subsidiaries that provide general and automotive liability insurance and  from time to time  builder s risk within certain limits  marine hull and workers compensation insurance to our companies 
these insurance subsidiaries have not provided significant amounts of insurance to unrelated parties 
these captive insurers provide certain coverages for our subsidiary entities and related coverages 
claims as a result of our operations  or arising in the b w chapter proceedings  could adversely impact the ability of these captive insurers to respond to all claims presented  although we believe such a result is unlikely 
as a result of the impact of the september  terrorist attacks  we have experienced higher costs  higher deductibles and more restrictive terms and conditions as we have renewed our insurance coverage 
specifically  several of our insurance programs  including property  onshore builder s risk and others  now contain exclusions that were not previously applicable  including war and acts of terrorism 
this issue has been impacted by the terrorism risk insurance act  although at this point insurers are quite divergent in the prices and coverage they are offering 
we expect to continue to maintain coverage that we consider adequate at rates that we consider economical 
however  some previously insured risks may no longer be insurable or insurance to cover them will be available only at rates that we consider uneconomical 
g 
e m p l o y e e s at december   we employed approximately  persons compared with  at december  approximately  of our employees were members of labor unions at december   compared with approximately  at december  many of our operations are subject to union contracts  which we customarily renew periodically 
currently  we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
h 
g o v e r n m e n t a l r e g u l a t i o n s and e n v i r o n m e n t a l m a t t e r s general many aspects of our operations and properties are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations  including those relating to construction and equipping of offshore production platforms and other marine facilities  constructing and equipping electric power and other industrial facilities  possessing and processing special nuclear materials  marine vessel safety  workplace health and safety  currency conversions and repatriation  taxation of foreign earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  and protecting the environment 

table of contents in addition  we depend on the demand for our marine construction services from the oil and gas industry and  therefore  are affected by changing taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally 
the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services 
we are required by various other governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain certain permits  licenses and certificates with respect to our operations 
the kinds of permits  licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors 
the exploration and development of oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the united states is regulated primarily under the us outer continental shelf lands act and regulations promulgated thereunder 
these laws require the construction  operation and removal of offshore production facilities located on the outer continental shelf of the united states to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
similar regulations govern the plugging and abandoning of wells located on the outer continental shelf of the united states and the removal of all production facilities 
violations of regulations issued pursuant to the us outer continental shelf lands act and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we cannot determine the extent to which new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations 
environmental our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees 
sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits  corrective action orders  administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution 
some environmental laws provide for strict  joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances  as well as damage to natural resources 
in addition  companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
these laws and regulations include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended cercla  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act and similar laws that provide for responses to  and liability for  releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
these laws and regulations also include similar foreign  state or local counterparts to these federal laws  which regulate air emissions  water discharges  hazardous substances and waste  and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances 
our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  primarily  in the united states  the occupational safety and health act and regulations promulgated thereunder 
we are currently in the process of investigating and remediating some of our former operating sites 
although we have recorded reserves in connection with certain of these matters  due to the uncertainties associated with environmental remediation  we cannot assure you that the actual costs resulting from these remediation matters will not exceed the recorded reserves 
our compliance with us federal  state and local environmental control and protection regulations resulted in pretax charges of approximately million in the year ended december  in addition  compliance with existing environmental regulations necessitated capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  we expect to spend another million on such capital expenditures over the next five years 
we cannot predict all of the environmental requirements or circumstances that will exist in the future but anticipate that environmental control and protection standards will become increasingly stringent and costly 
based on our experience to date  we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated 
table of contents financial position as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations 
however  future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation  more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies  or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may require additional expenditures by us  which may be material 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future 
in addition  offshore construction and drilling in some areas have been opposed by environmental groups and  in some areas  have been restricted 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry in particular  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under cercla 
cercla and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties  regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct 
generally  however  where there are multiple responsible parties  a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties  although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site 
we have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites 
on the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site  we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity in any given year 
environmental remediation projects have been and continue to be undertaken at certain of our current and former plant sites 
during the fiscal year ended march   we decided to close b w s nuclear manufacturing facilities in parks township  armstrong county  pennsylvania the parks facilities  and b w proceeded to decommission the facilities in accordance with its existing license from the nuclear regulatory commission the nrc 
b w subsequently transferred the facilities to bwxt in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   bwxt reached an agreement with the nrc on a plan that provides for the completion of facilities dismantlement and soil restoration by and license termination in bwxt filed its application to terminate the nrc license for the parks township facility and the nrc terminated the license in and released the facility for unrestricted use 
at december   the remaining provision for the decontamination  decommissioning and closing of these facilities was million 
for a discussion of certain civil litigation we are involved in concerning the parks facilities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the department of environmental protection of the commonwealth of pennsylvania padep advised b w in march that it would seek monetary sanctions and remedial and monitoring relief related to the parks facilities 
the relief sought related to potential groundwater contamination resulting from previous operations at the facilities 
bwxt now owns these facilities 
padep has advised bwxt that it does not intend to assess any monetary sanctions  provided that bwxt continues its remediation program for the parks facilities 
whether additional nonradiation contamination remediation will be required at the parks facility remains unclear 
bwxt has performed a risk assessment that indicates that no additional work is necessary for non radiation contamination of the parks facility 
we expect to meet with representatives of the padep in march to review the risk assessment and to discuss whether additional work will be required 
we perform significant amounts of work for the us government under both prime contracts and subcontracts and operate certain facilities that are licensed to possess and process special nuclear materials 
as a result of these activities  we are subject to continuing reviews by governmental agencies  including the environmental protection agency and the nrc 
the nrc s decommissioning regulations require bwxt and mti to provide financial assurance that they will be able to pay the expected cost of decommissioning their facilities at the end of their service lives 
bwxt and mti will continue to provide financial assurance aggregating million during the year ending december  with existing letters of credit for the ultimate decommissioning of all their licensed facilities  except one 
this facility  which represents the largest portion of bwxt s eventual decommissioning costs  has provisions in its government contracts pursuant to which all of its decommissioning costs and financial assurance obligations are covered by the doe 

table of contents an agreement between the nrc and the state of ohio to transfer regulatory authority for mti s nrc licenses for by product and source nuclear material was finalized in december in conjunction with the transfer of this regulatory authority and upon notification by the nrc  mti issued decommissioning financial assurance instruments naming the state of ohio as the beneficiary 
at december  and  we had total environmental reserves including provisions for the facilities discussed above of million and million  respectively 
of our total environmental reserves at december  and  million and million  respectively  were included in current liabilities 
our estimated recoveries of these costs totaling million are included in accounts receivable other in our consolidated balance sheet at december  and inherent in the estimates of those reserves and recoveries are our expectations regarding the levels of contamination  decommissioning costs and recoverability from other parties  which may vary significantly as decommissioning activities progress 
accordingly  changes in estimates could result in material adjustments to our operating results  and the ultimate loss may differ materially from the amounts we have provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
i 
r i s k f a c t o r s if we are unable to finalize a settlement in the b w chapter proceedings  including obtaining the requisite approvals and court confirmation  with substantially the same terms as contained in the agreement in principle  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
during the year ended december   we reached an agreement in principle with the asbestos claimants committee the acc and the future claimants representative the fcr in the b w chapter proceedings  which includes the following key terms  among others mii would effectively assign all its equity in b w to a trust to be created for the benefit of the asbestos personal injury claimants 
mii and all its subsidiaries would assign  transfer or otherwise make available their rights to all applicable insurance proceeds to the trust 
mii would issue million shares of restricted common stock and cause those shares to be transferred to the trust  and mii would effectively guarantee that those shares would have a value of per share on the third anniversary of the date of their issuance 
mi would issue promissory notes to the trust in an aggregate principal amount of million  with principal payments of million per year payable over years  with interest payable on the outstanding balance at the rate of per year 
the payment obligations under those notes would be guaranteed by mii 
in exchange for those contributions  mii and its subsidiaries other than b w and its subsidiaries would be released and indemnified from and against claims arising from b w s use of asbestos and would receive other protections from claims arising from b w activities 
the terms of the agreement in principle are reflected in a third amended joint plan of reorganization and accompanying form of settlement agreement that was recommended for confirmation by the bankruptcy court on october  as of december   we have recorded an estimate for the cost of the proposed settlement 
however  there are continuing risks and uncertainties that will remain with us until all requisite approvals are obtained and the final settlement is reflected in a nonappealable order of confirmation 
an agreed or litigated settlement  or the final decision by the court  could result in the ultimate liability exceeding amounts recorded as of december  the asbestos claims and the b w chapter proceedings require a significant amount of management s attention  and they represent an uncertainty in the financial marketplace 
until the uncertainty is resolved  we may be unable to deliver to our shareholders the maximum value potentially available to them through our operations and businesses  taken as a whole 
there is no assurance that the proposed joint plan of reorganization  or any amendment thereto  will be approved by the court 
there are a number of issues and matters to be resolved before the ultimate outcome of the b w chapter proceedings can be determined  including  among others  the following the ultimate asbestos liability of b w and its subsidiaries  the outcome of negotiations with our insurers as to additional amounts of coverage available to b w and its subsidiaries and their participation in the funding of the settlement trust  
table of contents the bankruptcy court s and us district court s decisions relating to numerous substantive and procedural aspects of the chapter proceedings  the outcome of objections and potential appeals involving approval of the disclosure statement and confirmation of the plan of reorganization  conversion of b w s debtor in possession financing to exit financing  the continued ability of our insurers to reimburse b w and its subsidiaries for payments made to asbestos claimants and the resolution of claims filed by insurers for recovery of insurance amounts previously paid for asbestos personal injury claims  and other insurance related issues 
we have significant guarantee obligations  other contingent claim exposures and collateral agreements with creditors and customers of our subsidiaries  including b w  that could adversely impact our future liquidity and access to capital resources 
mii has entered into credit arrangements to support its operating subsidiaries and  in some cases  guaranteed or otherwise become contingently liable for the credit arrangements and customer contractual obligations of its subsidiaries 
these exposures include the following b w letter of credit exposure 
at the time of the b w bankruptcy filing  mii was a maker or a guarantor of outstanding letters of credit aggregating approximately million that were issued in connection with the business operations of b w and its subsidiaries 
at that time  mi and bwico were similarly obligated with respect to additional letters of credit aggregating approximately million that were issued in connection with the business operations of b w and its subsidiaries 
although a permitted use of b w s debtor in possession revolving credit facility the dip credit facility is the issuance of new letters of credit to backstop or replace these preexisting letters of credit  each of mii  mi and bwico has agreed to indemnify and reimburse b w and its filing subsidiaries for any customer draw on any letter of credit issued under the dip credit facility to backstop or replace any such preexisting letter of credit for which it has exposure and for the associated letter of credit fees paid under the facility 
as of december   approximately million in letters of credit has been issued under the dip credit facility to replace or backstop these preexisting letters of credit 
indemnification obligations under surety arrangements 
mii has agreed to indemnify our two surety companies for obligations of various subsidiaries of mii  including b w and several of its subsidiaries  under surety bonds issued to meet bid bond and performance bond requirements imposed by their customers 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding amount of surety bonds that were guaranteed by mii and issued in connection with the business operations of its subsidiaries was approximately million  of which million related to the business operations of b w and its subsidiaries 
as to the guarantee and indemnity obligations related to b w  the proposed b w chapter settlement contemplates indemnification and other protections for mii  mi and bwico 
the existence of these arrangements may adversely impact our flexibility in accessing new capital resources to address liquidity issues or other needs for capital that may arise in the future 
our marine construction services segment derives substantially all its revenues from companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 
the demand for marine construction services has traditionally been cyclical  depending primarily on the capital expenditures of oil and gas companies for construction of development projects 
these capital expenditures are influenced by such factors as prevailing oil and gas prices  expectations about future prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the sale and expiration dates of available offshore leases  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  domestic and international political  military  regulatory and economic conditions  technological advances  and 
table of contents the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds for capital expenditures 
prices for oil and gas historically have been extremely volatile and have reacted to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas including changes resulting from the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to establish and maintain production quotas  domestic and worldwide economic conditions and political instability in oil producing countries 
we anticipate prices for oil and natural gas will continue to be volatile and affect the demand for and pricing of our marine construction services 
a material decline in oil or natural gas prices or activities over a sustained period of time could materially adversely affect the demand for our marine construction services and  therefore  our results of operations and financial condition 
war  other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the war in iraq as well as the terrorist attacks of september  and subsequent terrorist attacks and unrest  have caused instability in the world s financial and commercial markets  have significantly increased political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas 
the continuing instability and unrest in iraq  as well as threats of war or other armed conflict elsewhere  may cause further disruption to financial and commercial markets and contribute to even higher levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas 
in addition  the continued unrest in iraq could lead to acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours 
in addition  acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate  such as the middle east and indonesia  could limit or disrupt our markets and operations  including disruptions from evacuation of personnel  cancellation of contracts or the loss of personnel or assets 
armed conflicts  terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future 
we are subject to risks associated with contractual pricing in the offshore marine construction industry  including the risk that  if our actual costs exceed the costs we estimate on our fixed price contracts  our profitability will decline and we may suffer losses 
because of the highly competitive nature of the offshore marine construction industry  our marine construction services segment performs a substantial number of its projects on a fixed price basis 
we attempt to cover increased costs of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs of long term contracts  either through estimates of cost increases  which are reflected in the original contract price  or through price escalation clauses 
despite these attempts  however  the revenue  cost and gross profit we realize on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
these variations and the risks generally inherent in the marine construction industry may result in actual revenues or costs being different from those we originally estimated and may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
in particular  if steel prices rise beyond what we have estimated  we may suffer reduced profitability or losses on our fixed price projects  including those contracts in our backlog 
during and  our marine construction services segment experienced material losses on three of our spar projects  medusa  devils tower and front runner  the carina aries project  and the belanak fpso project 
these contracts contained first of a kind aspects for jrm  and were long term in nature 
we experienced schedule delays and cost overruns on these contracts that adversely impacted our financial results and liquidity 
as disclosed in our annual report on form k  we had identified certain matters involving internal controls and operations of our marine construction services segment which  among other things  impacted our ability to accurately forecast total cost to complete fixed price contracts  primarily first of a kind projects  until all major phases of the work were performed 
we also received a letter from our auditors advising that our inability to accurately estimate the cost to complete these types of contracts was considered a material weakness 
please read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates  for a discussion of the actions we have taken to address this issue 
in addition  we recognize revenues under our long term contracts in the marine construction services segment on a percentage of completion basis 
accordingly  we review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion in income in the period when we revise those estimates 
to the extent these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project  we would recognize a charge against current earnings  which could be material 
our current estimates of our contract costs and the profitability of our long term projects could change  and adjustments to overall contract costs may continue to be significant in future periods 

table of contents we face risks associated with investing in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures  including the risk that we may be restricted in our ability to access the cash flows or assets of these entities 
we conduct some operations through foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures 
we do not manage all of these entities 
even in those joint ventures that we manage  we are often required to consider the interests of our joint venture partners in connection with decisions concerning the operations of the joint ventures 
arrangements involving these subsidiaries and joint ventures may restrict us from gaining access to the cash flows or assets of these entities 
in addition  these foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures sometimes face governmentally imposed restrictions on their abilities to transfer funds to us 
at december   jrm had approximately million in accounts and notes receivable due from one of its joint ventures in mexico and expects to generate revenues and cash flows in from the charter of two of its vessels to this venture 
the note receivable is attributable to the sale of jrm s db vessel during the quarter ended september  in addition  jrm also had approximately million in currency translation losses associated with this joint venture in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  this joint venture is experiencing liquidity problems attributable to tax assessment issues and potential consequential damages due to cancellation of a contract with its major customer 
while this joint venture is current on its obligations to jrm  it is possible that jrm could experience delays in collection of and ultimate realization of its receivables from this joint venture 
recognition of a gain of approximately million on the sale of the db is currently being deferred 
our international operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties not encountered in our domestic operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from international operations  including customers in the middle east 
our international operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties not generally encountered in our us operations 
these include risks of war  terrorism and civil unrest  expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of our assets  renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts  changing political conditions and changing laws and policies affecting trade and investment  the overlap of different tax structures  and the risks associated with the assertion of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted 
our marine construction services segment may be particularly susceptible to regional conditions that may adversely affect its operations 
its major marine construction vessels typically require relatively long periods of time to mobilize over long distances  which could affect our ability to withdraw them from areas of conflict 
additionally  various foreign jurisdictions have laws limiting the right and ability of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies 
our international operations sometimes face the additional risks of fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange 
our operations are subject to operating risks and limits on insurance coverage  which could expose us to potentially significant liability costs 
we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our operations  including accidents resulting in injury to or the loss of life or property  environmental or toxic tort claims  including delayed manifestation claims for personal injury or loss of life  pollution or other environmental mishaps  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failures  collisions  property losses  business interruption due to political action in foreign countries  and labor stoppages 
we have been  and in the future we may be  named as defendants in lawsuits asserting large claims as a result of litigation arising from events such as these 
insurance against some of the risks inherent in our operations is either 
table of contents unavailable or available only at rates that we consider uneconomical 
this has particularly been the case following the september  terrorist attacks in new york city and washington  dc  which led to significant changes in various insurance markets  including decreased coverage limits  more limited coverage  additional exclusions in coverage  increased premium costs  and increased deductibles and self insured retentions 
these changes were in addition to similar changes we had seen in certain markets prior to september  risks that are difficult to insure include  among others  the risk of war and confiscation of property in some areas of the world  losses or liability resulting from acts of terrorism  certain risks relating to construction  and pollution liability 
depending on competitive conditions and other factors  we endeavor to obtain contractual protection against uninsured risks from our customers 
when obtained  such contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases be supported by adequate insurance maintained by the customer 
such insurance or contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
a successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on us 
bwxt  through two of its dedicated limited liability companies  has management and operating agreements with the us government for the y and the pantex facilities 
most insurable liabilities arising from these sites are not protected in our corporate insurance program but rely on government contractual agreements and certain specialized self insurance programs funded by the us government 
the us government has historically fulfilled its contractual agreement to reimburse for insurable claims and we expect it to continue this process during our administration of these two facilities 
however  it should be noted that  in most situations  the u 
s 
government is contractually obligated to pay  subject to the availability of authorized government funds 
we have captive insurers which provide certain coverages for our subsidiary entities and related coverages 
claims as a result of our operations  or arising in the b w chapter proceedings  could adversely impact the ability of these captive insurers to respond to all claims presented  although we believe such a result is unlikely 
in addition  if the proposed settlement in the bankruptcy proceedings involving b w is finalized  mii and its subsidiaries will assign to a trust formed in connection with the settlement their rights to insurance coverages that have substantial available limits of coverage for  among other things  asbestos related personal injury claims 
as a result  these insurance rights would no longer be available to mii and its subsidiaries to address any future claims against them  including any future asbestos related personal injury claims against them 
we depend on significant customers  including the us government 
our marine construction services and government operations segments derive a significant amount of their revenues and profits from a small number of customers 
the inability of these segments to continue to perform services for a number of their large existing customers  if not offset by contracts with new or other existing customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
our significant customers include state and federal government agencies and utilities 
in particular  our government operations segment derives substantially all its revenue from the us government 
some of our large multiyear contracts with the us government are subject to annual funding determinations 
state and us government budget restraints and other factors affecting these governments may adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
most industry segments in which we operate are highly competitive 
some of our competitors or potential competitors have greater financial or other resources than we have 
our operations may be adversely affected if our current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products or services with better features  performance  prices or other characteristics than those of our products and services 
this is significant to our marine construction services business  where capital investment is becoming critical to our ability to compete 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel  or our failure to attract  assimilate and retain trained personnel in the future  could disrupt our operations and result in loss of revenues 
our success depends on the continued active participation of our executive officers and key operating personnel 
the loss of the services of any one of these persons could adversely affect our operations 

table of contents our operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to obtain the proper operational results 
as a result  our operations depend  to a considerable extent  on the continuing availability of such personnel 
if we should suffer any material loss of personnel to competitors or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment  our operations could be adversely affected 
while we believe our wage rates are competitive and our relationships with our employees are satisfactory  a significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce  increases in wage rates  or both 
if either of these events occurred for a significant period of time  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
a substantial number of our employees are members of labor unions 
although we expect to renew our union contracts without incident  if we are unable to negotiate acceptable new contracts with our unions in the future  we could experience strikes or other work stoppages by the affected employees  and new contracts could result in increased operating costs attributable to both union and non union employees 
if any such strikes or other work stoppages were to occur  or if our other employees were to become represented by unions  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs 
we are subject to government regulations that may adversely affect our future operations 
many aspects of our operations and properties are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations  including those relating to construction and equipping of production platforms and other marine facilities  marine vessel safety  currency conversions and repatriation  oil exploration and development  taxation of foreign earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  and use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors 
in addition  our marine construction services segment depends on the demand for its services from the oil and gas industry and  therefore  is affected by changing taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally 
the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect the operations of our marine construction services segment by limiting the demand for its services 
we cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations 
environmental laws and regulations and civil liability for contamination of the environment or related personal injuries may result in increases in our operating costs and capital expenditures and decreases in our earnings and cash flow 
governmental requirements relating to the protection of the environment  including solid waste management  air quality  water quality  the decontamination and decommissioning of former nuclear manufacturing and processing facilities and cleanup of contaminated sites  have had a substantial impact on our operations 
these requirements are complex and subject to frequent change 
in some cases  they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
our compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate 
such expenditures and liabilities may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see section h above for further information 
in addition  some of our operations and the operations of predecessor owners of some of our properties have exposed us to civil claims by third parties for liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
for a discussion of civil proceedings of this nature in which we are currently involved  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents our internal controls may not be sufficient to achieve all stated goals and objectives 
our internal controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures  which  by their nature  can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives 
you should note that the design of any system of internal controls and procedures is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
we are subject to other risks including legal proceedings that we discuss in other sections of this annual report

c a u t i o n a r y s t a t e m e n t c o n c e r n i n g f o r w a r d l o o k i n g s t a t e m e n t s we are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords 
from time to time  our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our company 
these statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future backlog  revenues  income and capital spending 
forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate  project  predict  believe  expect  anticipate  plan  goal or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
in addition  sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement 
in addition  various statements in this annual report on form k  including those that express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements 
those forward looking statements appear in items and business and properties in part i of this report and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report and elsewhere in this report 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report  we disclaim any obligation to update these statements unless required by securities law  and we caution you not to rely on them unduly 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events 
while our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable  they are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive  regulatory and other risks  contingencies and uncertainties  most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
these risks  contingencies and uncertainties relate to  among other matters  the following general economic and business conditions and industry trends  general developments in the industries in which we are involved  decisions about offshore developments to be made by oil and gas companies  the highly competitive nature of our businesses  our future financial performance  including compliance with covenants in our credit agreements and other debt instruments  and availability  terms and deployment of capital  the continued availability of qualified personnel  the operating risks normally incident to offshore marine construction operations  
table of contents changes in  or our failure or inability to comply with  government regulations and adverse outcomes from legal and regulatory proceedings  estimates for pending and future nonemployee asbestos claims against b w and potential adverse developments that may occur in the chapter reorganization proceedings and the related proposed settlement involving b w and certain of its subsidiaries and mii  the ultimate resolution of the appeals from the ruling issued by the bankruptcy court on february   which found b w solvent at the time of a corporate reorganization completed in the fiscal year ended march  and the related ruling issued on april   the potential impact on available insurance due to bankruptcy filings by asbestos troubled companies  the potential impact on our captive insurance subsidiaries of b w asbestos related claims under policies issued by those subsidiaries  changes in  and liabilities relating to  existing or future environmental regulatory matters  rapid technological changes  realization of deferred tax assets  consequences of significant changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates  difficulties we may encounter in obtaining regulatory or other necessary approvals of any strategic transactions  social  political and economic situations in foreign countries where we do business  including  among others  countries in the middle east and asia pacific  and the former soviet union  the possibilities of war  other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks  effects of asserted and unasserted claims  our ability to obtain surety bonds and letters of credit  the continued ability of our insurers to reimburse us for payments made to asbestos claimants  and our ability to maintain builder s risk  liability and property insurance in amounts we consider adequate at rates that we consider economical 
we believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause estimates in our financial statements to differ materially from actual results and those expressed in a forward looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf 
we have discussed many of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this report 
these factors are not necessarily all the important factors that could affect us 
unpredictable or unknown factors we have not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward looking statements 
we do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises  except as required by applicable securities laws and regulations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical fact  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings risk factors and cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in items and of part i of this report 
g e n e ra l in general  our business segments are composed of capital intensive businesses that rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of their revenues 
each of our business segments has been capitalized and is financed on a stand alone basis 
our debt covenants generally preclude using the financial resources or the movement of excess cash from one segment for the benefit of the other 
our marine construction services segment incurred operating losses in and which substantially strained its liquidity 
liquidity available to our other segment  government operations  is not available to satisfy the needs of our marine construction services segment 
for further discussion  see liquidity and capital resources  below 
beginning in  qualified pension plan expense on mi s pension plan will be allocated to our government operations segment from unallocated corporate 
we expect this allocation will be approximately million 
in  approximately million of pension expense related to bwxt substantially all of our government operations segment was recorded in unallocated corporate 
in addition  effective january  the b w portion of mi s qualified pension plan has been spun off into a new plan sponsored by b w 
in  pension expense associated with the spun off plan was recorded in unallocated corporate and totaled approximately million 
because of these two changes  we expect pension expense in unallocated corporate to be approximately million in marine construction services segment recent operating results and outlook in  jrm successfully implemented certain plans to address its liquidity issues and  as a result  we believe there is no longer substantial doubt about jrm s ability to continue as a going concern through our forecast period 
in addition  in  jrm addressed these issues by improving controls and procedures throughout the bidding  contracting and project management process and made several changes in operating management personnel 
as a result of these actions  our management has concluded that jrm no longer has a material weakness as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  in its ability to forecast accurately estimated total costs to complete fixed priced contracts until all major phases of the work are completed 
our operating results for the years ended december  and were adversely affected by material losses on several large marine construction contracts  including the contracts related to three spar projects  medusa  devils 
table of contents tower and front runner  the carina aries project off the coast of argentina  and the belanak fpso project on batam island 
each of these projects had significant first of a kind aspects 
jrm entered into the contracts for each of these projects on a fixed price basis 
we recorded losses of million during and million during on the three spar projects 
during  we also recorded estimated losses of million on the carina aries project and million on the belanak fpso project 
we recorded approximately million in recoveries and productivity improvements on these contracts in our income statement during the year ended december  however  we may continue to incur cash outflows on certain of these projects primarily due to the cost overruns recorded in the three spar projects have been delivered to the respective customers 
the front runner spar has ongoing exposure to potential warranty claims from the customer until expiration of the warranty period in august we have accrued warranty reserves which we believe are adequate to cover all known and likely warranty claims at this time 
however  our experience with respect to spar warranties is limited  and it is possible that actual warranty claims will exceed the amounts we have provided for at december  the primary issue remaining related to medusa is resolution of a dispute with a subcontractor  bay ltd 
the one year warranty period on medusa expired on august  in the year ended december   we recorded charges totaling approximately million related to the medusa project 
a substantial portion of the costs and delay impacts on devils tower was attributable to remedial activities undertaken with regard to the paint supplied 
on march   we filed an action against the paint supplier and certain of its related parties for recovery of the remediation costs  delays and other damages 
we received a certificate of final completion from our customer on this project in april in the year ended december   we recorded favorable contract adjustments on devils tower totaling approximately million  primarily attributable to change orders approved during the period and an insurance recovery of costs incurred on pile related issues 
remaining issues include a dispute with the subcontractor  bay ltd 
the claims between jrm and bay  ltd 
arising from the construction of devils tower have been set for arbitration on may  the one year warranty period on devils tower expired on february  we completed and handed over front runner  receiving acceptance from the customer on august  in the year ended december   we recorded favorable contract adjustments on front runner totaling approximately million  primarily attributable to a change order for offshore work  reductions in cost estimates for work completed during the period and reduced exposure to schedule related liquidated damages 
the one year warranty period on front runner will expire on august  with regard to the carina aries project  we provided for our best estimate of the total cost to achieve project completion and recorded losses totaling million during the year ended december  we completed the pipeline work in march and topsides installation in may all remaining work necessary to obtain the customer s acceptance is now complete 
in the year ended december   we recorded favorable contract adjustments on carina aries totaling approximately million  primarily attributable to reduced cost estimates for the offshore work completed during the period  insurance recoveries  and reduced fees for letters of credit associated with the project 
remaining issues include ongoing exposure to potential warranty claims from the customer during the warranty period  which will begin when we obtain provisional acceptance from the customer 
the belanak fpso project involved a subcontract to jrm for the fabrication of topsides for an fpso in indonesia 
during the year ended december   we provided for our best estimate of the total cost to achieve project completion and recorded losses totaling million 
increases in cost were attributable to overruns of the material and subcontractor cost estimates  as well as labor costs to complete 
in the year ended december   we recorded favorable contract adjustments on belanak totaling approximately million  primarily attributable to reduced cost estimates as a result of productivity improvements  revenue increases  as well as reduced exposure to liquidated damages 
schedule extensions to dates related to liquidated damages have been agreed with the customer and the jrm portion of the project is complete 
the belanak fpso sailed on october  as of december   in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  we have provided for our estimated costs to complete all our ongoing contracts 
however  it is possible that current estimates 
table of contents could change due to unforeseen events  which could result in adjustments to overall contract costs 
the risk on fixed priced contracts is that revenue from the customer does not rise to cover increases in our costs 
it is possible that current estimates could materially change for various reasons including  but not limited to fluctuations in forecasted labor productivity  pipeline lay rates  or steel and other raw material prices 
increases in costs on our fixed price contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
alternatively  reductions in overall contract costs at completion could materially improve our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
at december   jrm had approximately million in accounts and notes receivable due from one of its joint ventures in mexico and expects to generate revenues and cash flows in from the charter of two of its vessels to this venture 
the note receivable is attributable to the sale of jrm s db vessel during the quarter ended september  in addition  jrm also had approximately million in currency translation losses associated with this joint venture in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  this joint venture is experiencing liquidity problems attributable to tax assessment issues and potential consequential damages due to cancellation of a contract with its major customer 
while this joint venture is current on its obligations to jrm  it is possible that jrm could experience delays in collection of and ultimate realization of its receivables from this joint venture 
recognition of a gain of approximately million on the sale of the db is currently being deferred 
the amount of revenues our marine construction services segment generates largely depends on the level of oil and gas development activity in the world s major hydrocarbon producing regions 
numerous factors influence this activity  including oil and gas prices  along with expectations about future prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the terms and conditions of offshore leases  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  reserve depletion and replacement rates  technological barriers or advances  socio political drivers in developing countries  the ability of businesses in the oil and gas industry to raise capital  and local and international political and economic conditions 
the decision making process for oil and gas companies in making capital expenditures on marine construction services for a development project differs depending on whether the project involves new or existing development 
in the case of new development projects  the demand for marine construction services generally follows the exploratory drilling and  in some cases  initial development drilling activities 
based on the results of these activities and evaluations of field economics  customers determine whether to install new platforms and new infrastructure  such as subsea gathering lines and pipelines 
for existing development projects  demand for marine construction services is generated by decisions to  among other things  expand development in existing fields and expand existing infrastructure 
due to the deterioration in jrm s financial performance during the year ended december   we revised our expectations concerning jrm s future earnings and cash flow and tested the goodwill of our marine construction services segment for impairment 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million  which was the total amount of jrm s goodwill 
government operations segment recent operating results and outlook the revenues of our government operations segment are largely a function of capital spending by the us government 
as a supplier of major nuclear components for certain us government programs  bwxt is a significant participant in the defense industry 
the strong bookings in our government operations segment continued during allowing us to maintain a healthy backlog 
additionally  with bwxt s unique capability of full life cycle management of special nuclear materials  facilities and technologies  bwxt is well positioned to continue to participate in the continuing cleanup and management of the department of energy s nuclear sites and weapons complexes 

table of contents bwxt is expected to continue producing strong financial results 
its backlog of approximately billion is expected to produce revenues for of approximately million  not including any new contracts that may be awarded during the year 
bwxt s commitment to cost containment  in addition to the potential for new service contract awards  leads management to believe operating results should remain consistent with levels  on a comparable basis 
beginning in  we will allocate the pension expense which in previous years was recorded in unallocated corporate to our government operations segment 
we anticipate the allocated expense for will be approximately million 
other the results of menck gmbh menck  previously a component of our marine construction services segment  and the results of hudson products corporation hpc  are reported in discontinued operations 
we sold menck in august and hpc in july see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information on discontinued operations 
the results of operations of our power generation systems segment include primarily the results of volund  which we sold to b w on october  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for information concerning that sale 
as a result of the chapter reorganization proceedings involving b w and several of its subsidiaries  we stopped consolidating the results of operations of b w and its subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements and began presenting our investment in b w on the cost method 
during the year ended december   due to increased uncertainty with respect to the amounts  means and timing of the ultimate settlement of b w asbestos claims and the recovery of our investment in b w  we wrote off our net investment in b w 
the total impairment charge of million included our investment in b w of million and other related assets totaling million  primarily consisting of accounts receivable from b w 
on december   drafts of a joint plan of reorganization and settlement agreement  together with a draft of a related disclosure statement  were filed in the chapter proceedings  and we determined that a liability related to the proposed settlement was probable and that the value was reasonably estimable 
accordingly  as of december   we established an estimate for the cost of the settlement of the b w bankruptcy proceedings of million  including related tax expense of million 
as of december   we have updated our estimated cost of the proposed settlement to reflect current conditions  and for the year ended december  we recorded an aggregate increase in the provision of million  including associated tax expense of million 
the proposed settlement contemplates  among other things  the issuance of shares of our common stock to an asbestos personal injury settlement trust  and the increase in the provision for the cost of the proposed settlement is primarily due to an increase in our stock price 
as of december   our estimate for the cost of the proposed settlement is million 
at a special meeting of our shareholders on december   our shareholders voted on and approved a resolution relating to a proposed settlement that would resolve the b w chapter proceedings 
the shareholders approval of the resolution is conditioned on the subsequent approval of the proposed settlement by mii s board of directors the board 
we would become bound to the settlement only when the plan of reorganization becomes effective  and the plan of reorganization cannot become effective without the approval of the board within days prior to the effective time of the plan 
the board s decision on whether to approve the proposed settlement will be made after consideration of any developments that might occur prior to the effective date  including any changes in the status of any potential federal legislation concerning asbestos liabilities  including the fairness in asbestos injury resolution fair act of the asbestos personal injury claimants have voted in favor of the proposed b w plan of reorganization 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for details regarding the estimated cost of the proposed settlement and for further information regarding developments in negotiations relating to the b w chapter proceedings 
at december   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we decreased our minimum pension liability by approximately million primarily due to the improvement in financial markets in effective january   the assets and liabilities associated with b w s portion of the mi pension plan were spun off into a b w sponsored plan 

table of contents approximately of the employees in the mi pension plan at january  were transferred to the new b w sponsored plan 
effective december   benefit accruals under the mcdermott international  inc supplemental executive retirement plan  amended and restated effective december  the old serp plan ceased and we adopted the mcdermott international  inc supplemental executive retirement plan effective january  the new serp plan 
the old serp plan is a defined benefit plan  while the new serp plan is a defined contribution plan 
the cessation of benefits of the old serp plan did not affect the rights of retired or disabled participants or their spouses who were receiving benefits under the plan as of december  however  some of the retired participants elected to receive a discounted lump sum distribution in lieu of any future entitlements under the old serp plan 
all active participants in the old serp plan on december  became participants in the new serp plan on january  we recorded a settlement and curtailment gain of approximately million in connection with the cessation of benefits 
we also recorded expenses related to the new serp plan of approximately million in the year ended december  as a result of our reorganization in  which we completed through a transaction commonly referred to as an inversion  our company is a corporation organized under the laws of the republic of panama 
in prior years  the us house and senate have considered legislation that would change the tax law applicable to corporations that have completed inversion transactions 
we entered into an agreement with two shareholders pursuant to which management will sponsor and recommend a proposal for re domestication in the proxy statement for the annual meeting in the event the tax  costs and other considerations impacted by re domestication are determined by our board of directors to be in the best interests of our shareholders 
in the event that re domestication is determined by our board of directors not to be in the best interests of our shareholders  pursuant to our agreement described in this paragraph  management will present the re domestication proposal on the proxy but may recommend against it 
the timing of any such management proposal is contingent upon the completion of the b w reorganization proceedings 
effective january   based on a review performed by us and independent consultants we engaged  we changed our estimate of the useful lives of new major marine vessels from years to years to better reflect the service lives of our assets and industry norms 
consistent with this change  we also extended the estimated useful lives of major upgrades to existing vessels 
we continue to depreciate our major marine vessels using the units of production method  based on the utilization of each vessel 
the change in estimated useful lives reduced our operating loss and net loss by approximately million for the year ended december  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from foreign operations 
as a result  international factors  including variations in local economies and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  affect our revenues and operating results 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates by attempting to match anticipated foreign currency contract receipts with like foreign currency disbursements 
to the extent that we are unable to match the foreign currency receipts and disbursements related to our contracts  we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our operating results 
because we generally do not hedge beyond our exposure  we believe this practice minimizes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our operating results 
c r i t i c a l a c c o u n t i n g p o l i c i e s a n d e s t i m a t e s we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that we apply in the preparation of our financial statements 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
restricted cash 
we record cash as restricted when we are unable to use such cash and cash equivalents freely for general operating purposes 
our long term restricted cash and cash equivalents are those funds we expect to use to finance capital expenditures at jrm  funds required to be offered to holders of the jrm secured notes before restrictions are released and those funds securing jrm letter of credit obligations having expiration dates beyond one year from our balance sheet date 
contracts and revenue recognition 
we determine the appropriate accounting method for each of our long term contracts when work on the project begins 
we generally recognize contract revenues and related costs on a percentage of completion method for individual contracts or combinations of contracts under the guidelines of the statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
this is based on our experience and history of being able to prepare reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
under this method  we recognize estimated contract revenue and resulting income based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
total estimated costs  and resulting contract income  are affected by changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors 
additionally  external factors such as weather  customer requirements and other factors outside of our control  may affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of revenue and income recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts  and revisions to profitability are reflected in the quarterly and annual earnings we report 
as discussed in more detail below  sop provides that the use of percentage of completion accounting requires the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates 
we had significant adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates on the medusa  devils tower and front runner spars  the carina aries  and the belanak fpso projects 
each of those projects involved a long term  fixed price contract 
the medusa spar  devils tower spar and carina aries projects started in the other two projects  the front runner spar and belanak fpso commenced in the first quarter of as a result of significant operational issues and other factors that negatively impacted our performance on these contracts  we were unable to forecast accurately the total cost to complete these projects until we performed almost all of their major phases 
this led to the material weakness determination from our auditors citing our inability to accurately estimate the cost to complete these types of contracts 
in their letter to us  our auditors recommended implementation of a common  comprehensive project management framework  the lack of which impacted our ability to accurately estimate the cost to complete these contracts and constituted a material weakness as defined in au  communication of internal control related matters noted in an audit 
as we discuss below  we have implemented various policies and procedures designed to eliminate this material weakness and  as of december   based on an evaluation of our internal controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act  our management concluded that there was no material weakness in our ability to estimate cost to complete 
our management has also determined that  while giving appropriate consideration to the requirement of reasonably dependable estimates as a condition to the application of the percentage of completion method  and notwithstanding the prior existence of the material weakness noted above  the percentage of completion method was the appropriate method for us to use to account for our results under these five contracts 
at the inception of work on each of the projects under the five contracts referred to above  our decision to use the percentage of completion method rather than the completed contract method was based on our belief that we had reasonably dependable cost estimates at the time work on the projects started 
at project inception  we had previous experience in performing and or pricing their work scopes 
prior to submitting the medusa bid  we had participated in the topsides fabrication and offshore installation parts of four spar projects the neptune  genesis  nansen  and boomvang spars we had also completed the typhoon tension leg platform  which included fabrication of a tubular hull in our morgan city yard 
while the hull was smaller in size than the medusa  devils tower  and front runner tubular hulls  it did provide us with direct experience on the cost to build tubular hulls 
we also had information concerning the costs our unrelated joint venture partner experienced to fabricate the tubular hulls for the genesis  nansen  and boomvang spars 
we were informed that our price on medusa was within of the high losing bid on medusa  giving us another benchmark for the reasonableness of our cost estimate as of the time work on the project started 
our price for devils tower was increased based on our experience relating to the cost over runs on medusa 
in addition  we increased our price on front runner based upon our experience with our devils tower costs 
the carina aries project was for the fabrication of two jackets and decks along with pipeline work 
we have many years of experience fabricating jackets and decks of similar size  as well as substantial experience as a pipelay contractor 
we used the information we developed from this experience  as well as price quotes from four independent fabrication yards  to estimate the fabrication cost 
we used our substantial experience in laying pipe under harsh conditions in the north china sea  as well as the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea to estimate our cost to complete the pipeline scope 
the cost estimate for the belanak fpso reflected our 
table of contents experiences with the foinaven fpso fabricated in europe  as well as the jamestown fpso fabricated in the united states 
we used these factors to support the reasonableness of our cost estimates when these projects started and account for them under the percentage of completion method 
there were  however  significant first of a kind aspects to each of these projects 
the medusa hull was the first spar hull we have ever fabricated  and its topsides the first we fabricated in our veracruz harbor island facilities 
the devils tower hull was the first fabricated in our batam island facility 
the front runner topsides were the first spar topsides we subcontracted to a third party 
the carina aries pipeline was the first we laid in southern argentina 
the belanak fpso was much larger in size than topsides previously fabricated in our batam island facility 
based on a consideration weighing of all these factors  we believe that we had reasonably dependable cost estimates at the start of each of these projects 
as we noted above  we had significant adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to our contract estimates relating to these projects in   and these adjustments were  in large measure  attributable to operational issues we encountered in the course of performance under the contracts 
although some of these issues arose from the first of a kind aspects referred to above  other issues were attributable to poor project performance and oversight  including poor performance by subcontractors and by our personnel in facilities that were being overloaded with work and staffed by laborers and other personnel who  in many cases  were inexperienced 
in addition  vendor supplied lead paint and a storm off the southern coast of argentina in june of  contributed to substantial cost overruns on two of these projects 
the material weakness in estimating cost to complete identified by our independent auditors reflected concern over the lack of a common  comprehensive project management framework to permit us to recognize and assess these operational issues relating to these large  fixed priced contracts  and to factor those assessments into our overall estimates of contract profitability 
however  due to the additional procedures and analyses which we implemented as the performance issues arose under the contracts and which effectively compensated for the lack of a comprehensive project management framework  we believe that our estimates with respect to these five contracts for each reporting period during the years through were reasonable at the times they were made 
as indicated above  continuing operational issues and many factors beyond our control caused actual results under these contracts to deteriorate from the estimated results 
we have carefully considered the reasons for that deterioration and the accounting guidance provided by sop and confirmed that the percentage of completion method was the appropriate method for us to use to account for our operations under these five contracts 
in response to the difficulties encountered on these five large contracts  we implemented a number of policies and procedures in  including a procedure requiring review and approval of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and general counsel for all jrm contracts over million 
additionally  all contracts  irrespective of their value  that have significant first of a kind aspects  such as new products  new geographic locations or work  and scope of work which we have never attempted  must be approved by the same officers 
since inception of the procedure  no contracts with significant first of a kind aspects have been approved 
jrm has now installed common project control software to provide more prompt and accurate reporting of the status of each element of the work on a time effective basis and has established a global project management division 
jrm s new project risk opportunity management prom system was developed and is applied to every contract over million 
the prom system assists our management in identifying and ranks risks and opportunities in each project  analyzing jrm s capability to manage the risks  estimating the contingency amount to be added to jrm s bid price to cover the risk  developing a risk management mitigation action plan for each high priority risk  and developing a management plan to maximize realization of opportunities 
in addition  jrm now requires comprehensive monthly health of the project reports and reviews for all contracts that have projected revenues over million 
part of these reviews focus on the realization or mitigation of the risks identified by the prom system 
jrm has also instituted quarterly project certifications 
table of contents to be executed by project managers and local management attesting to the accuracy of the reported progress and forecast cost to complete all high risk projects over million 
jrm has instituted a global lessons learned website to share knowledge throughout its worldwide operations 
it also has instituted a change management tracking system to capture timely change order information and obtain timely agreements from customers 
global procurement  subcontracting  construction  project management  and risk management controls have been instituted and are administered by the jrm vice president of project management and his staff  a group created in in response to jrm s experience with the five projects discussed above 
as a result of these changes  we have determined that as of december   jrm no longer has a material weakness relating to estimates of costs to complete contracts 
for contracts as to which we are unable to estimate the final profitability except to assure that no loss will ultimately be incurred  we recognize equal amounts of revenue and cost until the final results can be estimated more precisely 
for these deferred profit recognition contracts  we recognize revenue and cost equally and only recognize gross margin when probable and reasonably estimable  which we generally determine to be when the contract is approximately complete 
we treat long term construction contracts that contain such a level of risk and uncertainty that estimation of the final outcome is impractical except to assure that no loss will be incurred  as deferred profit recognition contracts 
we currently have one contract being accounted for under our deferred profit recognition basis  jrm s contract to build offshore platform complexes for the dolphin upstream facilities 
this project  which is on schedule  is approximately complete as of december   and we have deferred approximately million in gross profit on this project 
the major risk on this project which arose after we had bid the contract but before we started work  was escalation in the prices of steel and steel based products we are required to purchase 
we are reasonably confident  based on our detailed project reviews to date which show that we have firm price commitments for over of the value of our required purchases  our improved risk management procedures on long term contracts  and our recently updated forecast concerning cost estimates  that no loss will be incurred on this contract 
however  as discussed above  it is possible that unforeseen events or circumstances beyond our control could materially affect the total estimated cost of this project 
fixed price contracts are required to be accounted for under the completed contract method if we are unable to reasonably forecast cost to complete at start up 
for example  if we have no experience in performing the type of work on a particular project and were unable to develop reasonably dependable estimates of total costs to complete  we would follow the completed contract method of accounting for such projects 
our management s policy is not to enter into fixed price contracts without an accurate estimate of cost to complete 
however  it is possible that in the time between contract execution and the start of work on a project  we could lose confidence in our ability to forecast cost to complete based on intervening events  including but not limited to experience on similar projects  civil unrest  strikes and volatility in our expected costs 
in such a situation  we would use the completed contract method of accounting for that project 
no such contracts were executed by jrm in and our estimating weakness was corrected as of december  for all contracts  if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
although we continually strive to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs due to unforeseen events may continue to be significant in future periods 
we recognize claims for extra work or for changes in scope of work in contract revenues  to the extent of costs incurred  when we believe collection is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we recognize income from contract change orders or claims when formally agreed with the customer 
we reflect any amounts not collected as an adjustment to earnings 
we regularly assess the collectibility of contract revenues and receivables from customers 
property  plant and equipment 
we carry our property  plant and equipment at depreciated cost  reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment when we determine impairment has occurred 
factors that impact our determination of impairment include forecasted utilization of equipment and estimates of cash flow from projects to be performed in future periods 
our estimates of cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
any changes in such factors may negatively affect our business segments and result in future asset impairments 
except for major marine vessels  we depreciate our property  plant and equipment using the straight line method  over estimated economic useful lives of eight to years for buildings and two to years for machinery and equipment 
we depreciate major marine vessels using the units of production method based on the utilization of each vessel 
effective january   based on a review performed by us and independent consultants we engaged  we changed our estimate of the useful lives of new major marine vessels from years to years 
our depreciation expense calculated under the units of production method may be less than  equal to or greater than depreciation expense calculated under the straight line method in any period 
the annual depreciation based on utilization of each vessel will not be less than the greater of of annual straight line depreciation and of cumulative straight line depreciation 
we expense the costs of maintenance  repairs and renewals  which do not materially prolong the useful life of an asset  as we incur them  except for drydocking costs 
we accrue estimated drydocking costs for our marine fleet over the period of time between drydockings  generally three to five years 
we accrue drydocking costs in advance of the anticipated future drydocking  commonly known as the accrue in advance method 
we charge actual drydocking costs against the liability when incurred  and we recognize any differences between actual costs and accrued costs over the remaining months of the drydocking cycle 
our actual drydocking costs often differ from our estimates due to the long period between drydockings and the inherent difficulties in estimating cost of vessel repairs and renewals until the drydocking occurs 

table of contents self insurance 
we have several wholly owned insurance subsidiaries that provide general and automotive liability and workers compensation insurance and from time to time  builder s risk within certain limits  and marine hull to our companies 
reserves related to these insurance programs are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
we maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self insurance retentions for the coverage s discussed above 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted as required based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
these loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
pension plans and postretirement benefits 
we estimate income or expense related to our pension and postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial assumptions  including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we determine our discount rate based on a review of published financial data and discussions with our actuary regarding rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of our pension obligations 
based on historical data and discussions with our actuary  we determine our expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets and the market related value of our plan assets 
changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in our estimated pension income or expense 
we revise our assumptions on an annual basis based upon changes in current interest rates  return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of our workforce 
these assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings 
effective march   participation and benefits for the jrm pension plan were frozen 
as a result  we recorded a curtailment gain totaling approximately million in other net for the year ended december  loss contingencies 
we estimate liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision or if such loss is not reasonably estimable 
we are currently involved in some investigations and litigation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have accrued our estimates of the probable losses associated with these matters 
however  our losses are typically resolved over long periods of time and are often difficult to estimate due to the possibility of multiple actions by third parties 
therefore  it is possible future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates related to these matters 
our most significant loss contingencies include our estimate of the cost of the potential settlement of the b w chapter proceedings  which is now dependent on the finalization of the proposed settlement discussed in this report see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead perform periodic testing for impairment 
it requires a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss 
the first step of the test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
both steps of goodwill impairment testing involve significant estimates 
we wrote off million  which represented all of jrm s goodwill  in as a result  our total goodwill has been substantially reduced 
asset retirement obligations and environmental clean up costs 
we accrue for future decommissioning of our nuclear facilities that will permit the release of these facilities to unrestricted use at the end of each facility s life  which is a requirement of our licenses from the nuclear regulatory commission 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requiring us to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when we initially record such a liability  we capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of a liability  we will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss 
sfas no 
applies to environmental liabilities associated with assets that we currently operate and are obligated to remove from service 
for environmental liabilities associated with assets that we no longer operate  we have accrued amounts based on the estimated costs of clean up activities  net of any cost sharing arrangements 
we adjust the estimated costs as further 
table of contents information develops or circumstances change 
an exception to this accounting treatment relates to the work we perform for one facility  for which the us government is obligated to pay all the decommissioning costs 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we believe that the deferred tax asset recorded as of december  is realizable through carrybacks  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
if we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made 
we will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
any changes to our estimated valuation allowance could be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
warranty 
in our marine construction services segment  we include warranty costs as a component of our total contract cost estimate to satisfy contractual requirements 
in addition  we make specific provisions where we expect the actual warranty costs to significantly exceed the accrued estimates 
in our marine construction services segment  warranty periods are generally limited  and we have had minimal warranty cost in prior years 
factors that impact our estimate of warranty costs include prior history of warranty claims and our estimates of future costs of materials and labor 
in our government operations segment  we accrue estimated expenses to satisfy contractual warranty requirements when we recognize the associated revenue on the related contracts 
our future warranty provisions may vary from what we have experienced in the past 
for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
y e a r e n d e d d e c e m b e r  c o m p a r e d t o y e a r e n d e d d e c e m b e r  m a r i n e c o n s t r u c t i o n s e r v i c e s revenues decreased to billion  primarily due to reduced activity in southeast asia  which resulted in lower revenues of approximately million  and lower activity on spar projects and the carina aries project off the coast of southern argentina  which resulted in lower revenues of approximately million 
the lower activity on spar projects was due to completion of the medusa spar in august and the devils tower spar in february  and lower activity on the carina aries project was due to that project having been substantially complete at the end of march that reduced activity was partially offset by increased activity on topsides fabrication and pipeline installation projects in the azerbaijan sector of the caspian sea  which resulted in increased revenues of approximately million 
segment operating income  which is before equity in income of investees  increased million to million 
this increase resulted primarily from improvements on the spar projects and the carina aries project and reversal of drydock reserves of million due to the sale of a vessel  partially offset by lower fabrication activity in all our facilities and lower marine installation activity worldwide  as well as increased general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december  we recorded favorable adjustments to loss estimates as a result of favorable productivity and change order settlements on the spar projects  the carina aries project and the belanak fpso project totaling million  compared to charges totaling million in the year ended december  we also realized increased operating profits of million in the caspian sea region during the year ended december  due to higher revenues and improved margins 
the lower fabrication activity and the lower marine activity in the year ended december  resulted in declines of million and million  respectively  compared to the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  primarily due to increased sales and proposals expense and increased regulatory compliance expense attributable to jrm s compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we record our costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act in our respective segments 
higher premiums for officers and directors insurance  increased costs associated with treasury and financial systems and increased oversight efforts related to project controls and project management and increased sales and marketing expenses also contributed to increased general and administrative expense

under this policy  the profit on the project  which was approximately million at december   will be deferred until the project is approximately complete and we are confident of our cost estimate to complete  which is expected to be by the end of revenues on this project totaled approximately million in government operations revenues increased million to million  primarily due to higher volumes from the manufacture of nuclear components for certain us government programs  our commercial nuclear environmental services  one of our management and operating contracts  and our other government operations due to additional uranium recovery and fuel fabrication work 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from our commercial work

in  mi will allocate to bwxt its share of qualified pension plan expense  which we expect to be approximately million 
equity in income from investees increased million to million  primarily due to increased operating results from joint ventures in tennessee  idaho  and texas 
corporate unallocated corporate expenses decreased million to million  primarily due to the gain we recognized in the fourth quarter on the settlement of our pension plan in the united kingdom totaling million  a million reduction in qualified pension plan expense from million in to million in and increased allocation of corporate costs to the operating segments 
the gain on the settlement of our pension plan was attributable to a change in estimate due to a ruling obtained from the taxing authorities in the quarter ending december of excise taxes owed on the settlement and favorable exchange rates 
we also had a gain on the settlement of our old serp plan 
these decreases were partially offset by higher expenses associated with our compliance requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of

table of contents government operations revenues decreased million to million  primarily due to lower volumes from our management and operating contract at the u

government owned facility in miamisburg  ohio 
we are no longer the prime contractor but are now a subcontractor for this site  and  as a result  we now record only our fee in revenues rather than the full revenues from the contract 
in addition  our research and development division reported lower revenues due to reassigning contracts out to their responsible divisions including b w and its subsidiaries as part of the decentralization of our research and development activities 
we also experienced lower revenues from our commercial work and other government operations  primarily due to an early lease buyout and the completion of a very profitable contract in the decreases in revenues were partially offset by revenues attributable to higher volumes from the manufacture of nuclear components for certain us government programs and our commercial nuclear environmental services 
in addition  we resolved two contract disputes favorably 
segment operating income  which is before equity income from investees  increased million to million  primarily due to higher volume and margins from the manufacture of nuclear components for certain us government programs 
in addition  we decreased spending on fuel cell research and development and  as mentioned above  we resolved two contract disputes favorably 
these increases in operating income were partially offset by lower volume and margins from our commercial work and from our other government operations 
in addition  we experienced higher general and administrative expenses due to increased facility management oversight costs and increased regulatory compliance costs 
we also experienced lower costs in the prior year due to the receipt of an insurance settlement relating to environmental restoration costs 
equity in income from investees increased million to million  primarily due to increased operating results from several of our joint ventures operating in idaho  louisiana  tennessee and texas 
corporate unallocated corporate expenses increased million to million  primarily due to higher qualified pension plan expenses as a result of changes in our discount rate and plan asset performance

the remaining items  consisting primarily of estimated benefits we expect to receive as a result of the proposed b w chapter settlement  constitute income in jurisdictions where we are subject to income taxation 
in addition  for the year ended december   we decreased our valuation allowance for the realization of deferred tax assets by million to million

cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  we capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  we will either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded income of approximately million as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
e f f e c t s o f i n f l a t i o n a n d c h a n g i n g p r i c e s our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  using historical us dollar accounting historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations  we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimate of those changes  which we reflect in the original price  or through price escalation clauses in our contracts 
l i q u i d i t y a n d c a p i t a l r e s o u r c e s as we disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as of december   there was substantial doubt about jrm s ability to continue as a going concern 
since december   we have implemented certain portions of our plan to address jrm s liquidity issues 
since december   the following items have improved jrm s liquidity jrm completed the sales of its db and oceanic vessels resulting in cash proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
the million amount is now unrestricted while the million amount continues to be restricted for capital expenditures through july in addition  jrm sold its inactive ardersier  scotland fabrication facility for approximately million 
see the discussion of asset sales below for additional details  jrm completed the spar projects and  as a result  a million temporary interest reserve has been released to unrestricted cash  the belanak fpso and carina aries projects are both substantially complete and  as a result  the risk of these projects negatively impacting jrm s liquidity has been significantly reduced  jrm completed a new million letter of credit facility that allowed for the release of approximately million of cash previously restricted as collateral for letters of credit  jrm has entered into an uncommitted credit facility with mii under which jrm can request up to million in loans from mii  subject to certain negotiated terms and conditions  through the date of this report  this facility has not been utilized  and jrm has implemented cost reductions and downsizing at certain of its facilities 

table of contents as a result of the successful completion of these items  we believe that jrm will fulfill its liquidity requirements throughout our forecast period and there is no longer substantial doubt concerning jrm s ability to continue as a going concern through our forecast period 
although jrm has improved its liquidity  various factors could have a negative impact on jrm s cash flows in the future  including the risk that jrm may be unable to increase backlog and reduce future costs and credit risks at one of jrm s mexican joint ventures  as described under general marine construction services segment recent operating results and outlook 
on december   we completed new financing arrangements for jrm and bwxt on a stand alone basis 
these financing arrangements included the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due by jrm the jrm secured notes and the entering into of a three year  million revolving credit facility by bwxt the bwxt credit facility 
the bwxt credit facility was increased to million in january concurrent with the new financing arrangements  we cancelled our million omnibus revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in april neither the jrm secured notes nor the bwxt credit facility is guaranteed by mii 
the jrm secured notes were issued in an original aggregate principal amount of million  mature on december  and bear interest at per annum  payable semiannually on each june and december  commencing june  these notes were issued at a discount  yielding proceeds to jrm of million before payment of approximately million in debt issuance costs 
the jrm secured notes are senior secured obligations of jrm and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of jrm 
on or after december   jrm may redeem some or all of the jrm secured notes at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
month period commencing december in year percentage and thereafter before december   jrm may redeem the jrm secured notes with the cash proceeds from public equity offerings by jrm at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes  subject to specified conditions 
jrm s obligations under the indenture relating to the jrm secured notes are unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by all subsidiaries that own a marine vessel that is or is required to become a mortgaged vessel under the terms of the indenture and related collateral agreements and all significant subsidiaries of jrm as defined in the indenture 
the jrm secured notes are secured by first priority liens  subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens  on capital stock of some of the subsidiary guarantors and specified major marine construction vessels owned by jrm and certain subsidiary guarantors 
the indenture relating to the jrm secured notes requires jrm to comply with various covenants that  among other things  restrict jrm s ability to incur additional debt or issue subsidiary preferred stock or stock with a mandatory redemption feature before the maturity of the notes  pay dividends on its capital stock  redeem or repurchase its capital stock  make some types of investments and sell assets  use proceeds from asset sales to fund working capital needs  create liens or engage in sale and leaseback transactions  engage in transactions with affiliates  except on an arm s length basis  and consolidate or merge with  or sell its assets substantially as an entirety to  another person 
the indenture also imposes various reporting obligations on jrm 

table of contents jrm is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete an offer to exchange the jrm secured notes for notes registered under the securities act 
jrm has not yet satisfied its exchange offer obligations and  therefore  effective june  is required to pay additional interest at a rate of per annum until it satisfies those obligations 
we expect jrm will satisfy its exchange offer obligations in the bwxt credit facility is a revolving credit agreement providing for borrowings and issuances of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to million for a three year term 
borrowings under the agreement may not exceed million 
the bwxt credit facility requires bwxt to comply with various financial and nonfinancial covenants and reporting requirements 
the financial covenants require bwxt to maintain a minimum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio 
bwxt was in compliance with these covenants at december  the interest rate at december  was 
commitment fees are charged at a per annum rate of  payable quarterly 
proceeds from the bwxt credit facility have been used to repay an intercompany loan from mii  to repay amounts owed by bwxt under the omnibus revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes of bwxt  its subsidiaries and joint ventures 
at december   bwxt had no borrowings outstanding and letters of credit outstanding under the facility totaled million 
in march  this facility was extended to march  in addition  certain covenants were modified which increases permitted acquisition to million over a twelve month period and increasing allowable unsecured debt to million 
as a result of improved operations and asset sales  jrm experienced positive cash flows in in july  jrm completed the sale of its db combination derrick and pipelay barge and its oceanic barge  together with a shearleg crane installed on that vessel 
the cash sales price received for the db was approximately million 
jrm currently plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the db to fund forecasted capital expenditures through july  a permitted use under the indenture related to the jrm secured notes 
in accordance with this indenture  after july  a twelve month period jrm must make an offer to purchase an aggregate principal amount of the jrm secured notes with any remaining proceeds from the db sale 
to the extent that such an offer expires  any remaining cash proceeds from the offer to purchase will become unrestricted 
the cash sales price received for the oceanic was approximately million and  in accordance with the indenture relating to the jrm secured notes  jrm made an offer to purchase million aggregate principal amount of the jrm secured notes 
jrm did not receive any tenders of the jrm secured notes during the offer period and the million of previously restricted funds became unrestricted and available for jrm s general corporate purposes  subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture 
in addition  in december  jrm completed the sale of its inactive ardersier fabrication facility for approximately million 
the restrictions on these proceeds are the same as those described on the db above 
at december   jrm had million in outstanding letters of credit secured by collateral accounts funded with cash equal to of the amount outstanding 
in addition  jrm had million in letters of credit outstanding under a million letter of credit facility entered on august  this facility provided for an immediate credit advance of million  to secure letters of credit issued under the facility 
the obligation to repay the million advance under the facility is secured with liens placed on certain jrm assets  including its domestic accounts receivable and the db vessel 
the term of the facility is months with an optional redemption by jrm after months  with no financial covenants 
the non financial covenants and certain other terms and conditions of the million letter of credit facility are similar to those set forth in the indenture relating to the jrm secured notes 
this facility has a participation fee and letters of credit are charged at a fee 
as of december   mii had outstanding performance guarantees for four jrm projects 
mii has not previously been required to satisfy a material performance guaranty for jrm or any of its other subsidiaries 
all of these guarantees with a total cap of million relate to projects which have been completed and are in the warranty periods  the latest of which would expire in january jrm has incurred minimal warranty costs in prior years  and any substantial warranty costs in the future could possibly be covered in whole or in part by insurance 
however  if jrm incurs substantial warranty liabilities and is unable to respond  and such liabilities are not covered by insurance  mii would ultimately have to satisfy those claims 

table of contents in march  standard and poor s raised its corporate credit ratings on mii and mi to b from ccc 
at the same time  standard and poor s lowered its credit rating on jrm to ccc from b 
in march  moody s investor service also lowered its ratings of jrm to caa from b mi expects to meet its cash needs in through intercompany borrowings from bwxt  which bwxt may fund through operating cash flows or borrowings under its credit facility 
mi is restricted  as a result of covenants in its debt instruments  in its ability to transfer funds to mii and mii s other subsidiaries  including jrm  through cash dividends or through unsecured loans or investments 
at december   we had total restricted cash and cash equivalents of million  of which million was classified as non current 
the restricted cash and cash equivalents include the following million serves as collateral for letters of credit  serves as collateral for foreign exchange trading and other financial obligations  million is required to meet reserve requirements of our captive insurance companies  million of proceeds from asset sales by jrm is held in a separate account classified as noncurrent in order to ensure that jrm s use of those proceeds will comply with the applicable requirements of the indenture relating to the jrm secured notes  and million is held in restricted foreign accounts 
the million of proceeds from jrm s asset sale is classified as noncurrent since the funds are expected to be used to finance capital expenditures 
in addition  million of the cash serving as collateral for letters of credit is classified as noncurrent because the associated letters of credit have expiration dates beyond one year from december  at december  and  our balance in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets includes approximately million and million  respectively  in adjustments for bank overdrafts  with a corresponding increase in accounts payable for these overdrafts 
our working capital  excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents  improved by approximately million from a negative million at december  to a negative million at december  since december   million of restricted cash held by bwxt has been released 
in addition  as of august   in accordance with the indenture relating to the jrm secured notes  the temporary interest reserve of million is no longer required due to completion of the front runner project 
also in august  jrm s new million letter of credit facility allowed for the release of approximately million of cash previously restricted to collateralize letters of credit 
our net cash provided by operations was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used by operations of million for the year ended december  this improvement was attributable to an increase in net income and cash flow improvements at jrm 
our net cash provided by investing activities increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities increased in the year ended december  primarily as a result of the reclassification of restricted cash and cash equivalents to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and increased proceeds from asset sales 
at december   we had investments with a fair value of million

under the terms of an agreement between mii and b w  b w must reimburse mii for any costs mii may incur under any of these performance guarantees 
as of december   b w has sufficient liquidity to cover its obligations under this agreement 
however  if volund incurs and is unable to satisfy substantial warranty liabilities on these projects prior to expiration of the guaranty periods and b w is not able to satisfy its contractual obligation to mii and such liabilities are not covered by insurance  mii would be liable
