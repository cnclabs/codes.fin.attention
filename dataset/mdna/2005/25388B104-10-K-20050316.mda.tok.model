item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we are a provider of comprehensive e commerce outsourcing solutions 
we were incorporated in february and commenced offering products for sale through our clients e commerce stores in august from inception through august  we had no sales  and our activities related primarily to the development of our proprietary technology platform 
in  we began to focus our business development efforts on the software industry  building our catalog of software products through contracts with software publishers 
in  we began to develop software distribution relationships through contracts with online retailers 
in late  we began to offer our comprehensive e commerce outsourcing services in the form of a transaction fee based e commerce service to clients outside of the software industry 
as of march   we were providing e commerce services for more than  software and digital products publishers  manufacturers  online retailers and online channel partners 
prior to january   we managed our physical goods clients through a division formerly our e business services division that was separate from our software and digital commerce services division 
beginning in january  this divisional structure was consolidated  and we announced that we will no longer report our activities as separate business segments 
nonetheless  we remain committed to serving existing and new clients in the important vertical market of physical goods 
we have approximately eight years of operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
until  we incurred significant losses  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we intend to expend financial and management resources on the development of additional services  sales and marketing  technology and operations to support larger scale operations and greater service offerings 
although we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in  there can be no assurance that our revenue will increase or even continue at its current level or that we will maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as e commerce 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  attract and retain software publishers and online retailers as clients  attract and retain physical goods clients  introduce new web sites  online stores or services  continue to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to meet emerging market needs and remain competitive in our service offerings  and retain and attract personnel commensurate with our business needs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these risks  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current and future expense levels are based largely on our planned operations and estimates of future revenue 
revenue and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which are difficult to forecast 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenue could have an immediate adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuations in demand for the products or services offered by us or our clients  such as anti virus software and tax preparation software  among others 
in particular  sales of anti virus software represented a significant portion of our revenues in recent years  and continue to be very important to our business 
to the extent that our competitors successfully introduce products or services not sold through our platform that are competitive with products and services sold by current digital river clients including anti virus products and services  our revenues will be adversely affected 
we are also likely to continue to see revenue fluctuate on a seasonal basis  which is typical for the software publishing market in general and for our existing physical goods clients 
we believe that our first and fourth quarters tend to be seasonally stronger than our second and third quarters due to the timing of demand for tax preparation software and the holiday season selling period 
in addition  we believe that software publishers avoid new product releases in the summer months 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we are unable to accurately forecast our revenue and believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce services provided to our clients and end customers 
these services include e commerce development and hosting  transaction processing  fraud screening  digital delivery  integration to physical fulfillment  merchandising services  analytical marketing  customer service and proprietary software backup services 
we report our revenue on a net basis and therefore record only the net service fees and transaction fees as our revenue 
we act as the merchant of record on most of the transactions processed and have contractual relationships with our clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we retain our transaction fee and also charge fees for services rendered 
signed contracts are obtained from clients prior to recognition of these revenues 
clients do not have the right to take possession of the software applications used in the delivery of services 
payments received in advance of rendering the service  even if non refundable  are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical experience and current trends 
management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our billed accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our operating results for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
credit card chargeback reserve 
estimates are also used in determining our accrued chargeback expenses and are based on our historical experience and current trends 
management makes an estimate of anticipated future credit card chargebacks related to current period revenue by analyzing the timing of historical credit card chargebacks as well as reviewing the current charge back trends and applying a conservative anticipated rate to current period revenues 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued expenses in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our operating results for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we amortize property  plant and equipment  certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers nonfinancial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
if indicators of impairment are present  we utilize an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine the impairment amount  if any 
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present for impairment utilizing the two step approach prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our assessment has indicated that there have been no impairments of goodwill for the years  and income taxes and deferred taxes 
we currently have significant us tax loss carryforwards resulting primarily from the tax deduction for disqualifying disposition of stock options  and a lesser amount of acquired foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax benefit of the loss carryforwards has been fully reserved by a valuation allowance pursuant to gaap 
the benefit of the loss carryforwards from disqualifying disposition of stock options will be recognized as additional paid in capital when these deductions are utilized in future periods 
the valuation reserve of the deferred tax asset will be removed if and when we have met the requirements under gaap of more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
deferred tax assets are the tax value of temporary timing differences for financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities

when these disqualifying disposition deductions are realized for financial statement purposes they will not result in a reduction in income tax expense  rather the benefit will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
these income tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years through additionally  we have made a section election allowing us to deduct the step up basis in acquisitions of approximately million over years 
deductions from disqualifying dispositions of stock options are included in net operating loss carryforwards with a corresponding valuation allowance 
because of the uncertainty of future realization  a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded

payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total amount committed and thereafter operating lease obligations convertible senior notes total we expect to continue to evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions  including business combinations and acquisitions of businesses  products  services and other assets as well as licenses of technology related to our current business 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more such transactions 
any such transactions could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges for our operational  financial and management information systems  as well as unforeseen expenditures and other risks  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key customers  employees and business partners  difficulties in managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas  and difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
in addition  an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on any acquisition or that future acquisitions will not be dilutive to our current shareholders percentage ownership or to earnings 
we have allocated significant value in the form of goodwill and intangibles for the companies we acquired in the past  which is subject to impairment testing on a regular basis 
if the individual businesses do not perform as expected at the acquisition dates  we may incur impairment charges for goodwill  accelerated amortization of definite lived intangibles due to shortened expected lives of these assets  immediate write offs and restructuring or other related expenses 
in april  in connection with our acquisition of element  we established a million secured revolving credit facility with harris trust and savings bank 
this facility was repaid in full and terminated in connection with the sale and issuance of our convertible senior notes in june with respect to our convertible senior notes  we are required to pay interest on the notes on january and july of each year beginning january  the notes bear interest at a rate of and  if specified conditions are met  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes may be surrendered for conversion under certain circumstances  including the satisfaction of a market price condition  such that the price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold  the satisfaction of a trading price condition  such that the trading price of the notes falls below a specified level  the redemption of the notes by us  the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as defined in the related indenture  and the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the related indenture 
the initial conversion price is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  of principal amount of the notes 
we will adjust the conversion price if certain events occur  as specified in the related indenture  such as the issuance of our common stock as a dividend or distribution or the occurrence of a stock subdivision or combination 
if a fundamental change  such as a change in our control  as defined in the related indenture  occurs on or before january   we may also be required to purchase the notes for cash and pay an additional make whole premium payable in our common stock upon the repurchase or conversion of the notes in connection with the fundamental change 
holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes prior to maturity on january   and we have the right to redeem the notes  under certain circumstances  on or after july  and prior to january   and we may redeem the notes at anytime on or after january  liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe that existing sources of liquidity and the results of our operations will provide adequate cash to fund our on going operations for the foreseeable future  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that period 
in january  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we could issue up to million in common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and or warrants 
of this amount  approximately million was utilized to issue common stock in our july public offering leaving approximately million available for future use 
in january  we filed a registration statement to increase our available shelf registration amount from approximately million to million 
in addition  we filed an acquisition shelf for up to approximately million shares 
these filings were made to provide future flexibility for acquisition and financing purposes 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render service 
we will adopt sfas r effective on july   requiring compensation cost to be recognized as expense for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  and any new awards made thereafter  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
interest rate risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government obligations and money market funds 
investments are classified as available for sale securities and carried at their market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
as of december   all securities held had maturities of less than three years 
a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the market value of certain securities in our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or utilize derivative financial instruments 
a hypothetical and immediate percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  by million 
a hypothetical and immediate percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  by million 
such hypothetical changes in interest rates would not materially impact our investment portfolio held at december  the approximate gains or losses in earnings are estimates  and actual results could vary due to the assumptions used 
we currently have million of fixed rate continent convertible debt outstanding 
we believe there is minimal risk that market interest rates will drop significantly below 
foreign currency risk our operations have historically been conducted primarily in the united states currency and as such have not been subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  the growth in our international operations is increasing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
for example  approximately half of our recently acquired subsidiary element s revenue is denominated in euros or currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  a greater proportion of our revenues and earnings are now subject to currency fluctuations 
we translate statement of operations amounts that are denominated in foreign currency into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
conversely  our net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
we do not currently have a currency hedging program to mitigate the effect of fluctuations of currency prices on our financial results 
were the foreign currency exchange rates to depreciate immediately and uniformly against the us dollar by percent from levels at december  and  our reported cash balances would decrease million and million  or and percent  respectively  and net investment in foreign operations would decrease by million 
the approximate gain or losses in earnings or foreign investment are estimates  and actual results could vary due to the assumptions used
