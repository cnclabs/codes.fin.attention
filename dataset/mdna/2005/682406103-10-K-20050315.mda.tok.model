item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered and self managed reit and we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
as of december   we owned properties  participated in six joint ventures that owned a total of properties and held a tenancy in common interest in one property 
in january we acquired five additional properties 
these properties are located in states 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to comply with these requirements and to maintain our reit status 
our principal business strategy is to acquire improved  commercial properties subject to long term net leases 
we acquire properties for their value as long term investments and for their ability to generate income over an extended period of time 
we have borrowed funds in the past to finance the purchase of real estate and we expect to do so in the future 
our rental properties are generally leased to corporate tenants under operating leases substantially all of which are noncancellable 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements that require the tenant to pay not only rent  but also substantially all of the operating expenses of the leased property  including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and certain of our other leases provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
during the year ended december   we purchased five single tenant properties and one property with two tenants  in six states  for a total consideration of million 
we assumed pre existing first mortgages aggregating million on two of these properties 
an aggregate of million of first mortgage financing was completed with respect to two of the other properties 
in january  we purchased five additional single tenant properties for a total consideration of approximately million 
we are a venturer in two joint ventures organized for the purpose of acquiring and owning megaplex stadium style movie theaters 
we own a equity interest and are the managing member in each of these ventures with the same co venturer 
these joint ventures own one partial stadium style theater  one stadium style theater under construction construction has been suspended pending leasing the site to an operator  and eight megaplex stadium style movie theaters for a total consideration of approximately million 
our equity investment in these movie theater ventures at december  was million  net of distributions from the joint ventures 
we are also a joint venturer in four additional joint ventures  each of which was organized to acquire one single tenanted property 
our equity investment in these four joint ventures at december  was million  net of distributions 
at december   excluding mortgages payable of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we had outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating million in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value  as adjusted for intangibles  of approximately million before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and mature between and results of operations outlook in may and in october and november we completed two public offerings of our common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million and million  respectively 
a major portion of the net proceeds from the may offering was applied to acquire five properties  both directly by us and through joint ventures 
through december   we had used substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering as follows million to redeem all of our outstanding preferred stock  million to pay down our credit line and the balance to acquire five properties both directly by us and through joint ventures 
in  we anticipate that we will use our available cash funds derived from mortgages placed on our unencumbered properties and our credit line to acquire additional properties  either directly or through joint ventures 
as a result  we will own more properties in and unless we experience an unusual number of lease terminations and or cancellations in taking into consideration the lease expirations and terminations that we know will occur in  and without giving effect to any re letting of such properties  we anticipate that our revenues and possibly our net income will increase in comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues our revenues consist primarily of rental income from tenants in our rental properties 
rental income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental income is primarily due to million of rental revenues earned during the year ended december  on eleven properties acquired by us during and the increase in rental income also includes  received from the sale of our bankruptcy claim in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings involving a retail tenant which disaffirmed its lease and vacated the property 
there were also increases in rental income at several of our other properties 
interest and other income increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was  received in from the settlement of a claim made by us regarding the purchase of one of our properties 
the increase in interest and other income also includes  of net acquisition fees received by us from a joint venture we recently organized 
the net acquisition fee  calculated pursuant to the joint venture agreement at of the purchase price of the acquired property  reflects a reduction based on our share of ownership in the joint venture 
to a lesser extent  the increase is due to interest earned on our investment of the balance of the net proceeds received from our october offering 
these increases were offset in part by the receipt in the year ended of  of interest earned on short term mortgages receivable acquired or originated by us to facilitate acquisitions 
our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from our purchase of an additional interest in one of our movie theater joint ventures as of october   resulting in an increase in our equity in earnings of this joint venture of  for the year ended december  another joint venture in which we have a interest received  from the sale of its bankruptcy claim in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding involving its retail tenant which disaffirmed its lease and vacated the property 
our equity in earnings from this joint venture increased  for the year ended december  we also participate in two joint ventures  one organized in august and one organized in november these joint ventures each purchased one property  and in we recognized income of  and  respectively  from these joint ventures 
these increases were offset in part as a result of a million direct write off of unbilled rent receivable balances by one of our joint ventures in which we have a interest that were previously recorded relating to two movie theaters under common control 
we executed a lease termination agreement regarding one of these theaters which was under construction and since september  rent was paid in compliance with a stipulation relating to the other theater 
during february  the operator of this movie theater sold its business to an independent third party and the arrearages of rent and other miscellaneous charges of approximately  that were due in august were accelerated 
in exchange for the joint venture s agreement to consent to the lease assignment and lease amendment and to waive the requirement for a security deposit under the amended lease  the joint venture received  restricted shares of class a common stock of the tenant s parent company  which trades on the american stock exchange

during december  million of the borrowings were repaid with the proceeds from a mortgage financing of one of our properties

in addition  the million outstanding under our credit facility will be repaid from mortgage financings or refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
in addition  we  as ground lessee  are obligated under a ground lease for a property owned in fee by an unrelated third party 
the annual fixed leasehold rent expense is as follows more than total years we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant is engaged and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we would be required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which would have an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken and would decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
at december   one of the movie theater joint ventures  in which we are a venturer  took a  direct write off against unbilled rent receivable balances relating to two movie theaters initially leased to operators under common control 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets in order to determine if there is any need for a provision for valuation adjustment 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  its location  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
we also ascertain appropriate capitalization rates for the real estate asset in the area in which the property is located and apply such capitalization rate to the net operating income derived from that asset 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  recognition of impairment is required if the calculated value is less than the asset s carrying amount 
we do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any provision taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation adjustment  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
we took a provision for valuation adjustment in of  with respect to one property where the retail tenant had filed for bankruptcy protection  disaffirmed its lease and vacated the store 
the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
during the year ended december  the effect on the financial statements was not material 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk all of our long term mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit line is a variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
however  for the year ended december   due to a low average balance outstanding on the credit line  we do not believe that the effect of changes in interest rates would materially impact the amount of interest expense incurred 
the fair market value fmv of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our long term debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fmv at december  amounts in thousands for the year ended december  there after total fmv long term debt fixed rate         weighted average interest rate variable rate
