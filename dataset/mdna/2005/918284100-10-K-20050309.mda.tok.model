item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview vse organization vse s business operations consist primarily of services performed by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries and unincorporated divisions 
the company uses multiple operating entities to bid on and perform contract work 
the use of an operating structure with multiple entities gives the company certain competitive advantages and the flexibility to pursue a diverse business base 
the term vse or company refers to vse and its subsidiaries and divisions unless the context indicates operations of the parent company only 
energetics incorporated energetics is currently vse s only active subsidiary 
vse s human resource systems  inc hrsi subsidiary was active in and the sole hrsi contract expired on may   and this work was continued on a new contract in a vse division 
hrsi was dissolved in active divisions through the end of include bav division bav  coast guard division vcg  communications and engineering division ced beginning in february  fleet maintenance division fmd  management sciences division msd  systems engineering division sed  and value systems services division vss 
beginning in  the company transferred the operations of vss to another division and will rename and position vss for other business pursuits 
vse also has several other subsidiaries and divisions that were inactive in  but had contract activity in prior years 
ttd discontinued operations in february  vse decided to terminate operations of its telecommunications technologies division ttd due to declining revenues and significant losses sustained by this division 
ttd continued work on uncompleted contracts during and to satisfy its contractual obligations and upon finishing work in july ttd was classified as a discontinued operation 
some of ttd s technical capabilities were transferred to other vse divisions 
the loss of revenue associated with the termination of ttd operations is not significant compared to total vse revenue  while the elimination of ttd losses will improve vse profits 
vse customers and services the company is engaged principally in providing engineering  design  logistics  management and technical services to the us government the government  other government prime contractors  and commercial entities 
the largest customer for the services rendered by the company is the us department of defense defense  including agencies of the us army  navy  and air force 
other customers include the department of homeland security  the us postal service  the department of energy  and the department of treasury 
the majority of vse s work is performed for the us navy 
bav is a major provider of logistics  training  and technical assistance in support of the navy s ship transfer program see bav contract below 
fmd supports the navy by providing a variety of services including ship installation efforts  combat systems inspections  ship repair and overhaul availability planning  harpoon weapons management  ordnance alteration  and air combat logistics 
vss has provided the navy with outsourcing decision assistance 
vcg provides services to the us coast guard that are similar to the work performed by bav for the navy 
vse also performs a significant amount of its work for the us army 
sed provides the army with equipment refurbishment services  military vehicle protection systems  engineering and technical support for ground weapons  logistics and training services  material procurement support  and prototype development support for combat vehicles 
msd provides the army  as well as other government agencies and commercial organizations  with quality training services for product  process  and management optimization 
ced provides management oversight and coordinates support efforts for a variety of government work orders on a large army contract 
the company has also provided support services to the us postal service for over twenty years and is continuing to support this customer through its sed division 
energetics is focused on providing the department of energy and other government and industry customers with expert consulting services in environmental management and energy supply  resource management  and conservation 
the company also provides support services to the us department of treasury and has offered products  services  and support in network  multimedia  and audio visual technology including design  installation  management and support for voice  data  multimedia and related projects to various government agencies and commercial organizations 
bav contract vse s bav division has a contract with the us navy to provide engineering  technical and logistical support services associated with the sale  lease  or transfer of navy ships to foreign governments 
this cost plus contract was awarded as a ten year contract in and has a total ceiling value of over billion 
the level of revenues and associated profits resulting from fee income generated by this contract varies depending on a number of factors  including the timing of ship transfers and associated support services ordered by foreign governments and economic conditions of potential customers worldwide 
the company has experienced significant quarterly and annual revenue fluctuations and anticipates that future quarterly and annual revenues will be subject to variation primarily due to changes in the level of activity associated with the navy s ship transfer program 
during its life  this contract has been the company s single largest revenue producer 
revenues generated by this contract have typically accounted for approximately to of vse s consolidated revenues  and during and the contract accounted for approximately and of consolidated revenues  respectively 
one of the major efforts currently conducted under this contract is the transfer of four us navy ships to taiwan 
the original bav contract is scheduled to end in the navy has issued a solicitation for proposals on a new contract for the overall ship transfer program through a competitive solicitation process 
for further discussion  refer to longer term concerns under management outlook 
contract terms specify award fee payments to bav that are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the contract modification authorizing the award fee is certain 
award fees are made three times during the year 
accordingly  the company typically has three quarterly reporting periods during a year that include the recognition of bav award fee income and one quarterly reporting period that does not include bav award fee income 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
government procurement policies and practices vse s business is subject to the risks arising from economic conditions and political factors that may impact the budgets and program funding of customers served through vse s contracts 
vse s revenues have historically been subject to annual fluctuations resulting from changes in the level of defense spending 
future budgetary and funding decisions by government lawmakers or defense restructuring efforts could affect the types and level of services provided by vse to its government customers and could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s revenues depend on the ability of the company to win new contracts and on the amount of work ordered by the government under the company s existing contracts 
the company s ability to win new contracts is affected by government acquisition policies and procedures  including government procurement practices that in some years have tended toward bundling work efforts under large comprehensive omnibus management contracts 
this emphasis on large contracts presents challenges to winning new contract work  including making it more difficult for the company to qualify as a bidder  increases in the level of competition due to the award of fewer contracts  and forcing the company into competition with larger organizations that have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs 
competing for these contracts requires the company to use teams of subcontractors to be able to offer the range of technical competencies needed to do the work 
while the use of subcontractors on a large scale basis allows the company to compete for this work  profit margins on subcontract work are lower than on work performed by company personnel  thereby reducing the company s overall profit margins 
the use of subcontractors on government contracts also raises certain performance and financial risks to vse in that government prime contractors are usually obligated to ensure compliance with us government regulations relative to the performance by subcontractors 
company revenues over a period of time can also depend on the length of its contracts 
the length of time for which a government contract is issued can vary depending on changes in contracting regulations and other factors 
during  the defense department issued rules and rule clarifications limiting the length of contracts to five years and then later extended this limit to ten years 
the company is unable to predict what impact these changes will have on future contract awards and revenues 
other government procurement practices that can affect the company s revenues are the use of past performance criteria that may preclude entrance into new government markets and government social programs that limit contract work to small  woman  or minority owned businesses 
additional risk factors that could potentially affect the company s results of operations are the government s right to terminate contracts for convenience  the government s right to not exercise all of the option periods on a contract  and funding delays caused by government political or administrative actions 
global economic conditions and political factors vse s business is subject to the risks arising from global economic conditions and political factors associated with current and potential customers served through vse s contracts with the us government 
an economic slowdown in countries served under the bav contract could potentially affect sales 
the current international situation posed by potential terrorist activity and the continuing conflict in the middle east could potentially increase the political risks associated with bav contract revenues 
failure by the government of a potential foreign customer to approve and fund acquisition of us navy ships serviced under the bav contract could affect sales 
in any one year  a significant amount of the company s revenues may result from sales on the bav contract to a single foreign government 
bav contract sales to egypt have historically represented a large percentage of the company s total sales in any one year 
work associated with the transfer of four ships to taiwan under the bav contract during also represented a large percentage of total sales  and is expected to also represent a large percentage of sales 
if bav is successful in winning the new follow on contract for this work  future years revenues are expected to include large amounts of bav contract sales to both egypt and taiwan 
in addition to the effect on bav revenues  international tensions can also affect work by fmd on us navy ships when they are deployed away from us navy facilities and are unavailable for maintenance work during this time period 
adverse results arising from these global economic and political risks could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations

   total revenues    management outlook a record year vse experienced a record setting year for revenues and profits in the taiwan ship transfer work on the bav contract is the primary reason for higher revenues in this transfer has resulted in an increase in the revenues of bav of approximately during as compared to the ced rapid response contract see significant contract awards below and fmd s continuing work on navy programs contributed significantly to increased revenues for revenues in several of vse s other divisions also showed strong growth in see results of operations below for a more detailed discussion of results 
prospects for continued growth there are several indications that vse will continue to increase its revenues and profits in these indicators include taiwan ship transfer the taiwan ship transfer effort is expected to continue to provide bav with elevated revenue levels in and into funded backlog on the bav contract was approximately million as of december   as compared to approximately million as of december  tbps program in november  vse s sed division was awarded a fixed price letter contract by the us army to begin work on a program to provide a protection system for army vehicles  the tanker ballistic protection system tbps 
under this program  sed will apply a fuel tank self sealing system and necessary add on armor panels for army fuel dispensing tankers as protection from damage resulting from hostile fire 
the army subsequently modified the original letter contract to increase the number of tankers to be modified and has funded this program for approximately million as of december  testing and preparatory work on this program was conducted in november and december and the tbps was applied to the first tanker in january accordingly  sed began recognizing revenue on this contract based on units delivered in january sed expects to receive a definitive contract and additional funding in early to formalize contract coverage 
there is also the possibility that the army may increase the scope of work by adding more tankers to be included in the program  which would further increase the work performed by sed 
this program presents new risks and challenges to vse s business while also increasing the potential for greater revenue growth and profitability in significant contract awards in and  vse received three contract awards with large ceiling amounts 
these are multiyear  multiple award  indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts  with no funding committed at the time of award 
vse is one of several awardees on each contract 
in general  vse s realized revenues from these contracts are significantly below their respective ceiling amounts and future vse revenue from these contracts cannot be predicted with certainty 
these contract awards  however  provide vse with opportunities to compete for work that may contribute significantly to future revenue growth 
in january  vse formed its communications and engineering division ced upon the award of a multiyear rapid response support contract by the us army communications electronics command cecom 
the contract enhances the company s revenue producing capabilities by allowing it to provide services through any of vse s operating entities or through third party subcontractors for various end user government customers 
if all options are exercised  this contract has a potential total ceiling of approximately billion over an eight year period 
while it is not likely that the full ceiling amount will be realized  this contract has generated revenues for vse of approximately million and million during and  respectively 
in april  fmd was awarded a contract by the us navy  seaport enhanced  which includes a five year base period and two five year option periods 
this contract is a procurement vehicle for the navy to use for ordering services from a wide range of contractors to support all phases of naval ship and shipboard weapons systems acquisition and life cycle support 
while this award does not guarantee any revenues for vse  the company is one of several contractors eligible to bid for services during the life of the contract 
this contract has not generated any revenue for the company as of december  in september  fmd was awarded a contract by the us navy to provide engineering and technical services to support naval sea systems command maintenance  overhaul  repair  and alteration of systems aboard ships 
this contract has a total contract ceiling amount of billion over a five year period if all option periods are exercised 
this contract has not generated any revenue for the company as of december  increases in bookings and funded backlog revenue increases in government contracting businesses such as that experienced by vse in are typically preceded by increases in contract funding bookings and a build up of funded contract backlog 
vse s bookings and funded backlog began to increase in late and continued increasing through the end of  giving the company a firm basis for a continuation in revenue growth in in millions bookings 















funded backlog 












revenues 















previous concerns mitigated two areas of concern to management at the beginning of have shown improvement and are of less concern going into ced incurred losses in on the rapid response support contract during its first year of operation and during the first nine months of  due primarily to low revenue levels and to costs associated with the start up of the division 
ced s losses have decreased as the division has moved beyond the start up phase and revenue levels have increased for both this division and on a company wide basis 
ced revenues are expected to continue to have a positive impact on overall company profitability in  however  the potential exists for future losses in ced if revenue expectations are not met 
vse has accrued liabilities of approximately thousand against any future losses associated with ced operations as of december  the second concern involved the utilization of the company s primary office facility 
vse does not always occupy all of the space in its primary leased office facility and has from time to time subleased parts of this facility to other tenants 
during  some of the company s larger subtenants did not renew their subleases with vse  which resulted in some losses to the company in and during the time that the space was vacant 
vse was successful in efforts to sublease a majority of the vacant office space to new tenants in and believes that more vacant space will be subleased in the near future  but a portion of the facility remains underutilized as of december  the remaining vacant space presents a risk that could have a negative impact on future earnings  however  the company believes it has adequate accrued liabilities of approximately thousand for estimated future losses associated with this underutilization 
longer term concerns the original bav contract ending date was in in  the navy modified the contract expiration date from to to ensure continuity of work with respect to the taiwan ship transfer 
the navy has issued a solicitation for proposals on a new contract for the overall ship transfer program through a competitive solicitation process 
while bav has submitted a proposal and believes it has an excellent chance to win the new contract award  there is a risk that the award could be made to another contractor 
the award will be made after a period of evaluation by the navy 
the uncertainty associated with the award of the new bav contract significantly affects the longer term outlook for vse 
if bav fails to win the new contract  vse will suffer a substantial reduction in its annual revenue and profits attributable to this program 
the company s revenues and profits increased significantly in and are expected to increase further in there is a possibility that some of the programs contributing significantly to vse revenues and profits in these years will expire after the expiration of these programs will present challenges for the company to sustain the same level of revenue and profit growth beyond to mitigate these risks  vse is submitting proposals to win new work and is exploring potential acquisition opportunities 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company can adopt sfas r in one of two ways the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
the company will adopt sfas r on july  and is currently evaluating the alternative methods 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for the years ending december   and for such excess tax deductions were approximately thousand  thousand  and thousand for  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies vse s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require vse to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting polices affect our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of the company s services are performed for its customers on a contract basis 
the three primary types of contracts used are cost type contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenues result from work performed on these contracts by the company s employees and from pass through of costs for material and work performed by subcontractors 
revenues on cost type contracts are recorded as contract allowable costs are incurred and fees earned 
profits on cost type contracts are equal to the fees that are earned 
the bav contract terms specify award fee payments that are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
award fees are made three times during the year and a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the contract modification authorizing the award fee is certain 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues on this contract will fluctuate from period to period 
revenues for time and materials contracts are recorded on the basis of contract allowable labor hours worked times the contract defined billing rates  plus the cost of materials used in performance on the contract 
profits on time and material contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract defined billing rates for these services 
revenue recognition methods on fixed price contracts will vary depending on the nature of the work and the contract terms 
on certain fixed price contracts revenues are recorded as costs are incurred  using the percentage of completion method of accounting  since these contracts require design  engineering  or manufacturing services performed to the customer s specifications 
revenues on fixed price service contracts are recorded as services are provided 
revenues on fixed price contracts that require delivery of specific items may be recorded based on a price per unit as units are delivered 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
the company will occasionally perform work at risk  which is work that is performed prior to the government formalizing funding for such work 
revenue related to work performed at risk is not recognized until it can be reliably estimated and its realization is probable 
vse recognizes this risk funding as revenue when the associated costs are incurred or the work is performed 
vse is at risk of loss for any risk funding not received 
the company provides for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to income during the period in which losses are first identified 
revenues recognized in include approximately thousand for which the company had not received formalized funding as of december  the company received funding modifications for approximately thousand of this amount in february  leaving approximately thousand of revenues classified as risk funding 
vse believes that it will receive funding for this remaining risk funding revenue 
revenues by contract type for the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands contract type revenues revenues revenues cost type 




   time and materials 
   fixed price 



   long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  vse must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  vse may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to a review for impairment at least annually 
the company performs its annual impairment test on september as of december   the company had approximately million of goodwill associated with its acquisition of energetics in the company has not recognized any reduction to the goodwill due to the impairment rules 
if at some time in the future it is determined that impairment has occurred  such impairment could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
contingencies from time to time vse is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor and other matters 
vse is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 
income taxes the carrying value of vse net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding vse s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions regarding vse s future taxable income change in the future  vse may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense

revenues increased by approximately and for the years ended december  and december   as compared to each of the respective prior years 
the primary reasons for the increase in revenues in were an increase in work performed under the bav contract  including increased revenues associated with the taiwan ship transfer  the ced rapid response contract received work orders that generated revenues throughout the full year in  as compared to the prior year when the contract was awarded in february of and did not begin to receive any significant amount of work until september  and increased levels of work performed by fmd due in part to the navy s elevated readiness requirements 
work requirements and revenues also increased in sed  msd and vcg 
during  the company had decreased revenues in some of its divisions and subsidiaries which were offset by increases in the revenues of others 
the most notable area of decline in revenue was in bav  which was due to work ordered by certain client countries in that was not repeated in revenues also declined slightly for energetics  hrsi and vss 
the declines in revenues of these divisions were offset by the revenues generated by the start up of ced and an increase in the revenues of the company s other active divisions compared to the prior year 
while the increased revenues in sed  msd  and vcg were not significant in proportion to total company revenues  the increases were significant in proportion to the prior years revenues of each of these divisions

   vse s gross profit margin on continuing operations remained substantially unchanged during as compared to and increased in as compared to due to a large amount of material and travel activity  the bav contract tends to have lower gross margins than other vse contracts 
accordingly  increases in bav contract work as a percentage of total company revenues tend to decrease companywide gross margins  and decreases in bav contract work as a percentage of total company revenues tend to increase companywide gross margins 
additionally  companywide revenue increases tend to increase the gross margins realized on the company s fixed price and t m contracts due to the ability to spread corporate costs over a larger revenue base 
changes in the amount of revenues for each of vse s operating divisions as a percentage of total company revenues and the increases in total company revenues are the primary reasons for changes in the gross profit margins during   and another factor that has affected gross margins is the operational losses associated with ced in and  and to a lesser extent by start up costs associated with ced in other factors that affect the company s gross margins include the timing of contract award fees  effective project and cost management  and competitive factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses that are not chargeable or reimbursable on the company s operating unit contracts 
these costs increased in as compared to due to the cost associated with vacant facilities in other expenses of this type remained substantially unchanged in as a percentage of revenues  these expenses did not vary much in and as compared to the respective prior years 
vse did not have significant borrowing requirements or interest expense in   and the company s interest income increased in as compared to and the company had interest income in as compared to interest expense in as profits from operations and resulting cash surpluses were invested 
discontinued operations in july  all business operations associated with the company s ttd division ceased 
accordingly  prior period consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the financial results of ttd as discontinued operations 
the revenues  costs and expenses of ttd have been excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated statement of operations 
the loss from discontinued operations associated with ttd  net of tax  in the years ended december    and was approximately thousand  thousand and  thousand  respectively 
financial condition the company s largest asset is its accounts receivable and its largest liabilities are its accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable increased approximately million  and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately million in as compared to due primarily to the increase in the level of business activity and the associated billings to customers and subcontractor payments required to perform this work 
the increase in total stockholder s investment in resulted primarily from earnings and dividend activity and from the exercise of stock options 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was used in operating activities  investing activities used approximately million  and financing activities provided approximately million 
the difference between cash used in operating activities of approximately million in as compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately million in is primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and contract inventories associated with contract requirements for significant material and subcontractor usage for which the billing and collections cycle had not been completed 
the accounts receivable and contract inventories increases were partially offset by increases in net income and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of million provided by bank loan proceeds  thousand provided by the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options  and thousand used to pay dividends 
the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was provided by operating activities  investing activities used approximately thousand  and financing activities used approximately thousand 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of thousand used to pay dividends and thousand provided by the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased in as compared to due primarily to increases in net income and accounts payable  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was provided by operating activities  investing activities used approximately thousand  and financing activities used approximately thousand 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of the repayment of thousand of bank loan borrowings  thousand used to pay dividends  and thousand provided by the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options 
cash dividends were declared at the rate of 
per share for the quarter ending march  and 
per share for the quarters ending june   september  and december  pursuant to its bank loan agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the payment of cash dividends by vse is subject to annual rate restrictions 
vse has paid cash dividends each year since liquidity the company s internal sources of liquidity result primarily from operating activities  specifically from changes in the level of revenues and associated accounts receivable and accounts payable from period to period  and from profitability 
significant increases or decreases in revenue and accounts receivable and accounts payable can cause significant increases or decreases in internal liquidity 
accounts receivable arise primarily from billings made by the company to the government or other government prime contractors for services rendered and payments received on accounts receivable represent the principal source of cash for the company 
accounts receivable levels can be affected by contract retainages  differences between the provisional billing rates authorized by the government compared to the costs actually incurred by the company  government delays in processing administrative paperwork for contract funding  and the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on company s contracts 
the company acquired contract inventories of approximately million as of december   due to work performed by sed on the tbps contract 
contract inventories consisted of materials  supplies and other expenditures for which the end unit has not yet been completed and accepted 
although these costs are classified as contract inventories for accounting purposes  they are similar in nature to materials and direct supplies purchased for use in performance on the company s other contracts in that they are solely and directly attributable to the contract and will be billed to the customer within a relatively short time 
all of the million of contract inventories is expected to be liquidated  billed  and collected in these materials and direct supplies will not be restocked to maintain any permanent contract inventory levels 
accounts payable arise primarily from purchases of subcontractor services and materials used by the company in the performance of its contract work 
payments made on accounts payable  along with payments made to satisfy employee payroll and payroll associated expenses  make up the principal cash requirements of the company 
accounts payable levels can be affected by changes in the level of contract work performed by the company and by the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on the company s contracts 
other cash requirements include the acquisition of capital assets for office and computer support  facilities maintenance  and the payment of cash dividends 
the company invested approximately million related to expansion and improvement of facilities at two locations during and has commitments to complete this work for an additional amount of approximately thousand in these investments were for the expansion of its facility in ladysmith  virginia in support of growth in sed and improvements at its primary office facility in alexandria  virginia 
vse s external sources of liquidity consist of a revolving bank loan agreement that provides loan financing based on the company s accounts receivable see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bank financing complements the internal sources of liquidity by providing increasing levels of borrowing capacity as accounts receivable levels increase 
the bank loan agreement provided loan financing up to a maximum commitment of million as of december  the company has determined that the million commitment is adequate to cover current and future liquidity requirements 
the expiration date of the revolving loan is may  performance of work under the bav contract and other contracts that require significant amounts of subcontractor or material purchases have the potential to cause substantial requirements for working capital  however  management believes that cash flows from operations and the bank loan commitment are adequate to meet current operating cash requirements

   purchase obligations 

total    bank notes payable consists of a revolving loan agreement that contains collateral requirements by which company assets secure amounts outstanding  restrictive covenants that include minimum tangible net worth and profitability requirements  a limit on annual dividends  and other affirmative and negative covenants 
this loan balance was paid in full when accounts receivable were collected in january  operating lease commitments are primarily for vse s principal executive and administrative offices and leased facilities for office  shop  and warehouse space located near customer sites 
the company also has some equipment and software leases that are included in these amounts 
purchase obligations consist primarily of contractual commitments associated with construction  improvements and maintenance on vse facilities  and for the acquisition of office  shop  and computer equipment 
generally  contracts with commercial customers for purchases of materials or services that are not associated with performance on the company s prime contracts with the us government are included in the above table 
the table excludes contractual commitments for materials or subcontractor work purchased to perform on our us government contracts 
such commitments for materials and subcontractors are reimbursable to the company when used on the contracts  and generally are also reimbursable to the company by the us government in the event a contract is terminated for convenience pursuant to federal contracting regulations 
inflation and pricing most of the contracts performed by vse provide for estimates of future labor costs to be escalated for any option periods provided by the contracts  while the non labor costs included in such contracts are normally considered reimbursable at cost 
vse property and equipment consists principally of computer systems equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the overall impact of inflation on replacement costs of such property and equipment is not expected to be significant 
disclosures about market risk interest rates vse s bank loan financing provides available borrowing to the company at variable interest rates 
the company has not borrowed significant amounts on the loan in recent years 
accordingly  the company does not believe that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows 
if vse were to significantly increase borrowings on the current loan arrangement  future interest rate changes could potentially have a material impact 
foreign currency while a significant amount of the company s business results from the services provided by bav related to the transfer of ships to foreign governments  the bav contract payments are made by the us government in us dollars 
additionally  most funding requirements to support work performed or services purchased in foreign countries are made in us dollars  and the infrequent disbursements that are made in foreign currencies are reimbursable to bav in post conversion dollars 
foreign currency transactions of other vse divisions or subsidiaries are virtually non existent 
accordingly  the company does not believe that it is exposed to any material foreign currency risk
