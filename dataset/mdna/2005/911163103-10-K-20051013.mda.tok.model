item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a leading national distributor of natural and organic foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share through our high quality service and a broader product selection  the acquisition of  or merger with  natural products distributors  the expansion of our existing distribution centers and the construction of new distribution centers 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
our estimated market share increased from to from calendar to calendar  based on industry data compiled by one of the industry s leading trade publications  the natural foods merchandiser 
we also own and operate retail natural products stores  located primarily in florida  through our subsidiary  nrg 
we believe that our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business because it enables us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
in addition  our subsidiary  hershey imports  specializes in the international importing  roasting and packaging of nuts  seeds  dried fruits and snack items 
our operations are comprised of three principal divisions our wholesale division  which includes our broadline distribution  albert s and select nutrition  our retail division  which consists of our retail stores  and our manufacturing division  which is comprised of hershey imports 
in order to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we are continually expanding our marketing and customer service programs across regions  expanding our national purchasing opportunities  offering a broader product selection  consolidating systems applications among physical locations and regions  increasing our investment in people  facilities  equipment and technology  integrating administrative and accounting functions  and reducing geographic overlap between regions 
our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
we have made significant capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the expansion of our facilities  including the expansions of our facilities located in iowa city  iowa and dayville  connecticut during fiscal we recently expanded our midwest operations by opening a new  square foot distribution center in greenwood  indiana in august  which will serve as a distribution hub for our customers in illinois  indiana  ohio and other midwest states 
in march  we announced the purchase of a new distribution center in rocklin  california and our plans to move our auburn  california operations to this facility by october the rocklin facility is  square feet and will serve as a distribution hub for customers in northern california and surrounding states 
the rocklin distribution center will also be the largest facility in our nationwide distribution network 
we expect the efficiencies created by opening the greenwood facility and by relocating from two facilities in auburn  california to a single distribution center in rocklin  california will take approximately nine to twelve months to fully manifest themselves in the form of lower operating expenses relative to sales over the long term 
having completed the iowa city and dayville facilities expansions  and with the opening of the new facilities in greenwood  indiana and rocklin  california  we will have added approximately  square feet to our distribution centers since fiscal  representing a increase in our distribution capacity 
our current capacity utilization is 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural and organic products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
net sales also consist of amounts due to us from customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by us for shipping and handling  depreciation for manufacturing equipment at our manufacturing subsidiary  hershey imports  and consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products 
total operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on our outstanding indebtedness  interest income  the change in fair value of financial instruments and miscellaneous income and expenses 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that may include all costs related to their distribution network in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses 
we include purchasing and outbound transportation expenses within our operating expenses rather than in our cost of sales 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the following i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserves for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and  respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance of doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and  respectively 
insurance reserves it is our policy to record the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment losses are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business 
the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 
for reporting units that indicated potential impairment  we determined the implied fair value of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
as of july   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
total goodwill as of july  and  was million and million  respectively 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  gaap basis excluding special items net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense change in value of financial instruments other  net total other expense income before income taxes income taxes net income total reflects rounding year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july   from billion for the year ended july  this increase was due to organic growth in our wholesale division of  the implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets in the third quarter of fiscal and the inclusion of sales related to select nutrition and roots fruits that were not included in fiscal our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share through our focus on service and added value services  and the expansion of our existing distribution centers  which allows us to carry a broader selection of products 
for the year ended july   we experienced growth in all customer channels with the most significant growth in the supernatural chains customer channel  which consists of sales to whole foods market and wild oats markets 
whole foods market accounted for approximately of our net sales during the years ended july  and in january  we entered into a five year distribution agreement as the primary distributor for wild oats markets 
for the year ended july   wild oats markets accounted for approximately of our net sales 
the following table lists the percentage of sales by customer channel for the fiscal years ended july  and customer channel percentage of net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other the shift to supernatural chains sales from independently owned natural products retailers in fiscal was the result of a full year of sales to wild oats markets following the implementation of the primary distribution agreement in the third quarter of fiscal gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the change in our sales channel mix to supernatural chains  as we implemented our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets during the third quarter of fiscal in addition  we initiated an aggressive product rationalization program in the second quarter of fiscal which continued through the fiscal year 
as our sales channel mix has shifted  we expect gross margins to be in the low percent range in the future 
operating expenses our total operating expenses  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our total operating expenses  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  special items are discussed below under special items 
the increase in total operating expenses for the year ended july  was due to the increase in our infrastructure to support our continued sales growth  an increase in fuel costs as a percentage of net sales of basis points and the inclusion of operating expenses related to select nutrition that were not included in the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special items  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  including special items  decreased from for the year ended july  to for the year ended july  the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and wages as a percentage of net sales due to improved operating efficiencies and sales growth 
the improved operating efficiencies were a result of our recent facility expansions and recent integration of management information systems following our fiscal acquisition of blooming prairie cooperative  a distributor of natural foods and related products 
the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by higher fuel costs and the inclusion of more than seven months of operating expenses related to select nutrition that were not included in the year ended july  total operating expenses for the year ended july  included a special item of million for certain non recurring labor and other costs associated with the discontinuance of the use of our mounds view  minnesota facility for broadline distribution  the closing of our hawaii facility and million in costs related to the opening of the greenwood  indiana facility 
total operating expenses for the year ended july  included a special item of million in start up and transition costs for certain equipment rental and labor costs incurred in connection with the implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets 
special items may include labor  moving and other costs related to the expansion of our distribution facilities 
however  at this time we do not know the extent or significance of these items or whether we will in fact incur any of these or other special items 
operating income operating income  excluding the special items discussed below under special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income  excluding special items  was for the years ended july  and excluding special items  the impact of increased fuel costs  the operating loss from select nutrition  and the costs incurred to comply with sarbanes oxley  our operating margin would have been approximately 
operating income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or of sales  for the year ended july  from million  or of sales  for the year ended july  other expense income other expense income decreased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  interest expense for the year ended july  decreased to million from million in the year ended july  the decrease in interest expense was due to a combination of the novation of two of our interest rate swap agreements in december  as further discussed below under special items  and a reduction in the interest rates on our borrowings under the credit facility  both of which served to lower our effective interest rate 
other expense income included a special income item of million related to the early termination of an interest rate swap agreement 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes 
net income net income  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of to for fiscal  excluding any potential special items 
special items special items for fiscal included i certain costs associated with the discontinuance of the use of our mounds view  minnesota facility for broadline distribution and closing the hawaii facility  ii certain costs associated with opening the new greenwood  indiana facility  and iii other income related to the early termination of the interest rate swap agreement on july   which was originally entered into in may special items for the fiscal year ended july  included i start up and transition costs of the wild oats markets primary distribution agreement consisting of certain equipment rental and labor costs and ii non cash income from the change in fair value on interest rate swap agreements which were caused by favorable changes in interest rate yield curves 
in december  we assigned and transferred all of our obligations of our two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party 
as a result of this novation  these ineffective swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future fiscal periods 
these ineffective swaps were included as a special item through the second quarter of fiscal we entered into interest rate swap agreements in october  august and may the october and august agreements were ineffective hedges as a result of the options held by the counter parties that could extend the original term of the interest rate swap agreements 
applicable accounting treatment required that we record the changes in fair value of the october and august agreements in our consolidated statement of income  rather than within accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of stockholders equity 
the changes in fair value are dependent upon the forward looking yield curves for each swap 
the may agreement was an effective hedge and therefore did not require this treatment 
we believe that our october and august agreements were special items that are excludable as non recurring items 
first  we only intend to enter into effective hedges going forward 
this stated intention began with the may agreement 
second  we believe that the october and august agreements may distort and confuse investors if the change in fair value cannot be treated as a special item because their inclusion directly impacts our reported earnings per share 
a change in fair value  whether positive or negative  can significantly increase or decrease our reported earnings per share 
for example  we recorded a positive change in fair value for the second quarter of fiscal that increased our diluted earnings per share by  and in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a negative change in fair value that decreased our diluted earnings per share by 
if we were prohibited from excluding this item as a special item  it would artificially inflate our reported earnings per share and thereby mislead investors as to our results of operations and our financial condition 
we believe that the start up and transition costs of the wild oats markets primary distribution agreement were special items  as we expected to generate net sales that represented approximately of our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  as a result  we needed to hire and train additional employees and rent extra equipment beyond existing capacity for training purposes in order to be prepared to assume the role of primary distributor on the dates specified in the agreement 
we believe these costs are non recurring in nature and comply with the restrictions in item e ii b of regulation s k regarding adjusting non gaap measures for the following reasons we had not incurred a similar charge relating to a new primary distribution arrangement in the prior two fiscal years 
we had previously incurred charges relating to the loss of our primary distribution relationship with wild oats markets  but  given the five year term of the distribution agreement between wild oats markets and the other distributor  we did not foresee that charges relating to this relationship would be incurred for at least five years  if ever 
our new agreement with wild oats markets entered into in january is for a five year period  and we did not foresee any additional similar charges during that period 
with the signing of this agreement  we currently serve as the primary distributor for two of the largest natural and organic retail markets  whole foods market and wild oats markets 
we are not aware of any other existing natural and organic retail customers that could individually have an impact in excess of on our revenues 
as a result  it would be unlikely that we would incur substantial additional costs to transition to the role of primary distributor for any other customer  unless the customer s business was concentrated within a limited geographical area 
the following tables detail the amounts and effect of these special items and the reconciliation of net income  excluding special items non gaap basis  to net income  including special items gaap basis for the years ended july  and year ended july  pretax income net of tax per diluted share in thousands  except per share data net income  excluding special items special items income expense related to the closing of the mounds view  minnesota facility included in operating expenses related to the closing of the hawaii facility included in operating expenses related to the opening of the greenwood  indiana facility included in operating expenses termination of interest rate swap agreement included in other income  net net income  including special items year ended july  pretax income net of tax per diluted share in thousands  except per share data net income  excluding special items special items income expense wild oats markets  inc primary distributorship transition related costs included in operating expenses interest rate swap and related option agreements change in fair value of financial instruments net income  including special items all non gaap numbers have been adjusted to exclude special items 
a reconciliation of specific adjustments to gaap results for the year ended july  and the same period last year is included in the financial tables shown above 
a description of our use of non gaap information is provided under use of non gaap results below 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  this increase was due to our organic growth and the implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets during the third quarter of fiscal growth in the independently owned natural products retailers and mass market distribution channels was approximately and  respectively  compared to the same period in the prior year 
growth in the supernaturals distribution channel was approximately compared to the same period in the prior year 
fiscal sales growth excluding the effect of sales to wild oats markets was 
sales to our largest customer  whole foods market represented approximately and of net sales for the years ended july  and  respectively 
gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the change in our sales mix to supernaturals  as we implemented our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets during the second half of fiscal operating expenses our total operating expenses  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our total operating expenses  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special items  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  including special items  decreased from for the year ended july  to for the year ended july  special items are discussed below under special items 
the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to an increase in our infrastructure to support our continued growth 
operating expenses for the year ended july  included million in special items related to start up and transition costs for certain equipment rental and labor costs incurred in connection with the implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets 
the primary drivers of the increase in operating expenses were compensation and benefit expenses due to the increase in personnel 
transportation  fuel expense and utilities costs continued to be incurred at levels consistent with the prior year as a percentage of sales 
operating expenses for the year ended july  included special items of million related to a goodwill impairment charge to our hershey imports subsidiary  million in costs incurred related to the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution center  million in restructuring and asset impairment charges and million in costs related to the loss of a major customer

the decrease in interest expense was due to the novation of two of our interest rate swap agreements in december  which served to lower our effective interest rate  partially offset by higher debt levels in fiscal as a result of our acquisitions of blooming prairie and northeast cooperative in fiscal and an increase in inventory levels to support the growth in our business 
other expense income  including the change in fair value of financial instruments  decreased or million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the change in the fair value on our interest rate swap agreements and related option agreements 
as further discussed below under special items  on december   we assigned and transferred all of our obligations of our two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of million plus accrued interest 
as a result of this assignment  these ineffective swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future fiscal periods 
these ineffective swaps were included as a special item through the second quarter of fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes

special items for the year ended july  included i a goodwill impairment charge  inventory write down and restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our subsidiary  hershey imports  ii moving and other costs related to the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution facility  iii costs related to the loss of a major customer and iv a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves 
on december   we assigned and transferred all of our obligations of our two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of million plus accrued interest 
these ineffective swaps were included as a special item through the second quarter of fiscal we entered into interest rate swap agreements in october  august and may the october and august agreements were ineffective hedges as a result of the options held by the counter parties that could have extended the original term of the interest rate swap agreements 
applicable accounting treatment required that we record the changes in fair value of the october and august agreements in our consolidated statement of income  rather than within other comprehensive income in our statement of stockholders equity 
the changes in fair value were dependent upon the forward looking yield curves for each swap

a description of our use of non gaap information is provided under use of non gaap results below 
liquidity and capital resources we finance operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  operating leases  trade payables  bank indebtedness and the sale of equity and debt securities 
on april   we entered into an amended and restated four year million revolving credit facility with a bank group that was led by bank of america business capital formerly fleet capital corporation as the administrative agent 
the amended and restated credit facility provides for improved terms and conditions that provide us with more financial and operational flexibility  reduced costs and increased liquidity 
the credit facility replaced an existing million revolving credit facility 
our amended and restated secured revolving credit facility allows for borrowing up to million  on which interest accrues at libor plus 
the million credit facility matures on march  this increased credit facility supports our working capital requirements in the ordinary course of business and provides capital to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million  with remaining availability of million 
in april  we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released in accordance with an amendment to the loan and security agreement related to the revolving credit facility 
the million term loan is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrued at libor plus 
in december  we amended this term loan agreement by increasing the principal amount from million to million under the existing terms and conditions 
on july   we entered into an amended term loan agreement which increased the principal amount of this term loan from million up to million and decreased the rate at which interest accrues to libor plus 
as of july   million was outstanding under the term loan agreement 
we believe that our capital requirements for fiscal will be between and million  and that we will finance these requirements with cash generated from operations and the use of our existing credit facilities 
these projects will provide both expanded facilities and technology that will provide us with the capacity to continue to support the growth and expansion of our customers 
we believe that our future capital requirements will be similar to our anticipated fiscal requirements  as a percentage of revenue  as we continue to invest in our growth by upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our facilities 
future investments in acquisitions will be financed through either equity or long term debt negotiated at the time of the potential acquisition 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july  and was principally the result of net income and the change in cash collected from customers  net of cash paid to vendors  and a million increase in inventory 
the increase in inventory levels primarily relate to preparing the greenwood  indiana facility for opening in august and supporting increased sales with wider product assortment and availability 
days in inventory improved to days at july  compared to days at july  days sales outstanding remained consistent at days at july  and net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july  and was principally due to the change in cash collected from customers  net of cash paid to vendors  partially offset by increased inventory levels of million as a result of increased sales 
working capital increased by million  or  to million at july   compared to working capital of million at july  net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended july  compared to million for the year ended july  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of roots fruits in july  the acquisition of select nutrition in december  the purchase of the rocklin  california facility in march and the expenditures related to opening the rocklin  california and greenwood  indiana facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july  and was due primarily to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility  primarily to finance the purchase of the rocklin  california facility  the expenditures related to opening the rocklin  california and greenwood  indiana facilities  and the acquisitions of select nutrition and roots fruits  and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
this was partially offset by repayments on our long term debt and capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july  due to borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility  additional long term debt and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayments of our long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provided for us to pay interest for a five year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
this swap had been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing the effective rate at 
in october  the counter party exercised its option to extend the original five year term of the swap agreement to seven years 
the inclusion of this option prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective august the additional agreement provided for us to pay interest for a four year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the four year term of the swap agreement could have been extended to six years at the option of the counter party  which prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas the swap had been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing the effective rate on the notional amount at 
if libor exceeded in a given period  the agreement was suspended for that period 
on december   we assigned and transferred all of our obligations of our two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of million plus accrued interest 
these ineffective swaps were included as special items for the first two quarters of fiscal in may  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement 
the agreement provided for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
libor was as of july  the swap agreement qualified as an effective hedge under sfas on july   this agreement was terminated due to the amendment to our term loan agreement 
income of million was recorded as a special item in other expense income related to the termination of this agreement for the year ended july  in august  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective july  this agreement provides for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount

in addition  cash to be paid for income taxes is excluded from the table above 
outstanding commitments as of july  for the purchase of inventory and fuel were approximately million and million  respectively 
we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million at july  impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass along inflation related increases to our customers 
consequently  inflation has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations or profitability 
seasonality generally  we do not experience any material seasonality 
however  our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses  management s ability to execute our operating and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages and general economic conditions 
recently issued financial accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
additional guidance to assist in the initial interpretation of sfas r was subsequently issued by the securities exchange commission in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sfas r requires that we  among other things  measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in the consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas r were effective for us beginning august  we continued to apply the accounting provisions of apb opinion in accounting for our share based compensation plans through july  we intend to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method of transition 
this method will require us to apply the provisions of sfas r to new awards and to any awards that are unvested on the effective date and will not require us to restate prior periods 
compensation cost for the unvested awards will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for our pro forma disclosures that had been required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
some of our share based compensation plans have a retirement eligible provision  whereby awards granted to employees who have reached the age of and who have provided five years of service  automatically vest when they retire from our company 
for these awards  we have previously followed the nominal vesting period over a four year service period approach in our pro forma disclosures 
on adoption of sfas r  new awards will be subject to the non substantive vesting period approach 
under this approach  we will recognize the compensation costs for the awards when the employee is no longer required to provide any additional service to retain the award 
additionally  sfas r requires that estimated forfeitures be considered in determining compensation cost 
as previously permitted  we recorded forfeitures when they occurred 
the disclosure in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements under note m  stock based compensation  of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had recognized compensation cost for share based payments under sfas for periods prior to fiscal is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for share based payments under sfas r in future periods 
the potential impact of adopting sfas r on fiscal s results of operations and earnings per share is dependent on several factors including the number of options and shares of restricted stock granted in fiscal  the fair value of those options and shares  which will be determined at the date of grant  the related income tax benefits recorded and the number of diluted shares outstanding 
use of non gaap results financial measures included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap are referred to as non gaap financial measures 
to supplement our financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we use non gaap additional measures of operating results  net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude special items 
we believe that the use of these additional measures is appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future as these special items are not expected to be part of our ongoing business 
the adjustments to our gaap results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and its marketplace performance 
for example  these adjusted non gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
a comparison and reconciliation from non gaap to gaap results is included in the tables above 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below as well as any cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we do not undertake to update any information in the foregoing reports until the effective date of our future reports required by applicable laws 
any projections of future results of operations should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur 
these projections are subject to change and could differ materially from final reported results 
we may from time to time update these publicly announced projections  but we are not obligated to do so 
acquisitions we continually evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies 
we believe that there are risks related to acquiring companies including overpaying for acquisitions  losing key employees of acquired companies and failing to achieve potential synergies 
additionally  our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers 
a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
successful integration of mergers is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
integration requires  among other things maintaining the customer base  optimizing of delivery routes  coordinating administrative  distribution and finance functions  and integrating management information systems and personnel 
the integration process has and could divert the attention of management and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining companies has and could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
there can be no assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of mergers 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
there can be no assurance that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than us  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
we depend heavily on our principal customers our ability to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with our two largest customers  whole foods market and wild oats markets  is an important element to our continued growth 
in december  we announced a definitive three year distribution agreement with whole foods market  which commenced on january   under which we will continue to serve as the primary us distributor to it in the regions where we previously served 
whole foods market accounted for approximately of our net sales during the years ended july  and in january  we entered into a five year distribution agreement  as primary distributor  with wild oats markets 
for the years ended july   wild oats markets accounted for approximately of our net sales 
as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from either of these customers including from increased distribution to their own facilities  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
we cannot assure you that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of supernatural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts  and we experience pricing pressures from both ends of the supply chain 
our operations are sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  difficulties with inventory control  competitive pricing pressures  and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
we cannot assure you that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
increased fuel costs increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the high cost of diesel fuel can also increase the price we pay for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers 
these factors  in turn  may negatively impact our net sales  margins  operating expenses and operating results 
to manage this risk  we periodically enter into heating oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our projected diesel fuel requirements 
heating crude oil prices have a highly correlated relationship to fuel prices  making these derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of diesel fuel 
we do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of richard antonelli president of united distribution  daniel v 
atwood senior vice president of marketing and secretary  michael d 
beaudry vice president of distribution  thomas a 
dziki division president gary a 
glenn vice president of information technology  barclay hope president of albert s organics  rick d 
puckett vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer  mark e 
shamber vice president and corporate controller  steven h 
townsend chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other key management employees 
loss of the services of any officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to demand for natural products  changes in our operating expenses  including in fuel and insurance  management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  personnel changes  supply shortages  general economic conditions  lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration regulate our trucking operations 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of july   we had approximately  full and part time employees 
an aggregate of approximately  or  of the employees at our auburn  washington  iowa city  iowa and edison  new jersey facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
these agreements expire in march  june and june  respectively 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
access to capital and the cost of that capital we have a secured revolving credit facility  with available credit under it of million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on march  as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million  with remaining availability of million 
in april  we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released in accordance with an amendment to the loan and security agreement related to the revolving credit facility 
the million term loan was repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrues at libor plus 
in december  we amended this term loan agreement by increasing the principal amount from million to million under the existing terms and conditions 
on july  we amended the term loan agreement  increasing the principal amount from million to a maximum of up to million 
the amended term loan accrues interest at libor plus  and is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule  with all other terms and conditions remaining unchanged 
as of july   million was outstanding under the term loan agreement 
in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital 
in the event that our cost of capital increases or our ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital is limited  we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations 
beginning in  we began managing portions of our debt portfolio by using interest rate swaps to achieve a desired mix of fixed rates 
at july   we had one interest rate swap relating to our million term loan agreement 
we account for our interest rate swap agreement entered into during august swap using hedge accounting treatment as the derivative has been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on an amortizing notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same amortizing notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
under this method of accounting  at july   we had not recorded an asset or liability as the interest rate swap agreement was entered into on august   with an effective date of july  as such  the fixed rate in the agreement represented fair value on that date 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading purposes 
at july   we had long term floating rate debt of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of total debt 
at july   we had floating rate debt of million and fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of total debt 
holding other variables constant such as swaps and debt levels  a basis point change in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately  and  at july  and  respectively 
at july  and  the after tax earnings and cash flows impact for fiscal resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately  and  respectively  holding other variables constant
