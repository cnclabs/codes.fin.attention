critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to percentage of completion  uncollectable accounts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  benefit plans  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements percentage of completion the company recognizes revenue on long term equipment sales contracts using the percentage of completion method based on estimated incurred costs to the estimated total cost for each contract 
should actual total cost be different from estimated total cost  additional or a reduction of cost of sales may be required 
uncollectable accounts the company maintains allowances for uncollectable accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
should non payment by customers differ from the company s estimates  a revision to increase or decrease the allowance for uncollectable accounts may be required 
inventories the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the carrying value of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment annually for goodwill and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable for other intangible assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
warranty obligations the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including evaluating the quality of the component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates 
should actual product failure rates differ from the company s estimates  revisions to increase or decrease the estimated warranty liability may be required 
benefit plans the company is required to make estimates and assumptions to determine benefit plan liabilities  which include investment returns  rates of salary increases and discount rates 
during and  the company recorded an after tax minimum pension liability adjustment in other comprehensive loss of  and  respectively 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed annually with the assistance of external actuarial professionals and adjusted as circumstances change
