item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
references in this section to ipayment  inc  the company  we  us  and our refer to ipayment  inc 
and our direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis unless the context indicates otherwise 
executive overview we are one of the fastest growing providers of credit and debit card based payment processing services to small merchants 
as of january   we provided our services to over  small merchants located across the united states  up from over  as of january  our payment processing services enable our merchants to process both traditional card present  or swipe transactions  as well as card not present transactions over the internet or by mail  fax or telephone 
we market and sell our services primarily through over independent sales groups  which gives us a non employee  external sales force representing more than  sales professionals 
we outsource certain processing functions such as card authorization  data capture and merchant accounting to third party processors such as fdms and vital processing services  and we rely on banks such as jp morgan chase to sponsor us for membership in the visa and mastercard associations and to settle transactions with merchants 
we perform several core functions such as sales support  merchant services  underwriting  risk management and chargeback services  in our main operating centers in calabasas  california and westchester  illinois 
our strategy is to grow profitably by increasing our penetration of the expanding small merchant marketplace for payment services 
the industry for card based payments  such as credit and debit cards  by consumers in the us has steadily increased over the past ten years 
according to the nilson report  total purchases by us consumers using visa and mastercard card based systems grew from trillion in to trillion in such expenditures are expected to grow to trillion by the proliferation of credit and debit cards has made the acceptance of card based payment a necessity for businesses  both large and small  in order to remain competitive 
card based payments are gradually replacing paper based payments check and cash due to favorable demographics  with younger generations of consumers more accustomed to credit and debit cards 
the nilson report estimates card based payments will represent of all us payments by we find merchants through our independent sales groups and make occasional acquisitions on an opportunistic basis in the fragmented small merchant segment of the industry 
our operating results point to successful execution of this strategy during charge volume increased to  million in from  million in  and revenues increased to million in from million in these increases were primarily the result of acquisitions  principally the fdms agent bank portfolio purchased in december of and two businesses purchased since august the fdms merchant portfolio purchased in december of did not contribute to revenues until january of income from operations increased to million in from million in we continued to improve operational efficiency in our processing costs per transaction declined to in from in and revenues per employee average increased to  in from  in  principally as a result of our acquisition of the fdms agent bank portfolio 
interest expense declined to million in from million in  reflecting the repayment of million of debt with a weighted average interest rate of approximately in the second quarter of using proceeds from the initial public offering 
this repayment resulted in a million charge in the second quarter of due to the early extinguishment of certain debt 
the decline in interest expense was more than offset by an increase in our effective income tax rate to approximately in from approximately in  due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
net income increased to million in from million in development of our business ipayment technologies  inc  was formed in as a california corporation 
in july  ipayment technologies purchased assets from two former affiliates in exchange for the assumption of debt   in cash  a million note and the issuance of  shares of ipayment technologies common stock 
we refer to this as the caymas acquisition 
in connection with the caymas acquisition  caymas  llc purchased a majority interest in ipayment technologies 
we accounted for the caymas acquisition as a purchase allocating its investment to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the excess basis allocated to goodwill 
the caymas acquisition was completed in order to transfer ownership of certain assets owned by former affiliates of ipayment technologies  and to separate ipayment technologies from its former affiliates 
in december  ipayment technologies implemented a restructuring plan  which resulted in a reduction in overhead costs and personnel 
expenses related to the restructuring included severance and future lease costs  write downs of fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
of in february  we were formed by the majority stockholders of ipayment technologies under the name ipayment holdings  inc as a holding company for ipayment technologies and other card processing businesses 
we then appointed gregory daily as our chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
in april  we acquired a interest in ipayment technologies  and in july  we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of ipayment technologies  which then became our wholly owned subsidiary  in each case by issuing our shares to ipayment technologies stockholders in exchange for ipayment technologies shares 
in august  we were reincorporated in delaware under the name ipayment  inc and in may we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and listing on the nasdaq national market 
acquisitions since january  we have expanded our card based payment processing services through the acquisition of nine businesses  two significant portfolios and several smaller portfolios of merchant accounts  as set forth below 
these acquisitions have significantly impacted our revenues  results of operations  and financial condition 
primarily due to these acquisitions  our merchant portfolio base increased from approximately  active small merchants on january   to over  on january  including our acquisition of the fdms merchant portfolio  which did not contribute to our results of operations until january  
in addition  primarily due to these acquisitions  our revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  income from operations improved to million for  from million for net income increased to million for from million for net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for from million for the full impact of the acquisitions discussed below on our results of operations for fiscal is not fully reflected in our historical results of operations due to the recent nature of these acquisitions and their varying stages of integration 
we expect our revenues  results of operations  and net cash provided by operating activities to continue to improve in  as the full impact of these acquisitions are realized 
if we engage in fewer acquisitions in the future  the revenues attributable to new acquisitions may decline as a percentage of our total revenues 
the following table lists each of the acquisitions that we have made since january  acquired business or significant portfolio date of of merchant accounts acquisition cardpayment solutions august fdms agent bank portfolio december transaction solutions september fdms merchant portfolio december on august   we entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all the assets and to assume certain liabilities of cardpayment solutions  inc for million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at per share for an aggregate of million  plus a contingent payment based upon performance  which was subsequently paid in august cardpayment solutions is a provider of credit card transaction processing services 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method with the total consideration allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including goodwill of million and a merchant processing portfolio of million 
the operating results of cardpayment solutions from august   are included in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this report 
on december   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with fdms pursuant to which we acquired the fdms agent bank portfolio for a price of million in cash 
pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we commenced receiving revenue from these accounts on january  in order to finance the acquisition  we increased our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility from million to million 
we borrowed million under our credit facility and used available cash for the balance of the purchase price 
we are currently a customer of first data for merchant processing services 
on september   we entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all the assets of ts black and gold  lp transaction solutions 
transaction solutions is a provider of credit card transaction processing services 
consideration included cash at closing and a contingent payment based upon future performance over two years which we anticipate to be partially supported by a letter of credit 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method with the total consideration allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the operating results of transaction solutions from september   are included in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this report 
on december   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with fdms  pursuant to which we acquired the fdms merchant portfolio for a price of million in cash 
pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the acquisition of became effective on december   and we will commence receiving revenue from the merchant accounts on january  we expanded our credit facility from million to million to finance the purchase 
the transaction also strengthens our existing strategic relationship with first data s merchant services unit 
we will continue to utilize processing services from first data for the acquired portfolio 
during february  our revolving credit facility was expanded to million and is further expandable to million 
for the year ended december   revenues attributable to acquisitions were million or of our total growth in revenues over for the year ended december   revenues attributable to acquisitions were million or of our total revenue growth from if we engage in fewer acquisitions in the future  the revenues attributable to new acquisitions may decline as a percentage of our total revenues 
we accounted for all of the acquisitions described above under the purchase method 
for acquisitions of a business  we allocate the purchase price based in part on valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for acquisitions of merchant portfolios  we allocate the purchase price to intangible assets 
for companies with modest growth prospects  our purchase prices primarily reflect the value of merchant portfolios  which are classified as amortizable intangible assets 
acquisition targets we identified as having entrepreneurial management teams  efficient operating platforms  proven distribution capabilities  all of which contribute to higher growth prospects  commanded purchase prices in excess of their merchant portfolio values 
consequently  purchase price allocations for these targets reflect a greater proportion of goodwill 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting our reported results of operations and financial position 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item the critical accounting policies described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of certain provisions of sfas no 
were adopted in the third quarter of 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  and requires that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired  we perform a recoverability evaluation 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   our policy was to compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows to the carrying amount of our net assets  including goodwill  to determine if the carrying amount was not recoverable and a write down to fair value was required 
effective january   in accordance with sfas no 
 we began performing the recoverability analysis based on fair value rather than undiscounted cash flows 
the calculation of fair value includes a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
we completed the testing for impairment of goodwill as of july   using the present value of future cash flows and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount of the net assets  including goodwill of the reporting unit 
we determined that no impairment charge to goodwill was required 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  in relation to the respective projected future undiscounted cash flows  to assess recoverability 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets being evaluated 
the difference between the carrying amount of the long lived assets being evaluated and the fair value  calculated as the sum of the expected cash flows discounted at a market rate  represents the impairment loss 
we evaluated the carrying value of our intangible assets as of december  and  and determined that no impairment charge was required 
accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only 
this standard is effective as of july and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of three methods the modified prospective method  the modified retrospective method to january   or the modified retrospective method to all prior years for which sfas no 
was effective 
we have not yet determined which adoption method to utilize 
further  we have not yet decided whether we will adopt the provisions of this standard on july  as required  or earlier  as allowed 
of as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently follow apb opinion no 
which accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r fair value method will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations  although it will have no impact on our cash flows 
the exact impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be determined at this time because it will depend on the number of options issued during fiscal as well as the assumptions and valuation method used to measure compensation cost under the fair value method of accounting 
the historical pro forma income statement impact is not be indicative of future results due to the uncertainty of the number of new option grants as well as the assumptions and valuation method used 
reserve for merchant losses 
disputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  cardholder dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant s favor 
in these cases  the transaction is charged back to the merchant  which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer through the merchant s acquiring bank and charged to the merchant 
if the merchant has inadequate funds  we or  under limited circumstances  the acquiring bank and us  must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction 
we evaluate the merchant s risk for such transactions and estimate its potential loss for chargebacks based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors 
during the fourth quarter of  we benefited from a favorable nonrecurring million reduction in an earlier estimate for merchant losses from a single merchant to reflect lower actual losses 
at december   our reserve for losses on merchant accounts totaled million 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the effects of differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
at december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that will be available to offset regular taxable income through  subject to annual limitations of up to million 
we also have approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards  again subject to annual limitations  that will expire in various states between and we have placed a valuation allowance on a portion of our net deferred tax asset  which is primarily comprised of operating loss carryforwards as a result of limitations placed on the ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards due to ownership changes  which occurred prior to our initial public offering 
components of revenues and expenses substantially all of our revenues are generated from fees charged to merchants for card based payment processing services 
we typically charge these merchants a bundled rate  primarily based upon the merchant s monthly charge volume and risk profile 
our fees principally consist of discount fees  which are a percentage of the dollar amount of each credit or debit transaction 
we charge all merchants higher discount rates for card not present transactions than for card present transactions in order to compensate ourselves for the higher risk of underwriting these transactions 
we derive the balance of our revenues from a variety of fixed transaction or service fees  including fees for monthly minimum charge volume requirements  statement fees  annual fees and fees for other miscellaneous services  such as handling chargebacks 
we recognize discounts and other fees related to payment transactions at the time the merchants transactions are processed 
we recognize revenues derived from service fees at the time the service is performed 
related interchange and assessment costs are also recognized at that time 
we follow the requirements of eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining our revenue reporting 
generally  where we have merchant portability  credit risk and ultimate responsibility for the merchant  revenues are reported at the time of sale on a gross basis equal to the full amount of the discount charged to the merchant 
this amount includes interchange paid to card issuing banks and assessments paid to credit card associations pursuant to which such parties receive payments based primarily on processing volume for particular groups of merchants 
revenues generated from certain agent bank portfolios acquired as part of the fdms acquisition are reported net of interchange  as required by eitf  where we may not have credit risk  portability or the ultimate reponsibility for the merchant accounts 
the most significant component of operating expenses is interchange fees  which are amounts we pay to the card issuing banks 
interchange fees are based on transaction processing volume and are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
other costs of services include costs directly attributable to our provision of payment processing and related services to our merchants such as residual payments to isos  which are commissions we pay to our isos based upon a percentage of the net revenues we generate from their merchant referrals  and assessment fees payable to card associations  which is a percentage of the processing volume we generate from visa and mastercard 
in addition  other costs of services include telecommunications costs  personnel costs  occupancy costs  losses due to merchant defaults  other miscellaneous merchant supplies and services expenses  bank sponsorship costs and other third party processing costs 
of other costs of services also include depreciation and amortization expenses  which are recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
amortization of intangible assets resulted from our acquisitions of portfolios of merchant accounts or acquisitions of a business where we allocated a portion of the purchase price to the existing merchant processing portfolio 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages and other general administrative expenses 
seasonality trend 
our revenues and earnings are impacted by the volume of consumer usage of credit and debit cards at the point of sale 
for example  we experience increased point of sale activity during the traditional holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter 
revenues during the first quarter tend to decrease in comparison to the remaining three quarters of our fiscal year on a same store basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to effect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financials

interchange 
interchange expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of increased charge volume due to the acquisitions of businesses and portfolios of merchant contracts as previously noted 
interchange expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in  as we present revenue net of interchange for certain customers included in our acquisition of the fdms agent bank portfolio 
other costs of services 
other costs of services increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with increased charge volume related to our acquisitions 
other costs of services represented of revenues in as compared to of revenues in other costs of services as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to an increase in residuals expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the acquisitions  mainly from the fdms agent bank portfolio 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs resulting from our acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were relatively consistent at in compared to in  as lower personnel related costs as a percentage of revenues were partially offset by higher professional fees 
other expense 
other expense decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the repayment of million of debt with a weighted average interest rate of in the second quarter of using proceeds from the initial public offering

interchange 
interchange expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of increased charge volume due to the acquisitions of businesses and portfolios of merchant contracts as previously noted 
interchange expense as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in  as the acquired businesses and portfolios had higher average costs as a percentage of revenues than our existing mix of business 
other costs of services 
other costs of services increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with increased charge volume related to our acquisitions 
other costs of services represented of revenues in as compared to of revenues in other costs of services as a percentage of revenues decreased as the increase in revenues did not require a corresponding increase in other costs of services  such as merchant losses and personnel related costs 
merchant losses were of revenues in  compared to in merchant losses recognized in included a million benefit attributable to a reduction in estimated chargebacks relating to one merchant 
approximately million of estimated chargebacks for this merchant were expensed in the first half of the portion of personnel costs classified as other costs of services was approximately of revenues in compared to of revenues in the reduction was primarily due to improved efficiencies resulting from consolidation of our acquired entities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel cost resulting from our acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to in from in  primarily due to the consolidation of the operations of acquired entities  which improved operational efficiencies and resulted in a reduction in personnel related costs as a percentage of revenues 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in cash paid for interest in actually decreased due to the repayment of approximately million of debt with a carrying value of million in the second quarter of using proceeds from our initial public offering 
however  the repayment and the conversion of debt resulted in recognition of a noncash pre tax charge of approximately million of interest expense in the second quarter of due to the acceleration of interest expense equal to the unamortized discount balance at the date of repayment or conversion 
other expense 
other expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to of expenses in of million from the settlement of litigation and million related to the amendment of certain terms of the existing processing agreements and the termination of an acquisition agreement  which did not recur in income tax 
the income tax provision increased to million in from  in the increase was attributable to an increase in taxable income in from a pre tax loss in our effective income tax rate for was due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in that were previously unrecognized 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  we funded our principal operations through private placements of debt and equity securities to executive officers  directors  principal stockholders  third parties and a credit facility from bank of america 
in may  we raised net proceeds of million through an initial public offering of our common stock 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to million as of december  we had net working capital of million as of december   compared to a net working capital deficit current liabilities in excess of current assets of million at december  we believe that funds from future operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to settle our current obligations 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  consisting of net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million and noncash interest expense of million  partially offset by a net unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the net unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily caused by an increase in accounts receivable due to our increased revenues in and approximately million of capitalized debt issuance costs related to the amendment of the credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  consisting of net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million and noncash interest expense of million  partially offset by a net unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the noncash interest expense included a million charge related to the acceleration of the unamortized discount on notes payable that were repaid or converted to common stock following our initial public offering in the second quarter of the net unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily caused by the payment of approximately million of offering costs  related to our initial public offering  that were included in accounts payable at december   and an increase in accounts receivable due to our increased revenues in net cash used in operating activities was million in  consisting of a net loss of million and net unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million and noncash interest expense of million 
the net unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily included a million increase in other assets mainly caused by capitalized costs related to our initial public offering  and a million decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and reserve for merchant losses 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in cash paid for acquisitions of a business  portfolios and other intangibles was million 
these payments were partially offset by a net decrease in restricted cash of million due to funds held on deposit by a former sponsor bank that were returned to us 
total capital expenditures for were million 
these expenditures were primarily related to leasehold improvements  computers and other equipment 
we currently have no significant capital spending or purchase commitments  but expect to continue to engage in capital spending in the ordinary course of business 
net cash used in investing activities was million in cash paid for acquisitions of a business  portfolios and other intangibles was million 
restricted cash increased by million in as we escrowed a deposit of million to a former sponsor bank until completion of the conversion to our new sponsor 
total capital expenditures for were million 
these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of computers and other equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  which primarily included million paid for the acquisitions of four businesses in total capital expenditures for were million 
these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of computers and other equipment 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million of net borrowings on our credit facility 
of net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million from issuance of common stock including net proceeds of million from our initial public offering and additional net borrowings on our credit facility of million  partially offset by repayment of long term debt and capital leases of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  consisting entirely of a net increase in total debt 
as of december   we had notes  capital lease obligations and a credit facility arrangement outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of million  consisting of million outstanding under our senior credit facility and million that is convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the million consists of convertible subordinated promissory notes including million of accrued interest with an interest rate of  which may be converted into shares of our common stock at the discretion of the holders at a price per share of per share 
in december we amended our credit facility with bank of america and jp morgan chase as the lead banks 
the amendment expanded the credit facility from million to million which was subsequently expanded to million in february and is further expandable to million 
the credit facility includes a million letter of credit sublimit 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable at a rate of libor plus a margin of to currently libor plus depending on our ratio of consolidated debt to ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
we have the option to choose month  month  month or month libor rates each time we make a draw on the credit facility 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to pay unused commitment fees of up to currently on any undrawn amounts 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a debt to ebitda ratio as defined therein of less than to  as well as specified limitations on capitalization and restrictions on incurring liens and transactions with affiliates 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility at the base rate of 
this rate was converted to libor on january   at 
the amended credit facility expires on december   and all outstanding borrowings are due at that time 
the following table of our material contractual obligations as of december   summarizes the aggregate effect that these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in the periods indicated in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years credit facility convertible notes including accrued interest capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations represent costs of contractually guaranteed minimum processing volumes with certain of our third party transaction processors 
we are required to pay fdms an annual processing fee related to the fdms merchant portfolio and the fdms agent bank portfolio of at least million in  and for each subsequent year through of at least of the amount of the processing fee paid during the immediately preceding year 
the minimum commitment for years after  included in the table above are based on the preceding year minimum amounts 
the actual minimum commitments for such years may vary based on actual results in preceding years 
we also have agreed to utilize fdms to process at least of our consolidated transaction sales volume in any calendar year beginning in and continuing through the minimum commitments for such years are not calculable as of december   and are excluded from this table 
we expect to be able to fund our operations  capital expenditures and contractual obligations above using our cash from operations 
we intend to use our credit facility primarily to fund additional acquisition opportunities as they arise 
to the extent we are unable to fund our operations  capital expenditures and contractual obligations above using cash from operations  we intend to use borrowings under our credit facility or future debt or equity financings 
in addition  we may seek to sell additional equity or arrange debt financing to give us financial flexibility to pursue opportunities that may arise in the future if an opportunity that we consider attractive arises to raise additional funding 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may also decide to issue securities  including debt securities  which have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our future needs  which may prevent us from increasing our market share  capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 
of effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  are not significantly affected by inflation 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of intangible assets and goodwill  are not affected by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and telecommunications  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  which provided  among other things  immediate deferral of the application of fin for entities that did not originally qualify as special purpose entities  and provided additional scope exceptions for joint ventures with business operations and franchises 
our adoption of fin r did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination abstract eitf 
eitf requires that the consummation of a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists 
eitf should be applied to business combinations consummated and goodwill impairment tests performed in reporting periods beginning after october  amounts previously recognized as goodwill should not be reclassified as an identifiable intangible asset  however  previously recognized goodwill should be tested for impairment 
any effect on a goodwill impairment charge should be reported in operating income 
to date  we have not consummated a business combination that would fall within the scope of eitf and as such  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only 
this standard is effective as of july and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of three methods the modified prospective method  the modified retrospective method to january   or the modified retrospective method to all prior years for which sfas no 
was effective 
we have not yet determined which adoption method to utilize 
further  we have not yet decided whether we will adopt the provisions of this standard on july   as required  or earlier  as allowed 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently follow apb opinion no 
which accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r fair value method will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations although it will have no impact on our cash flows 
the exact impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be determined at this time because it will depend on the number of options issued during fiscal as well as the assumptions and valuation method used to measure compensation cost under the fair value method of accounting 
the historical pro forma income statement impact is not indicative of future results due to the uncertainty of the number of new option grants as well as the assumptions and valuation method used 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we transact business with merchants exclusively in the united states and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  because a majority of our indebtedness is at variable rates 
at december   million of our outstanding indebtedness was at variable interest rates based on libor 
a rise in libor rates of one percentage point would result in additional interest expense of million 
we do not hold derivative financial or commodity instruments  nor engage in any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in money market and checking funds
