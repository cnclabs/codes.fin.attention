overview cummins is a global power leader comprised of four reportable complementary business segments engine  power generation  filtration and other and international distributors 
our businesses design  manufacture  distribute and service diesel and natural gas engines and related technologies  including fuel systems  controls  air handling  and filtration  emissions solutions and electrical power generation systems 
our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
major oem customers include daimlerchrysler  paccar  international truck and engine corporation navistar  volvo  komatsu  ford  volkswagen  cnh global and our joint venture partners in china dongfeng cummins engine co 
ltd 
and india tata cummins limited 
we serve our customers through a network of more than company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our business units share technology  customers  strategic partners  brands and our distribution network 
our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature and varying conditions of the markets we serve  particularly the automotive  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of crude oil fuel costs  volume of freight tonnage  interest rate levels  non residential construction spending and general industrial capital spending 
economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales volume and pricing of our products and reduce earnings and cash flow 
although cyclicality is a factor in our business  the financial impact of it has been reduced somewhat by our geographical expansion  growth in our distributor business and improvements in our fixed cost structure that have resulted in a lower break even point of our production costs 
financial overview the table below sets forth our consolidated statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december net sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expenses research and engineering expenses equity  royalty and other income from investees restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits interest expense loss on early retirement of debt other income  net earnings before income taxes  minority interests  dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles provision benefit for income taxes minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles cumulative effect of change in accounting principles  net of tax net earnings cummins experienced very strong performance in with record sales and earnings 
net earnings were million  or per share  on sales of billion  compared to net earnings of million  or per share  on sales of billion 
the earnings improvement was driven by a percent increase in net sales  primarily from our engine business and record sales at our power generation business 
both segments experienced strong demand across respective automotive and industrial markets  with particularly strong demand in the north american heavy duty truck market where engine sales were up percent from the prior year and our market share increased significantly 
sales also increased in the filtration and other and international distributor businesses in compared to reflecting substantial improvement in demand and business conditions 
our joint ventures contributed million in earnings in compared to million in  with the largest increase from our expanded joint venture in china  dongfeng cummins engine company dcec 
overall  was an exceptionally strong financial year for cummins and we believe the programs we have in place position us for another good year in business outlook our engine business experienced much stronger than expected volumes in virtually all of its markets in and most economic indicators point toward continued improvement at a moderate pace in the north american heavy duty truck market in we currently expect north american heavy duty truck production levels to increase a minimum of percent  from an estimated  units in to approximately  to  units in while demand was driven partially from fleets adding capacity as freight volume increased  the majority of the increase resulted from the replacement of aging vehicles 
in  we expect demand will be driven primarily by the economy as manufacturing and consumer spending levels increase and trucking fleets expand their capacity by adding equipment 
we also expect sales of our midrange engines to the medium duty markets to increase in  as economic indicators for this market historically correlate with those of the heavy duty market 
currently  we estimate our engine volumes for the worldwide medium duty truck market to increase percent in  including an increase in market share 
sales of our liter turbo diesel engine to daimler chrysler for the dodge ram truck reached record levels in and we expect volumes will increase with the scheduled availability of our engine in the new dodge ram mega cab 
we expect the dodge ram heavy duty cummins turbo will continue to result in strong sales volumes as demand for diesel powered light vehicles increases 
our industrial markets also experienced a strong recovery in and continued growth is expected through  particularly overall demand from construction and mining oems 
our power generation business struggled financially in and as demand for global power generation declined  resulting in high inventory levels  over capacity and market pricing pressures 
in  profitability returned to this segment based upon strong demand for commercial products in china and the middle east  a significant increase in alternator sales to generator set oems  record sales of onan branded generator sets to rv oems  our focus on cost reduction initiatives  benefits from restructuring and new product introductions 
in  we expect continued growth in commercial international markets for power generation and alternators and stronger growth in domestic markets 
in our consumer business  we expect two new product launches  a portable generator set and a residential standby generator set  to offset a slight volume decline in rv generator sets 
overall  power generation revenues are expected to increase in with improved profitability for this segment 
in our filtration and other business  our long term agreements with key customers executed in and provided excellent revenue growth in although our financial results were impacted by the dramatic rise in steel prices and capacity constraints in our exhaust manufacturing 
we expect revenue growth to continue in and we also expect some growth in aftermarket revenues from new products released in revenue from our emission solutions business is expected to increase in as we continue to gain market share in the domestic retrofit business 
overall  filtration and other business revenues are expected to increase approximately percent in  and profitability is expected to improve as a result of cost reduction initiatives and the impact of pricing actions to offset steel cost increases 
in  revenues improved in every geographic region and profitability was up significantly in our international distributor business 
as the worldwide economy continues to improve and our engine population increases  we expect sales growth in engines  parts  service and power generation equipment and solid profit margins to continue in this business as we capitalize on a growing global customer base 
we expect revenues to increase over percent in from economic growth and increased profitability from higher sales volume  managed expenses and planned consolidations 
income from our joint ventures is expected to continue to be strong in  particularly in asia  through our partnership  dcec  which is a supplier to the second largest truck manufacturer in china  and in north america through our distributorship joint ventures 
we expect our businesses to generate sufficient cash from operations in to fund capital expenditures  research and development  pension funding  debt service costs and dividend payments 
in addition  we expect cash outflows to fund our joint ventures will approximate million in we have available various short and long term credit arrangements  which are discussed below and disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these credit arrangements and other programs  such as our accounts receivable program  provide the financial flexibility  when needed  to satisfy future short term funding requirements of our debt service obligations and projected working capital requirements 
on march   we repaid our million notes on their maturity date from cash and cash equivalents on hand 
with the exception of payments required under various operating and capital leases  principal and interest payments on notes issued by a consolidated vie and our pension funding commitments  there are no major fixed cash payment obligations occurring until when our notes with principal amount of million mature 
significant events  transactions and financial trends throughout this management s discussion and analysis we have disclosed significant events or transactions that had a material impact on our net earnings or segment ebit  financial position and cash flows 
in  our net earnings benefited from significant tax events that likely will not recur with similar materiality or impact on our effective tax rate 
our tax expense was reduced by the following nonrecurring benefits we reassessed the treatment of foreign tax credits previously recognized as tax deductions and used them as tax credits million  we amended prior years us income tax returns and claimed additional export tax benefits million  we reversed valuation allowances related to state tax net operating losses that were no longer needed million  and we reduced our tax expense for a change in the estimated state income tax rate used to value deferred tax assets million 
other significant events and transactions that occurred during were we adopted certain provisions of fin r as of march   which required us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of three variable interest entities previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as of april   we consolidated another entity under the provisions of fin r 
after eliminating intercompany transactions  our assets and liabilities as of december   increased million and million  respectively  and our net sales  gross margin and net earnings increased million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our gross margin and net earnings were negatively affected by the rising cost of steel and other commodities  primarily copper  manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies due to significant increases in production and supplier constraints to meet growing demand 
steel prices increased percent during and it is likely they will remain high in the first half of although we expect increases to be less significant than those experienced in while our primary focus remains on controlling our costs through cost reduction efforts and six sigma projects  we have implemented pricing actions in our businesses to offset our current estimate of the impact of commodity prices in in addition  we have engaged in detailed capacity and throughput analysis work with many of our key suppliers to help them manage capacity constraint issues and have also developed a recovery plan to address our manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies 
during we amended the master lease agreements related to two leases representing a majority of equipment leased in our powerrent program 
one of the lease amendments required us to retain full residual risk on the equipment and the other required us to repurchase the equipment at the end of the two year non cancelable lease terms 
as a result  both leases are now classified as capital leases 
the total addition to our consolidated balance sheets as property  plant and equipment relating to the capital leases was million and the balance of the capital lease obligations at december   was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
million pre tax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in and significant transactions included in earnings were million pre tax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in and  and million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
significant transactions included in earnings were million tax adjustment credit related to the settlement of us income tax audits for the years through  million credit for excess costs of restructuring actions  million pre tax charge related to early extinguishment of debt  million pre tax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in and  and million after tax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to changing our pension measurement date 
results of operations net sales net sales of our business segments for the years ended december  follows millions engine power generation filtration and other international distributor elimination of intersegment sales total consolidated net sales sales of our engine business increased  million  or percent percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under business segment results  compared to the prior year  primarily due to strong demand from heavy and medium duty truck oems  increased shipments to chrysler of light duty engines for the dodge ram truck and higher engine shipments to industrial oems 
engine and part sales to automotive markets were percent higher than with increased shipments in all market segments  except bus applications 
power generation sales increased million  or percent  percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under business segment results compared to the prior year  buoyed by strong demand for generator sets and alternators in international markets and continued robust demand for rv and other consumer power generation products 
sales in the filtration and other business were up million  or percent  percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under business segment results compared to the prior year  with improvements in most markets  but primarily driven by north american oems 
sales in our international distributor business increased million  or percent  compared to  with moderate growth in engine  parts and service and strong demand for power generation products 
total sales in increased approximately million from the consolidation of entities under fin r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sales increased in all of our business segments in compared to  with a majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year as economic conditions strengthened and overall demand for our products improved 
engine business sales increased million  or percent  primarily from higher engine sales to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck 
power generation sales increased million  or percent  compared to the prior year  buoyed by strong fourth quarter demand 
sales in the filtration and other business exceeded the billion level  up million  or percent year over year  reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration 
sales in our international distributor business increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily from strong sales of engines and parts at our distributorships in australia  dubai and south africa 
gross margin our gross margin was  million in compared to  million in  with related gross margin percentages of and  respectively 
the majority of the change in year over year gross margin was a result of the following higher engine shipments  particularly to the north american automotive and industrial markets  higher sales across our other three businesses million  and related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs million  increased product coverage costs due to higher volumes million  higher material costs for copper and steel  net of price realization million  supplier inefficiencies resulting from higher volumes  including premium freight charges and overtime million  the impact of favorable currency exchange rates million  and one time charge for inventory valuation million 
approximately percent of the increase in gross margin was a result of consolidating entities under fin r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
product coverage expense as a percent of net sales was percent in compared to percent in in the fourth quarter we revised our definition of product coverage expense to include only the cost of base engine warranty and exclude the costs of other marketing and extended warranty programs  the majority of which are purchased by customers 
in our view  this definition is a more relevant and preferable measure than previously used and accordingly  we have presented base engine warranty expense as a percent of net sales for and on a comparable basis 
gross margin increased million in  compared to  on a net sales increase of million and the related gross margin percentages were relatively flat at percent 
the gross margin on our new emissions compliant engine models was essentially flat compared to the pre emission engines as the higher price of the new engine models was offset by incremental costs of new parts and components and higher accrual for product coverage costs 
the gross margin percentage in  however  appears lower as the gross margin dollar amount was measured against a higher sales value due to the pricing action 
base engine warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was essentially flat year over year at percent in and percent in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were  million  or percent of net sales in compared to million  or percent of net sales in  or an increase of million  or percent  year over year 
the increase was comprised of million for selling expenses including million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and million for administrative expenses including million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the year over year increase in selling expenses was a result of the following higher compensation expense and fringe benefits from incremental staffing million  increases in marketing program expenses including travel and entertainment million and other volume variable expenses that individually were not significant  and increased variable compensation from improved financial performance million 
the increase in administrative expenses was attributable to the following increased variable compensation from improved financial performance million  higher compensation and fringe benefits from incremental staffing million  and increased consulting expenses  primarily sarbanes oxley implementation costs million 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on selling and administrative expenses  primarily due to changes in the pound sterling million  australian dollar million and the euro million 
approximately million  or percent  of the increase in selling and administrative expenses resulted from consolidating entities under fin r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  selling and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales compared to million percent of net sales in included in the increase was million from the impact of foreign exchange rate changes at our foreign entities 
of the total increase  approximately million was related to selling expenses and million to administrative expenses 
the increase in selling expense was attributable to the following higher compensation expense from incremental sales staffing million  funding of growth initiatives including outside consulting services million  increases in fringe expenses including pensions million  increases in variable incentive compensation due to improved segment financial performance million  and other volume variable expenses that individually were not significant 
the increase in administrative expenses resulted from the following higher fringe benefit expenses  primarily pensions million  increases in audit and non audit services million resulting from a reaudit of the and consolidated financial statements  increases in legal fees million  higher salaries and wages from staffing increases million  and and other miscellaneous items that individually are not significant 
research and engineering expenses research and engineering expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in  or an increase of million or percent 
a majority of the increase was a result of the following increased variable compensation from improved earnings million  higher spending on and product development programs million  increased compensation and fringe benefit expenses from incremental staffing million  and other general research and developmental expenses  none of which were individually significant 
the increase includes million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and million from consolidating entities under the provisions of fin r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
research and engineering expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in  or a decrease of million 
significant items comprising the year over year change follows decreased salary and wages million  reduced spending on heavy duty development program following the introductory launch of our new emissions compliant engines in million  decreased expenses related to development costs of our european engine alliance joint venture million  partially offset by increased development work and testing on euro emissions and on tier ii and iii industrial emissions engines million  increased fringe expenses  primarily pension expense million  and other expenses that individually were not material 
equity  royalty and other income from investees earnings from our joint ventures and equity method investees were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or percent 
the year over year increase was attributable to improved earnings across most of our joint ventures  including the following our expanded joint venture in china  dcec million  our north american distributor joint ventures million  our joint venture in india  tata cummins ltd million  and cummins mercruiser  our marine joint venture million 
income from royalties and technical fees  which included a one time million fee from a china joint venture  was million in compared to million in earnings from our joint ventures and alliances were million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the year over year increase was attributable to improved earnings at most of our joint ventures including the following dcec million  north american distributor joint ventures million  the european engine alliance million  chongqing cummins engine company ltd 
million  tata holset and tata cummins ltd 
million  and cummins mercruiser million 
royalty income from joint ventures and alliances increased million in compared to restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits through the end of  we continued a restructuring program initiated in to improve our cost structure 
the charges related to this program included staffing reductions and reorganizations in various business segments  asset impairment write downs for manufacturing equipment  facility closure and consolidation costs  dissolution costs and restructuring actions related to joint venture operations  cancellation of a new engine development program and exit costs related to several small business operations 
our results included a net million credit related to restructuring programs comprised of a net million charge in the second quarter and a million reversal of excess accruals in the fourth quarter 
the second quarter charge included million for restructuring actions recognized in the quarter  offset by a million reversal of excess accruals 
the excess accruals resulted from realigning or canceling restructuring actions taken in and the million second quarter charge included the following million attributable to workforce reductions  million for asset impairment  and million related to facility closures and consolidations 
the workforce reduction included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately salaried and hourly employees and was based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations 
the overall workforce reductions were a result of closing operations and moving production to available capacity 
the asset impairment charge related to equipment available for disposal 
the carrying value of the equipment and the effect of suspending depreciation on the equipment were not significant 
in the fourth quarter of  the number and mix of employees terminated under this program differed from our original estimate and we reversed approximately million of excess accruals for severance costs and benefits 
approximately salaried and hourly employees were terminated under this plan 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a schedule that presents by major cost component  activities related to the restructuring action  including adjustments to the original charges 
all restructuring actions were completed as of december  interest expense interest expense was million in  an increase of million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the following the consolidation of entities under the provisions of fin r million  and interest related to certain capital leases for power generation equipment million 
in addition to the above  the adoption of sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity required prospective classification of dividends on our preferred securities as interest expense in our consolidated statement of earnings effective july  including dividends on our preferred securities  interest expense increased million in compared to the preferred securities are no longer reported as an obligation in our consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of fin r see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  rather  the convertible subordinated debentures issued by us and representing the sole assets of the trust issuing the securities  are now classified as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
interest expense was million in compared to million in most of the increase resulted from the following higher debt levels million  higher borrowing rates million on our senior notes issued in november  and required presentation of dividends on our preferred securities as interest expense million effective july   in accordance with a new accounting standard see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of interest paid in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
other income  net other income  net was million  million and million income in  and  respectively and includes losses on asset sales  impairment losses  foreign currency exchange  interest income  royalty income and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
other income decreased in compared to primarily due to losses on the sale of fixed assets and investment write downs  partially offset by higher royalties from increased sales volumes and higher technology income from joint venture partners 
the major components of other income and expense  segregated between operating items and non operating items  are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision benefit for income taxes our income tax provision was million in  compared to a million provision in and a million income tax benefit in the higher tax provision reflects the increase in profit before taxes 
our effective tax rate is normally below the us corporate income tax rate of percent  primarily because of research tax credits and reduced taxes on export earnings 
our effective tax rate of percent is unusually low not only because of the normal favorable effects of research credits and export tax benefits  but also because of the following nonrecurring benefits as a result of continued earnings improvement and improved economic outlook  we reassessed the treatment of and foreign tax credits previously recognized as tax deductions and determined they could be used as full tax credits 
the more favorable treatment of these credits reduced our income tax provision by million 
as a result of improved cash flow during  we filed amended us income tax returns to claim additional export tax benefits related to prior years which we had previously forgone to avoid the associated tax payments required on the non exempt export income of our foreign sales corporation 
these additional export tax benefits related to prior years reduced our income tax provision by million 
the earnings improvement also caused us to reassess our ability to realize state tax benefits from net operating losses generated in prior years 
previously  we had provided a valuation allowance to reduce the recorded tax value of these loss carryforwards to a lower estimated realizable value 
our reassessment determined that million of this allowance was no longer needed and was recorded as a reduction of our income tax expense 
in conjunction with our reassessment of the realizable value of state tax benefits  we also recognized a change in the estimated average state income tax rate used to value our deferred tax assets 
this rate change reduced our income tax expense by million 
excluding the unusual or nonrecurring benefits described above  our effective tax rate was percent 
this rate was lower than the percent us tax rate  primarily because of export tax benefits and research tax credits generated by operations 
we expect our effective tax rate to be higher than this  but still well below percent 
the american jobs creation act of phases out the export tax benefits reduced percent for that have been a key factor in our low tax rate 
however  those benefits are replaced with a new us manufacturer s tax deduction which phases in beginning in the jobs act also includes a special one year percent deduction for qualifying dividends repatriated from foreign operations 
generally  the special repatriation rules are only beneficial on very low taxed foreign earnings 
we are reviewing the possible application of the rules to some foreign joint venture repatriations that could potentially reduce our income tax provision by million to million 
the income tax benefit included a one time  million favorable tax adjustment credit related to the settlement of us internal revenue service income tax audits for tax years through the amount of income taxes paid in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a complete disclosure of our income taxes including a reconciliation of the income tax provision benefit that would be expected using the percent us federal income tax rate to the actual income tax provision benefit recorded 
minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries minority interests in our consolidated operations were million in  compared to million in and million in approximately one half of the increase in compared to resulted from higher earnings at wuxi holset ltd million  a percent owned subsidiary  and cummins india limited million  a percent owned subsidiary 
the remainder of the increase in minority interests is attributable to consolidating the results of four entities under the provisions of fin r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in compared to is a result of lower earnings at wuxi holset and cummins india limited  partially offset by income from our percent owned subsidiary in brazil  cummins powerent comericio e loca o  ltda 
dividends on preferred securities dividends on our preferred securities were million in and million in effective july   these dividends were prospectively classified as interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with sfas a description of our obligation relating to these preferred securities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principles consolidation of a variable interest entity in  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement whereby we sold and leased back heavy duty engine manufacturing equipment from a grantor trust wholly owned by a financial institution 
in december  the grantor trust  which acts as a lessor in the sale leaseback transaction  was consolidated when we adopted fin r 
under fin r  the lessor trust was deemed a variable interest entity vie and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of the trust by virtue of our guaranteeing the leased equipment s residual value 
accordingly  we recorded the cumulative effect of consolidating the vie in our consolidated financial statements as a change in accounting principle as of december   with the following impact reduced earnings million million after tax  or per share which represents the reversal of the original sale leaseback transaction as if it had not occurred  and the consolidation of the vie from the inception of the lease  and increased property  plant and equipment by a net million current carrying value as if it had been depreciated since the beginning of the lease and increased long term debt  other liabilities and minority interests by a net million 
our consolidated statement of earnings in also included interest expense on the lessor s debt of million and depreciation expense on the equipment of million rather than rent expense 
the effect of consolidating this vie in reduced our pre tax earnings by approximately million which represents the difference between the sum of interest and depreciation expense recorded in and rent expense that would have been recorded prior to consolidation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the change in accounting and note for a description of the original leasing transaction 
the consolidation of the vie did not impact consolidated statements of earnings  other than the cumulative effect at december   nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants 
change in pension measurement date during the fourth quarter of  we changed the measurement date for measuring the return on assets invested in our pension plans and the minimum liability for pension plan obligations from september to november this change in measurement date aligns more closely with our fiscal year end  and we believe provides a more current measurement of plan obligations and investment return on plan assets than previously presented 
in accordance with gaap  we have reported this change in our consolidated statements of earnings as a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative after tax effect of the change increased earnings million  or per share  and was recorded as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this accounting change 
business segment results we have four reportable business segments engine  power generation  filtration and other and international distributors 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets served by each segment and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
we evaluate the performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest  taxes  minority interests  and cumulative effect of accounting changes segment ebit and return on average net assets excluding debt  taxes and adjustments to the minimum pension liability 
prior to january   intersegment transfers between the engine segment and the power generation segment and between the filtration and other segment and the engine segment were recorded at cost and a sale was not recorded by the transferor segment 
effective january   all intersegment sales of the transferor segments were recorded at a market based transfer price discounted for certain items 
unit shipments are now also reflected in the sales volumes of the transferor segments 
certain intersegment cost allocations to the transferor segments have also been eliminated 
in addition  certain engines manufactured by the engine segment and sold to international distributors through power generation were previously recorded as a sale by power generation  however  under the new methodology power generation now records a sale commission on such sales 
we believe this change allows our segment management to focus on those pricing decisions and cost structuring actions within their control 
the impact of this change in methodology to segment results follows engine business sales increased million  filtration and other business sales increased million  power generation sales decreased million  and intersegment sales eliminations increased million 
the net impact of this change did not have a material effect on segment ebit for any of our segments 
segment results for and were not restated to reflect the change to market based transfer pricing as it was impracticable to do so 
engine the net sales and segment ebit for the engine business for the years ended december  were as follows millions net sales segment ebit net sales for this business increased  million  or percent  in compared to the increase was primarily due to the economic recovery evidenced by strong demand across all market sectors  particularly the north american heavy duty and medium duty truck markets and the light duty automotive market with record engine sales to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck 
total automotive related engine sales were percent of engine business sales in compared to percent in net sales for this business increased million  or percent in compared to the increase was primarily due to strong sales of isb engines to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck 
segment ebit increased million in  to almost five times segment ebit in the year over year improvement was primarily a net result of the following improved gross margin resulting from higher engine volumes and service part sales and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants along with the consolidation of heavy duty test and assembly operations million  increased selling and administrative expenses million and research and engineering expenses million  higher product coverage expense from increased sales volumes million  steel surcharges million from higher steel prices  and premium freight costs million 
in addition  income from joint ventures increased million compared to  primarily from higher volumes and earnings at our china joint venture  dcec  and earnings from our north american distributorships 
in  segment ebit increased million  or percent  compared to the year over year improvement in earnings was primarily a net result of the following higher earnings from joint ventures and alliances million resulting from higher sales volumes from dcec and north american distributors  increased selling and administrative expenses million resulting from higher pension cost and higher variable compensation as a consequence of earnings improvement  higher engine volumes and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants and our consolidation of heavy duty test and assembly operations million  and reduced spending for research and development following the launch of our emissions compliant engines million 
a summary and discussion of engine business net sales by market for the years ended december  follows millions heavy duty truck medium duty truck and bus light duty automotive total automotive industrial stationary power n a n a total net sales unit shipments increased  units  or percent  in compared to unit shipments a year earlier 
unit shipments in increased  units  or percent  compared to shipments 
a summary of unit shipments by engine category for the three years ended december  follows midrange heavy duty high horsepower total unit shipments heavy duty truck sales to the heavy duty truck market increased significantly in  up million  or percent  compared to the increase resulted from strong demand in the north american truck industry driven primarily by economic growth and related increase in freight tonnage and higher replacement demand for trucks 
unit shipments of heavy duty truck engines were up percent in compared to with north american shipments up percent and international shipments up percent 
in  sales to the heavy duty truck market increased million  or percent  compared to sales 
the increase was primarily attributable to a modest recovery in the north american truck industry evidenced by strong demand at the end of the year as fourth quarter sales increased percent compared to the previous quarter 
unit shipments of heavy duty truck engines declined percent in compared the decline was a result of significant pre buy activity prior to the north american october   epa emissions standards 
the volume decline in unit shipments was more than offset by higher unit pricing for our new isx and ism emissions compliant engines and higher part sales 
medium duty truck and bus medium duty truck and bus revenues increased million  or percent  in compared to shipments of medium duty truck engines were up percent to north american oems and up percent to international oems compared to the increase in medium duty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavy duty market 
worldwide shipments of bus engines were down percent in compared to most of the decline occurred in international markets with some demand recovery in china where volumes were up compared to however  lower sales to india and europe cis more than offset the increase 
in  medium duty truck and bus revenues declined million  or percent  compared to the majority of the decrease resulted from declining bus engine sales as engine sales for medium duty trucks were essentially flat compared to worldwide bus engine sales declined percent in and unit shipments were down percent  primarily in north america  due to declining market share from a major bus oem and also lower engine sales to china where sales were replaced by sales from one of our joint ventures in china 
light duty automotive sales of light duty automotive engines increased million  or percent  in compared to total unit shipments were  in  an increase of percent compared to most of the increase in light duty automotive sales was driven by strong demand from daimlerchrysler for dodge ram truck engines with record shipments of  units  or a percent increase compared to engine shipments to recreational vehicle oems decreased slightly  down percent in compared to  partially as a result of higher shipments in in advance of new product introductions and slightly lower market share in in  sales from our light duty automotive engines increased million  or percent  compared to total unit shipments in were  an increase of percent compared to the prior year 
engine shipments to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck set a record in  increasing percent  compared to the prior year  primarily driven by increased demand and market share improvement 
unit shipments of medium duty engines to the recreational vehicle market declined percent year over year  reflecting a pre buy of engine models in prior to the new emissions standards 
industrial total industrial sales to the construction  agricultural  mining  marine  government  oil and gas and rail markets increased million  or percent  in compared to unit shipments increased percent year over year reflecting a slight change in sales mix to lower priced engines 
approximately percent of the shipments were to north american markets and percent to international markets compared to percent and percent  respectively  in overall growth in industrial markets was driven by strong demand in as the capital goods sector of the economy experienced a significant recovery

liquidity and capital resources overview of capital structure cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of funding our working capital requirements 
at certain times  cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and as a result  we use periodic borrowings  primarily our accounts receivable sales program and our revolving credit facility  to fund our working capital requirements 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under our receivable sales program or our revolving credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a receivable securitization program that provided a cost effective method to fund our trade accounts receivable 
this program diversified our funding base and provided a flexible source of funding that was not reported on our balance sheet 
in december  this program expired and there were no amounts outstanding under the program at that time 
in january  we entered into a similar type of program with a different financial institution 
a more complete description of this program  which discloses certain cash flows related to the program  is found below under the caption  off balance sheet financing sale of accounts receivable and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have various short and long term credit arrangements available  which are also discussed below and disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe cash generated from operations  our credit facility arrangements and our accounts receivable program provide us with the financial flexibility required to satisfy future short term funding requirements for working capital  debt service obligations  capital spending and projected pension funding 
on march  we repaid our notes with principal amount of million from cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we believe our liquidity is adequate with cash and cash equivalents of million  million available under our new revolving credit facility and million available under our accounts receivable program see the table below under available credit capacity 
our total debt including convertible subordinated debentures was  million as of december   compared to  million  at december  total debt  including our convertible subordinated debentures  as a percent of our total capital  including total long term debt  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  included in long term debt at december  and  was million and million  respectively  attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of fin r see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
also included in short term and long term debt at december   was million from the consolidation of four joint ventures previously reported under the equity method of accounting and now consolidated under the provisions of fin r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants 
we do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods 
restructuring actions during the period  we recorded significant charges to restructure our operations  largely focused in our engine business 
these actions and the resulting charges were primarily taken in response to the downturn in the north american trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions  asset impairment losses  termination of a new engine development program and other charges 
total net cash outflows associated with these actions approximated million  including million in and million in the associated annual savings from these restructuring actions were estimated at million 
certain of these restructuring actions are also described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
all of the restructuring actions were completed as of december  available credit capacity the table below provides the components of available credit capacity as of december millions revolving credit facility international credit facilities accessible by local entities international credit facilities accessible by corporate treasury accounts receivable total available credit capacity our previous accounts receivable program expired in december and in january we entered into a new three year agreement for a similar program with a different financial institution see discussion below under the caption sale of accounts receivable 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased million during and were million at the end of the year compared to million at the beginning of the year 
cash and cash equivalents were higher in as a result of an increase in cash provided by operations generated primarily by higher net earnings 
the following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the years ended december millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities improved million in compared to  primarily due to higher net earnings million  increase in non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization expense million and pension expense million 
net changes in working capital also provided million in cash during compared to a million use in  or a net increase in cash provided by working capital of million year over year 
the increase was a result of increases in accounts payable million and accrued expenses million  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable million and inventories million 
accounts payable and inventory were higher in primarily from higher production levels necessary to meet increased demand and from the effects of consolidating entities under fin r  million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable increased due to higher sales levels and the impact of fin r million and accrued expenses increased primarily from payroll and variable compensation accruals million  pension liability million and the impact of fin r million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to the increase was due to higher capital expenditures million  increased investment in and advances to equity investees million  acquisition of a business million for purchase of a distributorship  partially offset by cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities million 
the majority of our capital spending in included equipment for new product support and capacity expansion in our engine and filtration and other segments 
our capital spending program is expected to be in the range of million to million  primarily for increased capacity and funding investment in manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to a net cash outlflow of million in  or a net change in cash inflows of million year over year 
most of the change occurred from a significant cash outflow in march from the payment of our million notes and significant cash inflows in from the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of a large number of stock options million 
cash requirements a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  as of december   is shown in the tables below contractual cash obligations after total millions loans payable long term debt and capital lease obligations operating leases capital expenditures purchase commitments for inventory other purchase commitments pension funding obligations total pension funding obligations are included only for as the amount of our funding obligations beyond the next year are not yet determinable 
other commercial commitments after total millions standby letters of credit under revolving credit agreement international and other domestic letters of credit performance and excise bonds other guarantees total financial covenants and credit rating a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements  such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale leaseback agreement  have restrictive covenants and or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating 
our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies and includes an annual assessment of the creditworthiness of our debt securities and other obligations 
it is intended to measure the probability of timely repayment of principal and interest of our notes and short term debt 
generally  a higher credit rating leads to a more favorable effect on the marketability and pricing of our debt instruments in the capital markets 
a credit rating of baa or higher by moody s or a rating of bbb or higher by standard poor s  two of the major credit rating agencies  is considered investment grade 
currently  the corporate credit rating of our debt securities is below investment grade 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides the circumstances warrant that change  and there can be no assurance that our debt ratings will not be lowered further or withdrawn by a rating agency 
any future lowering of our credit ratings could further increase the cost of our financing agreements and arrangements  and may have a negative impact on our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at current rates 
our current rating and ratings outlook from each of the credit rating agencies is shown in the table below  and remain unchanged from the prior year except each agency updated its ratings outlook from negative to stable in each rating should be viewed independently of any other rating 
credit rating agency senior l t debt rating s t debt rating outlook moody s investors service  inc ba not prime stable standard poor s bb wr stable fitch bb bb stable we do not believe a further downgrade of our credit rating will have a material impact on our financial results  financial condition or access to sufficient liquidity 
however  one of our corporate goals is to regain an investment grade credit rating from the rating agencies 
to achieve this goal  we have placed significant management focus on earnings improvement  increased cash flow and debt reduction 
the impact of credit ratings on our financing arrangements is discussed below 
new revolving credit facility in december  we entered into a new revolving credit facility 
the new facility replaced our previous million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in november deferred debt issue costs related to the previous facility were expensed in the fourth quarter and were not material 
the new facility provides for aggregate unsecured borrowings up to million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of five years 
borrowings are primarily available in us dollars  although up to million of the facility is available for multicurrency borrowings and letters of credit  up to million is available for total letters of credit and up to million is available for swing line loans 
a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the facility  although aggregate borrowings and letters of credit for our subsidiaries may not exceed million 
subsidiary borrowings under the facility are guaranteed by us and the borrowing subsidiary 
certain of those guarantees are limited by the terms of our existing public indenture which governs a number of our outstanding notes and debentures 
the indenture restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness  and their ability is also limited by similar terms in the indenture governing our million senior notes 
at our option  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the following the london inter bank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from percent to percent based on our credit rating  or the alternate base rate rate or abr which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus percent plus a spread ranging from percent to percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility 
in addition  we are required to pay quarterly fees on unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility  which are based on our credit rating  and also an annual administration fee to the administrative agent for the facility 
the terms of the revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to among other things  incur liens  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  enter into merger agreements  consolidation or asset sale transactions  dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries  incur subsidiary indebtedness and enter into speculative swap transactions 
the revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to  under the terms of our existing public indenture  re designate unrestricted subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries or designate future subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility also includes the following financial covenants which are measured quarterly the ratio of the sum of our consolidated indebtedness and our securitization financings to the sum of our consolidated ebitda for any period of four consecutive quarters may not exceed to for the periods prior to december  and may not exceed to for the periods thereafter  and the ratio of our consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to our consolidated interest expense for any period of four consecutive quarters  may not be less than to for purposes of the financial covenants described above  consolidated indebtedness  consolidated ebitda  consolidated interest expense  securitization financings  capital expenditures and other financial measurements are calculated and defined by the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement 
legal and bank facility fees of million related to this agreement were capitalized as deferred debt costs and will be amortized over the five year life of the facility 
as of december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding against this facility  no borrowings and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the agreement 
off balance sheet financing sale of accounts receivable in january  we entered into a new three year facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to cummins trade receivables  llc ctr  a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary 
as necessary  ctr may transfer a direct interest in its receivables  without recourse  to the financial institution 
to maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold  we sell new receivables to ctr as existing receivables are collected 
receivables sold to ctr in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in receivables  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
the maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr 
there are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating  however  the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as those described above under our revolving credit facility 
the interest in receivables sold under this program to the financial institution in was not significant and as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this program 
under our old program which expired on december   we had an agreement with a different financial institution where we sold a designated pool of trade receivables to cummins receivable corporation crc  a special purpose subsidiary 
under this program  crc transferred an interest in its receivables  without recourse  to limited purpose receivable securitization companies conduits that were established and maintained by an independent financial institution 
the conduits would then fund their purchases by issuing commercial paper 
no accounts receivable sold to either subsidiary were written off during  or the weighted average interest rate on securitized repayments during  and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the sold receivables servicing portfolio  which is included in receivables at december  and the proceeds from the sale of receivables and other related cash flows are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sale leaseback transactions in  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement with a variable interest entity vie whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease 
as a result of the moody s downgrade in april  and a standard poor s downgrade in october  we were required  under the lease agreement  to obtain irrevocable  unconditional standby letters of credit in an amount of million 
the letters of credit were posted to the benefit of the equipment lessor and lenders and will remain in effect until we achieve and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for consecutive months 
the sale leaseback transaction is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the grantor trust which acts as a lessor in the sale and lease back transaction discussed above was consolidated due to the adoption of fin r 
the impact of adopting fin r and a description of the entities consolidated under fin r are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the consolidation  the manufacturing equipment and the present value of the minimum lease payments were included in our consolidated balance sheets as property  plant and equipment and long term debt  respectively 
in addition  our consolidated statements of earnings includes interest expense on the lessor s debt obligations and depreciation expense on the manufacturing equipment rather than rent expense under the lease agreement 
the cumulative effect of this transaction was recorded as a change in accounting principle effective december  and reduced net earnings by million before related tax benefits of million 
the amount of interest expense and depreciation expense was million and million in  respectively 
the consolidation of the vie did not impact our credit rating or compliance with our debt covenants 
powerrent business in  our power generation business entered into an ongoing leasing program in which it built and sold power generation equipment to a financial institution and leased the equipment and related components back under a three month  noncancelable lease arrangement with subsequent renewals on a monthly basis up to a maximum of months 
the equipment was sold at cost and pursuant to lease accounting rules  the excess of the fair value of the equipment sold over its cost was recognized as prepaid rent and reflected the normal profit margin that would have been realized at the time of sale 
the margins on the equipment sales were deferred and the leases recorded as operating leases 
the prepaid rent was amortized ratably over the accounting lease term 
upon termination of the leases through a sale of the equipment to a third party  the previously deferred margins on the sale to the financial institution were recorded as income 
we sublease the equipment to customers under short term rental agreements with terms that vary based upon customer and geographic region 
in june  the master lease agreement associated with this arrangement was amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries other than the us the amendment required us to retain full residual risk on the equipment s value at the end of the non cancelable lease term 
as a result of this amendment  the leases under this program were classified as capital leases 
at the end of the non cancelable lease term  we may either extend the lease term for an additional period  repurchase the equipment at the current guaranteed value  or arrange for a sale of the equipment to a third party and pay the difference between the guaranteed value and the proceeds recovered from the sale 
during and  we entered into new leases for portions of the equipment with a different lessor million and million  respectively 
the new leases had a minimum two year non cancelable lease term with monthly renewal options for the transaction and four six month renewal options for the transaction 
the deferred margin associated with the equipment that transferred to the new lessor remained unchanged  as there was not an ultimate sale to a third party 
in december  the master lease agreement associated with these leases was also amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries outside the us this amendment required us to repurchase the equipment at the end of the two year non cancelable lease terms  and as a result  the leases were classified as capital leases 
the financial impact of amending these leasing arrangements  which represent the substantial majority of the equipment under lease in our powerrent program  resulted in an increase in our capital lease obligations by the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments  plus any guaranteed residual or repurchase obligation at the time of amendment 
in addition  we increased the amount of our property  plant and equipment by this same amount  reduced for the remaining deferred gains associated with the original sale leaseback of the units discussed above 
the equipment will be depreciated over its expected remaining useful life 
the total increase in our property  plant and equipment at the time the leases were amended was million 
the balance of the capital lease obligations related to these programs at december   was million 
future lease payments  including repurchase obligations  under each lease are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the reclassification of the leases to have a material impact on net earnings or affect compliance with any of our debt covenants 
financing arrangements for related parties in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements  we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures  sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties 
the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices 
certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost  some transfer product to us on a cost plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 
we purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines  components and service parts from consolidated diesel company cdc  a general partnership that was formed in with j 
i 
case case to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity 
cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares percent ownership in cdc 
under the terms of the agreement  cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners 
each partner is entitled to purchase up to one half of cdc s actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner s purchase requirement 
the partners are each obligated  unconditionally and severally  to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc  provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced 
the transfer price of cdc s engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period  including interest and financing expenses  but excluding depreciation expense other than scheduled depreciation expense as defined in the agreement 
in addition  each partner is obligated to contribute one half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity  which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee 
to date  neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 
we are not a guarantor of any of cdc s obligations or commitments 
however  we are required as a partner  to provide up to percent of cdc s base working capital as defined by the agreement 
the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required  the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by cdc  or we may elect to fund the requirement  although we are under no obligation to do so 
to date  when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount  we have elected to provide that funding to cdc 
if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount  it is funded equally by the partners 
excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until cdc s working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount 
any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 
in the first quarter of  we adopted certain provisions of fin r 
under the provisions of fin r  cdc and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us were considered vie s and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of these vies by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them 
as a result  we consolidated the assets and liabilities of cdc and the other engine manufacturer as of march  previously  these joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in and advances to equity investees 
first quarter results for these entities were recorded as equity  royalty and other income from investees in our consolidated statements of earnings and results for the rest of the year were consolidated in our consolidated statements of earnings 
for a further discussion of the impact of adopting fin r  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing arrangements and guarantees of distributors  residual value guarantees and other guarantees and indemnifications u 
s 
distributors since we have had an operating agreement with a financial institution that requires us to guarantee revolving loans  equipment term loans and leases  real property loans and letters of credit made by the financial institution to certain independent cummins and onan distributors in the united states  and to certain distributors in which we own an equity interest 
the agreement has been amended  supplemented or otherwise modified several times since and in the third quarter of  we amended  restated and simplified the terms of the operating agreement 
under the amended and restated terms  our guarantee of any particular distributor financing is limited to the amount of the financing in excess of the distributor s borrowing base 
the borrowing base is equal to the amount the distributor could borrow from the financial institution without a cummins guarantee 
furthermore  if any distributor defaults under its financing arrangement with the financial institution  and the maturity of amounts owed under the agreement is accelerated  then we are required to purchase from the financial institution at amounts approximating fair market value certain property  inventory and rental power generation equipment manufactured by cummins that are secured by the distributor s financing agreement 
the operating agreement will continue in effect until february   and may be renewed for additional one year terms 
as of december   we had million of guarantees outstanding under the operating agreement relating to distributor borrowings of million 
residual value guarantees leased equipment as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have various residual value guarantees on equipment leased under operating leases 
the amount of those guarantees at december   was million 
other guarantees in addition to the guarantees discussed above  from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements  including non north american distributor financing  guarantees of third party debt and other miscellaneous guarantees 
the maximum potential loss related to these guarantees was million at december  we also have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties 
the penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs 
if we were to discontinue purchasing from these suppliers as of december   the penalties would approximate million 
however  we do not anticipate paying any supplier penalties under these arrangements based on our current forecast of purchasing volumes 
indemnifications periodically we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third party against certain types of losses  including the following product liability and license  patent or trademark indemnifications as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the sold asset  and any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter party for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract 
we regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and accrue for expected losses that are probable 
because the indemnifications are not related to specific known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature  we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications 
application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
we believe the application of our accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful  reliable and timely information about our earnings results  financial position and cash flows 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap that often require management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for product coverage programs  accounting for income taxes  pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 
product coverage programs we estimate and record a liability for product coverage programs  primarily base warranty  other than product recalls  at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the time of failure 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record product coverage expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year  a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our product coverage liability account for  and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
accounting for income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company has recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets include million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a sustained level of profitability 
having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
should the company s operating performance deteriorate  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to sustain profitability include  but are not limited to  a decline in sales or gross margin  loss of market share  increased competition and existing and future regulatory emissions standards 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans in the us  the us and various other countries 
in the us and the us we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span  and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the expected rate of return on us pension plan assets used to develop our pension expense was  and for the years ended december   and the expected rate of return on non us pension plan assets was  and 
in  we plan to use an expected rate of return of for u 
s pension plan assets and for non us pension plan assets 
a lower rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
our net periodic pension expense was million in  million in and million in our net periodic pension expense is expected to be in a range of million to million in another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rate used to develop our net periodic pension expense in the us was  and for the years ended december   and the discount rate for our non us pension expense was  and 
we will use and for us and non us pension expense in changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation and due to the fact that the accumulated benefit obligation abo is calculated on a present value basis  changes in the discount rate assumption will impact the current abo 
an increase in the abo caused by a decrease in the discount rate may result in additional voluntary contributions to a pension plan as our funding strategy is to fund the plan approximately on an abo basis in the us the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 
impact on pension expense inc dec millions discount rate used to value liabilities increase decrease expected rate of return on assets increase decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
the methodology used to determine the expected rate of return on the pension plan assets in the us was based on a combination of two studies performed by independent consultants 
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
our pension plan asset allocation at december   and target allocation for are as follows target allocation percentage of plan assets at december  investment description equity securities fixed income real estate other total actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the job creation and worker assistance act of this act included temporary rules allowing companies to use  for funding purposes  discount rates for and equal to percent of the weighted average year us treasury bond yield 
during and  we made cash contributions to our pension plans of million and million  respectively  and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately million in note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of assets acquired  including goodwill  is reviewed annually 
during the review  the fair value of the reporting units to which the assets  including goodwill  were assigned was carried forward from the previous year in compliance with certain criteria set forth in sfas  except for the goodwill resulting from the consolidation of vies 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows before interest less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses  working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi year period 
additionally  management must estimate its weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate 
the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value  a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
as of the end of the third quarter in  we performed the annual impairment assessment required by sfas and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million 
changes in our projections or estimates  a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised version of fin  fin r 
we adopted the provisions of fin r in december for certain entities previously considered to be special purpose entities spes under gaap and for new entities created on or after february  the remaining provisions of fin r were adopted as of march   resulting in the consolidation of three joint ventures previously accounted for under the equity method 
in the second quarter ended june   we consolidated another entity under the provisions of fin r 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of fin r 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  fsp in response to a new law that provides a federal subsidy for prescription drug benefits under medicare to certain sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans 
this fsp requires the effects of the subsidy and expected changes in plan participation be accounted for currently as an actuarial experience gain to be recognized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants and allows several implementation alternatives 
we determined the effects of the medicare act were not material to our consolidated financial statements and therefore the adoption of fsp did not require us to remeasure our liability or expense for postretirement benefits at an interim date 
rather  the effects of the medicare act were included in the determination of our annual postretirement plan liability in november a small  grandfathered portion of our retiree population qualifies for the medicare subsidy under our current retiree health care plans 
the subsidy lowered our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo by approximately percent 
the participation in our plans could decrease if participants elect the medicare coverage 
we have modeled the sensitivity of our apbo to reflect participation changes 
if percent of our retiree population left our plan and enrolled in medicare  our apbo would be reduced an additional percent 
the net impact of the subsidy and a percent hypothetical decline in population would not have been material to our expense 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act the act was signed into law by president bush in october the act includes a special one year percent deduction for qualifying dividends repatriated from foreign operations 
generally  the special repatriation rules are only beneficial on very low taxed foreign earnings 
we are studying the possible application of these rules to some foreign joint venture repatriations up to approximately million that could potentially reduce our income tax provision by million to million 
accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead as an inventory cost 
the new statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in sfas must be applied prospectively and become effective for us beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb published sfas revised  share based payment  sfas r 
this statement requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to share based payment transactions 
share based payment transactions within the scope of sfas r include stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for the first interim period beginning after june  accordingly  we will implement the revised standard in the third quarter of currently  we account for stock based employee awards using the fair value method preferred by sfas and therefore we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement amends apb opinion  accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that have no commercial substance 
under sfas  if a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets meets a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable  the transaction must be accounted for at fair value resulting in recognition of any gain or loss 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary transactions in fiscal periods that begin after june  and becomes effective for us beginning july  we do not expect the adoption sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements certain parts of this annual report contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate and management s beliefs and assumptions 
forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words  such as anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates or similar expressions 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which we refer to as future factors  which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
future factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements are discussed below 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors that could affect the outcome of forward looking statements include the following price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  rapid technological developments of diesel engines  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products in a timely  cost effective basis  the sales mix of products  the achievement of lower costs and expenses  domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes  including environmental regulations  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  reliance on large customers  technological  implementation and cost financial risks in increasing use of large  multi year contracts  the cyclical nature of our business  the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings  continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support our future business  and other risk factors described in part i of this report under the caption risk factors relating to our business 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions  including the price of crude oil diesel fuel  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other future factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity price swaps  forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
as clearly stated in our policies and procedures  financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our international business presence 
we transact extensively in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions  we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions 
the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 
to achieve this objective  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 
in november  we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our notes that mature in the swap converted million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt that matures in the termination of this swap resulted in a million gain 
the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the amount of gain recognized during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the remaining balance of the deferred gain is included in short term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets 
in march  we terminated three fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to our notes with principal amount of million due in and notes with principal amount of million due in the termination of these swaps resulted in a million gain 
the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the amount of gain recognized during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the remaining balance of the deferred gain is included in short term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   all of our interest rate swap agreements were terminated 
commodity prices we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities  we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts  assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was not material 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the swaps  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items
