item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
overview swift operates the largest fleet of truckload carrier equipment in the united states 
we operate predominantly in one industry  road transportation  as a truckload motor carrier and thus have only one single reportable segment 
our fleet contains over  tractors and  trailers which are driven by more than  drivers and owner operators 
we earn revenue by hauling freight for retailers  manufacturers and other 
table of contents companies 
we manage our business through a network of major terminals located strategically across the united states and mexico 
this allows us to combine strong regional operations with a transcontinental van operation 
we believe our terminal network provides us with efficiencies such as enabling in house maintenance and utilizing company purchased fuel  as well as providing superior customer service by being located closer to our customers 
our services include dry van  refrigerated  flat bed  heavy haul  auto haul and dedicated van offerings 
the principal types of freight we transport include retail and discount department store merchandise  manufactured goods  paper products  non perishable and perishable food  beverages and beverage containers and building materials 
principally  we operate within short to medium haul traffic lanes with an average length of haul of less than miles 
in the past few years  the truckload industry has generally experienced increases in driver wages due to competition amongst carriers for qualified drivers  increases in fuel costs due to less efficient epa approved engines in the tractors and higher crude oil prices  and increases in insurance costs 
the availability of drivers and the cost increases have tightened the capacity growth in the industry while demand from shippers has increased 
this has enabled us and other carriers to pass through many of our cost increases to the customers through higher rates 
our ability to continue to pass through these cost increases and retain qualified drivers could have a major impact on the results of our operations and financial condition in the future 
given the current market environment  we will continue to focus on driver retention  safety  rate negotiations with our customers  freight selection and other activities that will enable us to continue our profitable growth 
sale of autohaul business and assets in the second half of  we were engaged in discussions and negotiations with potential purchasers of certain non core assets comprising our autohaul business 
at the end of the third quarter of  we reclassified these assets as assets held for sale 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a non binding letter of intent with auto carrier holdings inc ach that contemplates the sale to ach of our autohaul business and the majority of our autohaul revenue producing equipment  as well as our selkirk terminal and shop facility 
on jan 
  our board of directors authorized management to negotiate a definitive purchase agreement providing for the sale of these assets to ach for a purchase price of million  which includes combined payments of million in and days  a million note payable to swift over a six year period and the balance in cash on the closing date 
as part of this transaction  swift would also be required to provide certain bookkeeping and other related services to ach on a transitional basis 
the book value of the assets to be sold  and the value of related services  is approximately million 
based on an evaluation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we estimate that the transaction will result in a non cash charge for impairment to the book value of certain of the assets to be sold of approximately million on a pre tax basis 
this non cash charge was recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the fourth quarter of we expect this transaction to be finalized during the first quarter or early in the second quarter of  subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements  receipt of purchaser financing and other customary closing conditions 
fmcsa hours of service regulations the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa revised their hours of service hos regulations effective january to increase the maximum daily drive time from to hours  but no longer allow for breaks in the on duty period 
we believe that these changes may have caused productivity losses as there is wait time while the tractors are loaded  unloaded or otherwise detained which cannot be recovered with additional drive time 
this also has an impact on our driver wages since they are paid primarily on the number of miles driven 
in such situations  we have worked with our shippers to minimize the loss of productivity 
when necessary  we have billed our shippers and in turn compensated our drivers and owner operators accordingly so as to maintain our existing pay structure 
throughout  we have been 
table of contents successful in recovering the additional wages from our customers through accessorial charges and have not experienced a negative financial impact from these changes to date 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a decision vacating the new hos rules 
under the court s rules  fmcsa had days to seek a rehearing 
on september   congress extended the new hos rules for one year 
fmcsa officials have announced that they will continue enforcing the new hos rules during this period 
safety rating update our safety rating has always been and continues to be satisfactory  the highest rating given by federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa 
a compliance review by the arizona division of the fmcsa in has resulted in a proposed safety rating of conditional 
we filed a petition for a stay of the effective date of the proposed safety rating pending a review  which is provided for under the fmcsa regulations 
the fmcsa granted our petition for a stay 
we have petitioned for an administrative review and are engaged in the regulatory process 
we anticipate a positive outcome 
the compliance review also resulted in the assessment of civil penalties in the amount of  against swift 
swift has challenged the alleged violations and civil penalties and on june  the fmcsa assigned the civil penalties assessment to the office of hearings for review and issuance of a decision 
the agency s administrative law judge has agreed to a schedule that is anticipated to complete the hearing in december of and a final ruling is expected thereafter 
according to the fmcsa  because the civil penalties review involves many of the same issues present in the petition for administrative review of the proposed safety rating  a decision on the proposed safety rating will be issued following a final decision in the civil penalties review 
although the scope of the compliance review involved many areas within the authority of the fmcsa  there is only one issue in dispute 
this area involves the accuracy of the documentation of driving logs maintained by our drivers and owner operators 
a compliance review also resulted in the assessment of civil penalties in the amount of  against swift 
we do not believe a penalty is warranted and are engaged in the regulatory process 
recently the agency asked for summary judgment 
our attorney is analyzing the motion and we will file the appropriate response 
we anticipate a positive outcome on all three of these issues 
we have always maintained safety as a top priority and have a comprehensive internal audit program for review of driver log compliance 
in addition  we regulate the speed of our tractors and vigorously enforce a company speed limit that is lower than many state highway speed limits 
no operational safety issues have been raised by the fmcsa compliance review 
accounting standards not yet adopted by the company the financial accounting standards board has issued statements of financial accounting standard sfas and interpretations fin for which the required implementation dates have not yet become effective 
the standard that may materially impact the company is discussed below 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued 
this statement requires the cost of employee services be based upon a grant date fair value of an award as opposed to the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 which the company currently uses 
the standard is effective for the company beginning july  the company estimates the adoption of this statement will negatively impact net earnings for the year ended december  between million and million 

table of contents critical accounting policies claims accruals we are self insured for a portion of our liability  workers compensation  property damage  cargo damage and employee medical expense risk 
this self insurance results from buying insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
each reporting period we accrue the cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based upon historical claims development trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
actual settlement of the self insured claim liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  including evaluation of severity  legal cost and claims that have been incurred  but not reported 
if claims development trends increased by  our claims accrual as of december  would potentially increase by million 
goodwill and intangible assets we have million of goodwill recorded as of december  we test the goodwill  which arose from acquisitions  for impairment annually at our year end 
our test of goodwill impairment requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  which includes several significant assumptions  including estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
if operating margins decreased by for one of the reporting units  we may be required to recognize an impairment of million 
in addition  we have million of intangible assets  arising from customer relationships obtained through acquisitions and subsequent contracts  recorded as of december  we are amortizing these assets over years 
although we do not believe any event or change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  we tested these intangible assets with finite lives to provide the following information 
significant assumptions  including estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions were used to value these intangible assets 
we estimate the impact of an impairment due to the loss of one contract termination could range from million to million 
revenue recognition operating revenues and related direct costs are recognized as of the date the freight is picked up for shipment 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with method two under eitf we do not believe the financial results derived from the application of this method differ materially from the results that would be derived under method three discussed within eitf due to the company s relatively short length of haul 

table of contents results of operations for  and summary the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain statement of earnings data as a percentage of operating revenue for the years ending december operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits operating supplies and expenses fuel purchased transportation rental expense insurance and claims depreciation and amortization communications and utilities operating taxes and licenses total operating expenses operating income net interest expense other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings in  our net earnings increased to million or over this increase was primarily the result of a increase in trucking revenue and a million increase in fuel surcharge revenue which helped us recover increasing fuel costs 
in  our net earnings rose to million as trucking revenue increased and we were able to absorb more of our fixed costs 
revenue we segregate our revenue into three types trucking revenue  other revenue  and fuel surcharge revenue 
a summary our revenue generated by type for the past three years is as follows thousands trucking revenue fuel surcharge revenue other revenue total operating revenue trucking revenue trucking revenue is revenue from freight hauled by our fleet and accounts for the majority of our total revenue 
generally  our customers pay for our services based on the number of miles between pick up and delivery and other ancillary services we provide 
to improve our trucking revenue we can either increase the 
table of contents number of revenue generating miles our trucks drive or increase the rate at which we are paid 
we use three primary indicators to monitor our performance 
first  we monitor utilization of our tractors in the form of miles per tractor per week 
in conjunction with miles per tractor per week  we measure the percentage of miles our tractors travel that do not generate revenue  known as deadhead 
our goal is to minimize the amount of deadhead driven to allow for more revenue generating miles 
we monitor deadhead miles on a daily basis 
finally  to analyze the rates our customers pay we measure revenue per loaded mile on a daily basis 
loaded miles include only the miles driven when hauling freight 
to improve revenue per mile we evaluate the lanes in which we operate and negotiate higher rates per mile with our customers 
these indicators for the past three years are as follows miles per tractor per week deadhead percentage revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge revenue in addition to the rate per mile  we are also compensated  in some instances  for accessorial charges such as detention and loading and unloading freight for our customers 
these accessorial charges are also included in trucking revenue 
trucking revenue grew million or approximately in compared to increases in our revenue per mile accounted for million or of the growth 
improvements in utilization contributed or million to growth 
the acquisition of merit distribution services  inc in july of accounted for approximately of the growth  while the acquisition of trans mex in january of contributed an additional of growth 
the remaining increase was due to volume 
our trucking revenue increased by approximately in compared to our acquisition of merit distribution services  inc contributed to our revenue growth 
the increase in revenue per loaded mile accounted for of the increase of trucking revenue and improvement in our utilization accounted for an additional 
fuel surcharge revenue fuel surcharge revenue is generated based on increases in fuel costs billed to our customers 
although our surcharge programs vary by customer  prior to october we received approximately an additional penny per mile for every six cent increase in the department of energy s average diesel fuel index 
in october  we renegotiated with many of our customers to increase the charge to one penny for every five cent increase in the diesel fuel index 
in some instances  customers chose to incorporate the change by splitting the impact between the basic rate per mile and the surcharge fee 
we believe this change in policy will cover the majority of our exposure to increases in the cost of fuel 
however  there can be no assurance that such fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely 
fuel surcharge revenue increased in compared to and in compared to the department of energy diesel fuel index increased to an average of in from in and in the increase in the average cost of fuel  as well as our increase in volume and our fuel surcharge program  directly contribute to the growth in fuel surcharge revenue 
other revenue other revenue is generated primarily by freight moved for our customers on rail or other purchased transportation 
prior to  the revenue generated when subcontracting with trans mex  inc was included in other revenue 
in january  we acquired of trans mex and now fully consolidate its financial results 
other revenue decreased in because the revenue from freight moved by trans mex was reclassified to trucking revenue 
trans mex accounted for million and million of other revenue in and  respectively 
the remaining decline in other revenue in as compared to was a reduction in the revenue received from freight moved by rail 

table of contents other revenue increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in freight moved for our customers on rail and other third party carriers 
in the third quarter of  we hired a new executive to lead our intermodal business 
we believe intermodal business  which involves transporting freight primarily on rail  improves our return on investment since it is less capital intensive than our core trucking business 
we believe this is a growth opportunity for us and are evaluating opportunities to increase our intermodal business 
major customers sales to wal mart  our largest customer  generated almost of our total revenue in our next largest customer generated approximately of our total revenue in services provided to wal mart generated of our revenue in and in revenue and expense comparisons when analyzing our expenses for growth related to volume  we believe using total revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue is a more applicable measure for all costs with the exception of fuel expense 
fuel surcharge revenue is primarily a function of the increases and or decreases in the cost of fuel and not specifically related to our non fuel operational expenses 
in addition  fuel surcharge increased over in as a result of the significant increases in fuel costs  while our trucking and other revenue increased combined 
for these reasons  we analyze our expenses below using revenue excluding fuel surcharge  calculated as follows thousands total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits as of december  thousands salaries  wages and employee benefits of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue total driver compensation increased cents per mile in compared to as a result of the rate increases discussed in the business section above and increases to fringe benefits 
this increase includes a slight reduction in pay per mile resulting from the driver per diem program implemented in september and the consolidation of trans mex 
the per diem program consists of a decrease in the drivers pay per mile offset by a non taxable per diem payment for reimbursement of meals and expenses while on the road 
this program will reduce our salaries  wages and benefits going forward but will increase our income taxes as a portion of the per diem payment is non deductible 
total driver compensation decreased percentage point as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue year over year despite the increase in pay per mile 
this is a function of our revenue per mile increasing more than our driver pay increases and our owner operators driving proportionately more miles in in january  we announced an additional increase to driver pay effective march  the program includes increases up to five cents per mile depending on experience 
the weighted average increase is expected to be approximately two cents per mile including the effect of increased payroll taxes and other benefits that are a function of gross pay 
our non driver salaries  wages and benefits increased approximately million but decreased percentage point as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge 
our average number of non driver employees 
table of contents remained relatively flat  but increases in pay and a million expense for early retirement caused non driver salaries  wages and benefits to increase 
in  our salaries  wages and employee benefits increased correspondingly with the growth of our business as the percentage of revenue excluding fuel surcharge remained relatively flat compared to our deductible amount for workers compensation rose from zero to  per incident in in  this deductible amount for workers compensation rose from  to  per incident and in rose to  we believe that the decrease in the cost of our premiums based on a  deductible will more than offset the cost of claims that occur within the  to  range  which historically have been a small number 
from time to time the industry has experienced shortages of qualified drivers 
if such a shortage were to occur over a prolonged period and increases in driver pay rates were to occur in order to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent we did not obtain corresponding rate increases 
operating supplies and expenses as of december  thousands operating supplies and expenses of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue operating supplies and expenses in increased million compared to approximately million of the increase is due to the consolidation of trans mex 
other variances include a slight increase in maintenance  increased travel  additional legal costs resulting from the sec investigation  and additional expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
the increase in operating supplies and expenses from to was primarily due to increased maintenance costs and deferred legal fees 
we expected the increase in maintenance costs as we extended the life of some of our tractors into the fourth year 
this increase is offset by a reduction in depreciation expense discussed below 
the increase in deferred legal fees is related to a settlement with our insurance provider with which we are amortizing million of legal fees on a straight line basis over a month period from july to december the legal settlement is discussed in the insurance and claims section below 
fuel expense as of december  thousands fuel expense of total revenue company fuel cost per gallon fuel costs in increased million or compared to the majority of the increase is the result of our average fuel cost per gallon increasing over year over year 
approximately of the increase is due to the additional miles associated with our revenue increase and the remaining increase is due to a reduction in fuel efficiency resulting from a larger portion of our engines conforming to the new engines mandated by the us environmental protection agency that became effective october   and the higher driving speeds adopted in july of in compared to  fuel expense increased of which was the result of an increase in our cost per gallon  was due to the increase in number of miles driven  and the remaining increase was primarily caused by an increase in fuel required for our increased number of refrigerated trailers 

table of contents increases in fuel costs  to the extent not offset by rate increases or fuel surcharges  would have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we believe that the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel efficient fleet and to implement fuel surcharges when such an option is necessary and available 
we do not use derivative type hedging products  but periodically evaluate their possible use 
to measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program  we subtract fuel surcharge revenue received for company miles driven as opposed to miles driven by our owner operators who pay for their own fuel from our fuel expense 
the result is evaluated as a percent of revenue less fuel surcharge revenue 
these measures are shown below as of december  thousands total fuel surcharge revenue less fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to owner operators company fuel surcharge revenue total fuel expense less company fuel surcharge revenue net fuel expense of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue our net fuel expense has remained relatively flat as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge for the past three years 
this indicates that our fuel surcharge program has effectively offset the impact of rising diesel fuel costs  and our net fuel expense increases are the result of volume 
purchased transportation as of december  thousands total purchased transportation of total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to owner operators purchased transportation excluding fuel surcharge reimbursement of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue purchased transportation increased million in compared to of which million was the increase in fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to our owner operators 
excluding fuel surcharge  purchased transportation has increased percentage point year over year as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
in and prior  the cost of using trans mex was included in purchased transportation 
after completing the acquisition of trans mex in january  we began consolidating their financial statements  and their costs now are shown on each individual line item on the consolidated statement of earnings 
therefore  the purchased transportation line has been reduced by these trans mex costs 
this accounts for approximately a one percentage point reduction 
this reduction was offset by an increase in owner operator costs 
our owner operators drove approximately more miles for us in in addition  they have received rate per mile increases  hours of service rate increases  and other incentive pay in order for us to attract and retain owner operators 
we are also offering a pay increase of two cents per mile for owner operators in in conjunction with our driver pay increase discussed above 
purchased transportation increased in compared to as our owner operator fleet increased from  at december  to  at december  and our use of rail increased 

table of contents insurance and claims as of december  thousands insurance and claims of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue insurance and claims in was of revenue excluding fuel surcharge  compared to in and in the reduction in was due to a reduction in development on prior year claims 
the growth in insurance and claims between and was reflective of the growth in the business as the cost as a percent of revenue excluding fuel surcharge remained relatively flat 
as discussed under critical accounting policies  we are self insured for some portion of our liability  property damage and cargo damage risk 
we buy insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
beginning in  the deductible amount for general liability rose from  to  per incident 
in december  we entered into an agreement with insurance carriers to provide transportation liability insurance with an aggregate limit of million for the new policy increases the self insured portion to million per incident 
the primary portion of the coverage million in excess of the self insured portion is extended through based upon our historical loss experience  we expect insurance and claims expense to be between and of operating revenue for this expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
as we discussed in the notes to our financial statements  we entered into a settlement agreement with an insurance company in pursuant to this settlement  the insurance company agreed to provide certain insurance coverage  at no cost to the company  through december  in exchange for our releasing all claims that were the subject of the litigation 
we recognized this settlement amount as a reduction of insurance expense as the insurance coverage was provided during the period from july  through december  in addition  we deferred the million of legal expenses  which were paid pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement based upon our estimate of the value of the insurance provided of between million and million 
these legal expenses were contingent upon our ability to receive the insurance coverage outlined in the settlement due to the liquidation  rehabilitation  bankruptcy or other similar insolvency of the insurers and  therefore  were amortized on a straight line basis over the thirty month period from july  through december  rental expense  depreciation and amortization as of december  thousands rental expense of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue depreciation and amortization of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue total rental  depreciation and amortization expense of total revenue of revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
table of contents rental expense and depreciation expense are primarily driven by our fleet of tractors and trailers shown below as of december  tractors company owned leased total company tractors owner operator tractors total tractors average tractors available for dispatch trailers total tractors owned and leased include tractors being prepared for service and tractors waiting to be returned under lease or resold at the end of our replacement program 
average tractors is calculated on a monthly basis and represents tractors available for dispatch 
over the past three years  we have been purchasing more tractors as a percent of total tractors rather than leasing 
this has caused our rental expense to decrease and our depreciation expense to increase 
as a percentage of revenue excluding fuel surcharge  total rental  depreciation and amortization expense was flat from to rental expense decreased in as we reduced the number of tractors on lease from  as of december  to  as december  this reduction in tractor lease cost was partially offset by an increase in short term trailer rent expense and the loss on sale of leased tractors explained below 
in  our rental expense decreased compared to due to a reduction in the number of tractors on lease 
in  depreciation and amortization expense increased as the number of tractors owned increased from  as of december  to  at december  as discussed in the overview above  the assets associated with our autohaul business were accounted for as assets held for sale in the fourth quarter of and were not depreciated in the fourth quarter 
depreciation expense in the fourth quarter did include an impairment charge of million to adjust all assets held for sale to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the decrease in depreciation expense in as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the extension of the life of some of our tractors into the fourth year 
prior to  we primarily operated the tractors over a three year life 
we changed the operating cycle of our tractors from three to four years in based on the evaluation of the new engines mandated by the us environmental protection agency that became effective october  we determined the new tractors are more costly and less fuel efficient 
therefore  to make them more economical  we increased maintenance to extend their useful lives 
in the third quarter of  we further amended our replacement cycle by extending it to five years 
to implement these changes  the remaining net book value at the time of the change is being depreciated on a straight line basis over the remaining adjusted economic life to the revised residual value 
the benefit expense of changing the tractor s lives that were owned as of october  is shown below for the year ending december  thousands except share data earnings before income taxes net earnings diluted earnings per share 
table of contents when it is economically advantageous to do so  we will purchase and then resell tractors that we currently lease by exercising the purchase option contained in the lease 
gains on these activities are recorded as a reduction of rental expense 
we also generate gains from the sale of tractors we own 
these gains are recorded as a reduction of depreciation expense 
the gains losses are summarized below 
thousands gain loss on sale of leased equipment gain on sale of owned equipment other expenses interest expense our largest pre tax non operating expense is interest 
our debt balance combining the operating line of credit  accounts receivable securitization  capital leases  senior notes and other debt was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
thousands interest expense increase decrease in derivative agreements interest expense  net of derivative agreements our interest expense  net of the impact of the derivative agreements  increased in our average debt balance increased during the year as we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total cost of million  paid million in cash for part of the purchase price of trans mex  and expended million on net capital expenditures compared to million in in addition  in june  we completed our private placement of senior notes  which have a weighted average interest rate of 
although this fixed rate is currently higher than our variable rate debt  these senior notes provide us with strategic capital with five and seven year maturities 
interest expense  net of the impact of the derivative agreements  also increased in this is a result of the senior notes discussed above partially offset by lower interest rates and a shift in borrowings from more costly debt related to capital leases  entered into under ms carriers  to less costly swift debt 
other income expense in january  we sold a property for million  net of expenses  and recognized a gain of million 
in june  we adjusted the carrying value of four properties and a note receivable to our current estimate of the net realizable value and recognized a loss of million 
these transactions are included within other income expense on the consolidated statement of earnings 
also included in this line item are the equity earnings of transplace 
the equity earnings of trans mex  a company we acquired of in january  are included in other income expense in and in  an additional nonrecurring charge of million was recorded which represents our portion of the loss associated with the discontinuance of a business made within transplace 
income taxes our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
in  we benefited from a lower than originally anticipated state tax rate resulting from the completion and filing of our state tax returns  including the adjustment of our deferred taxes to the revised rate 
this one time benefit was offset by the effect of the company s recently implemented driver per diem program  a portion of which is non deductible 
we anticipate that our tax rate will increase in to approximately due to the full year impact of the per diem program 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow our cash flow sources and uses by operating  investing and financing activities are shown below thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is driven by a million increase in net earnings before depreciation and amortization charges and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in our net earnings in was the primary driver of our increase in cash provided by operating activities 
our cash used in investing activities is mainly driven by our capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds 
our capital expenditures  net of cash sales proceeds were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  we expended million for a portion of the trans mex purchase in  million for the purchase of merit distribution  inc in  and we made loans to investment entities of million in regarding our financing activities  in we repurchased million of treasury stock  increased our borrowings on our receivable securitization by million and increased our borrowings on our revolving line of credit by a net million 
we also repaid million of other long term debt and capital leases and received million in stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds 
in we issued million of senior notes and repaid million of debt including capital leases and securitization 
also  we repurchased million of our common stock and received million in proceeds from our employee stock option and stock purchase plans in in we repurchased million of our common stock and received million in stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds 
working capital as of december  and we had working capital deficits of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  the accounts receivable securitization is reflected as a current liability because the committed term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
the funds received under the accounts receivable securitization are generally used for capital expenditures or repurchases of our common stock 
therefore  our working capital will be reduced by the amount of the proceeds received under the accounts receivable securitization but the increase in fixed assets or treasury stock is not included in working capital 
credit facilities in june  we extended and expanded our existing million revolving line of credit  which was scheduled to mature in november the revised facility is a million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks and has a five year term 
interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon one of two options  which we select at the time of borrowing the bank s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins ranging from to basis points  as defined in the credit agreement currently basis points 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a commitment fee ranging from to basis points currently basis points 
the credit agreement requires us to meet certain covenants with respect to leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and tangible net worth 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain unencumbered assets of not less than of indebtedness as defined 
as of december  we are in compliance with these debt covenants 
we have million of 
table of contents borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding on our line of credit leaving million available as of december  we expect to issue an additional million of letters of credit in as a result of the increase in our self insured portion of our general liability policy 
in the fourth quarter of we expanded our accounts receivable securitization by million to allow us to receive up to million of proceeds  subject to eligible trade accounts receivable 
under the amended agreement  the committed term was extended to december  as of december   we had received sales proceeds of million 
under the terms of our agreement  of our trade receivables collateralize the securitization arrangement as of december  capital commitments and expenditures as of december   we had commitments outstanding to acquire replacement and additional revenue equipment 
we have the option to cancel such commitments upon days notice 
we anticipate spending approximately million for revenue equipment capital expenditures in we believe we will be able to support these purchases with cash flows from operating activities  lease financings and debt 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of non revenue equipment capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for facilities and equipment 
we anticipate that we will expend approximately million in for various facilities upgrades and acquisition and development of terminal facilities 
factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures 
we believe we will be able to finance needs for working capital  facilities improvements and expansion  as well as anticipated fleet growth  with cash flows from operations  borrowings available under the line of credit  accounts receivable securitization and with long term debt and lease financing believed to be available to finance revenue equipment purchases 
over the long term  we will continue to have significant capital requirements  which may require us to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of debt financing or equity capital will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and other factors over which we have little or no control 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in the commitments note to the financial statements  the company guarantees certain residual values under its operating lease agreements for revenue equipment 
upon termination of these operating leases  the company would be responsible for the excess of the guarantee amount above the fair market value  if any 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company would be required to make under these guarantees is million 
the company utilizes operating leases as an additional financing source 

table of contents contractual obligations the tables below summarize our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations fair value of interest rate swaps total contractual obligations operating leases include an interest element within the commitment amount as opposed to the long term debt and capital lease obligations amounts  which do not include an interest element 
deferred taxes and long term portion of claims accruals are excluded from other long term obligations in the table above 
table excludes purchase commitments for revenue equipment which are cancelable 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation would cause interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs to increase and would adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season 
our operating expenses also tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time

forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements 
statements in this annual report  including the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  describe factors  among others  that could contribute to or cause such differences 
additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements are set forth in business and market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in this annual report 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to successfully provide truckload carrier services to meet dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  the factors discussed below 
general economic and business factors our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  interest rates  fuel taxes  tolls  license and registration fees and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates 
the results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as retail  manufacturing and paper products in which there is a concentration of customers 
in addition  the results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
qualified drivers periodically  the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
if we are unable to continue to attract drivers or contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
cost of fuel significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices are major issues for the transportation industry 
increases in fuel costs  to the extent not offset by rate per mile increases or fuel surcharges  have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we believe that the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel efficient fleet and to implement fuel surcharges when such an option is necessary and available 
however  there can be no assurance that such fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely 
we do not use derivative type hedging instruments  but periodically evaluate their possible use 
competition the trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with railroads 
historically  competition has created downward 
table of contents pressure on the truckload industry s pricing structure 
some trucking companies with which we compete have greater financial resources and carry a larger volume of freight 
capital requirements the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
we depend on cash from operations  operating leases and debt financing for funds to expand the size of our fleet and maintain modern revenue equipment 
if we were unable in the future to enter into acceptable financing arrangements  it would limit our growth 
acquisitions our growth has been dependent  in part  upon the acquisition of trucking companies throughout the united states 
to date  we have been successful in identifying trucking companies to acquire and in integrating such companies operations into our operations 
we may face competition from transportation companies or other third parties for acquisition opportunities that become available 
there can be no assurance that we will identify acquisition candidates that will result in successful combinations in the future 
any future acquisitions by us may result in the incurrence of additional debt  which could adversely affect our profitability  or could involve the potentially dilutive issuance of additional equity securities 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilation of the acquired company s operations particularly in the period immediately following the consummation of such transactions  the diversion of the attention of management from other business  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
dependence on key personnel many of our executive officers are key to the management of our business and operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain these officers and other capable managers 
although we believe we could replace key personnel given adequate prior notice  the unexpected departure of key executive officers could cause substantial disruption to our business and operations 
in addition  we may not be able to retain and recruit talented personnel without incurring substantial costs 
regulation we are regulated by the united states department of transportation 
this regulatory authority exercises broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and certain mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
we may also become subject to new or more comprehensive or restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions and ergonomics 
the increased cost of complying with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in  a compliance review by the arizona division of the federal motor carrier safety division fmsca resulted in a proposed rating status for swift of conditional 
there are three possible ratings assigned by fmsca satisfactory  conditional and unsatisfactory 
the proposed drop in our rating status relates to the accuracy of the documentation of driving logs maintained by our drivers and owner operators 
we have appealed this rating and petitioned fmsca for a review of our rating status 
until this review is complete  our conditional rating is stayed and our rating remains satisfactory 
if fmsca ultimately determines our safety rating to be conditional it could result in certain material adverse consequences to our business and operations 
although a conditional rating will not result in the loss of our authority to transport hazardous materials  certain industry standard provisions in our contracts with our customers could allow the customer to reduce or terminate its relationship with us 
if a significant customer or large number of smaller customers  or combination thereof  reduce or terminate their relationship with us  it would have a material adverse affect on our business 
in addition  there is a possibility that a drop to conditional status could affect our ability to self insure for personal injury and property damage relating to the transportation of freight  which could cause our insurance costs to increase 

table of contents in addition  our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal and handling of hazardous materials  discharge of storm water and underground fuel storage tanks 
if we should be involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in january  the department of transportation adopted new regulations concerning the maximum number of hours of service that commercial truck drivers may operate 
the revised regulations increased the maximum daily drive time from to hours  but no longer allow for breaks in the on on duty period 
these changes could reduce the time that a driver is available to drive as a result of the calculation of the on duty period and productivity losses could occur with respect to our business 
if we are unsuccessful in working with our shippers to adjust for the impact of these new regulations  it could have a negative impact on our financial results 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a decision vacating the new hos rules 
under the court s rules  fmcsa had days to seek a rehearing 
on september   congress extended the new hos rules for one year 
fmcsa officials have announced that they will continue enforcing the new hos rules during this period 
used equipment market we rely on the sale of used equipment to offset the cost of purchasing new equipment 
from to  used tractor values deteriorated significantly 
in  used tractor prices began rising 
should this trend reverse and prices deteriorate  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
claims exposure  insurance we currently self insure for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  workers compensation  and property damage  and maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above our limits on self insurance 
to the extent we were to experience an increase in the number of claims for which we are self insured  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  significant increases in insurance costs  to the extent not offset by freight rate increases  would reduce our profitability 
dependence on key customers a significant portion of our revenue is generated from key customers 
during  the company s top  and customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
our largest customer  wal mart accounted for of our revenues in we do not have long term contractual relationships with many of our key customers  and there can be no assurance that our relationships with our key customers will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have interest rate exposure arising from borrowings under the line of credit million  variable rate capital lease obligations million and the accounts receivable securitization million  all of which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of variable rate debt  fixed rate lease financing and million notional amount of interest rate swaps weighted average rate of 
there are no leverage options or prepayment features for the interest rate swaps 
the fair value of our long term debt approximates carrying values 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense by million
