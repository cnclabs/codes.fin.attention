quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is mitigated through maintenance of local production facilities in the markets served  invoicing of customers in the same currency as the source of the products and use of foreign currency denominated debt in denmark 
the company has used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risks 
the forward contracts are short term in duration  generally one year or less 
the major currency exposure hedged by the company is the canadian dollar 
the contract amounts  carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts were not significant at january   and the changeover from national currencies to the euro began on january  and it has not materially affected the company s foreign currency exchange risk profile  although some customers may require the company to invoice or pay in euros rather than the functional currency of the manufacturing entity 
the company has attempted to mitigate its interest rate risk by maintaining a balance of fixed rate long term debt and floating rate debt 
commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities  such as ferrous alloys eg  steel which the company uses in the production of piping systems 
the company attempts to mitigate such risks by obtaining price commitments from its commodity suppliers and  when it appears appropriate  purchasing quantities in advance of likely price increases
