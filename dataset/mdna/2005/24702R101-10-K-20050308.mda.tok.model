item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes 
dell s overall profitability may not meet expectations if its product  customer  and geographic mix is substantially different than anticipated 
the profit margins realized by dell vary among its products  customers  and geographies 
consequently  if dell s mix of any of these is substantially different from what it anticipates in any particular period  dell s profitability could be less than expected 
dell s net revenue may not meet expectations if it is unable to accurately predict the effect of seasonality on its business 
dell experiences seasonal trends in the sale of its products and services 
for example  during dell s third fiscal quarter  sales to government customers particularly the us federal government are typically stronger than in other quarters  while sales in europe are often weaker than in other quarters 
consumer sales are typically strongest during dell s fourth fiscal quarter 
as dell increases its sales in the highly seasonal consumer sector  this seasonal effect may increase 
if dell is not able to accurately anticipate seasonal trends  dell s net revenue and profitability could be less than expected 
infrastructure failures could have a material adverse effect on dell s business 
dell is highly dependent on its infrastructure in order to achieve its business objectives 
if dell experiences a problem that impairs its infrastructure  such as a computer virus  intentional disruption of it systems by a third party  manufacturing failure  or telephone system failure  the resulting disruptions could impede dell s ability to book or process orders  manufacture  and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on its business in the ordinary course 
any such events could cause dell to lose significant customers or revenue and could require dell to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 
further  because dell s sales are not generally linear during any particular quarterly period  the potential adverse effect resulting from any such events or any other disruption to dell s business could be accentuated if it occurs during a disproportionately heavy demand or shipping cycle during any quarterly period 
a failure on the part of dell to effectively manage a product transition will directly affect the demand for dell s products and the profitability of dell s operations 
the technology industry is characterized by continuing improvements in technology  which result in the frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  and continual improvement in product performance 
table of contents characteristics 
product transitions present some of the greatest execution challenges and risks for any technology company 
accordingly  if dell is unable to effectively manage a product transition  its business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
in addition  continuing technological advancement  which is a significant driver of customer demand  is largely beyond dell s control 
disruptions in component availability could unfavorably affect dell s performance 
dell s direct business model gives it the ability to operate with reduced levels of component and finished goods inventories 
dell s financial success in recent periods has been due in part to its supply chain management practices  including its ability to achieve rapid inventory turns 
however  because dell maintains only minimal levels of component inventory  dell s financial performance  as well as its ability to satisfy customer needs  could be negatively affected if it suffers a disruption in component availability 
dell s reliance on suppliers creates risks and uncertainties 
dell s manufacturing process requires a high volume of quality components that are procured from third party suppliers 
reliance on suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of defective parts which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of dell s products  a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules which can adversely affect dell s manufacturing efficiencies  and increases in component costs which can adversely affect dell s profitability 
dell could experience manufacturing interruptions  delays  or inefficiencies if it is unable to timely and reliably procure components from certain single sourced suppliers 
dell maintains several single source supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance  quality  support  delivery  capacity  or price considerations 
if the supply of a critical single source material or component were delayed or curtailed  dell s ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected 
even where alternative sources of supply are available  qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales  which could adversely affect operating results 
dell s results may be affected if it does not effectively hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
dell utilizes derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about risk on financial instruments  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 
further  dell may experience a decrease in revenue from its international operations if it is does not effectively hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations 
dell s continued business success may be largely dependent on its ability to obtain licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms 
if dell or its suppliers are unable to obtain desirable technology licenses  dell could be prohibited from marketing products  could be forced to market products without desirable features  or could incur substantial costs to redesign its products  defend legal actions  or pay damages 
dell s failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue or profitability 
dell cannot provide any assurance that it will succeed in attracting and retaining enough qualified personnel to support its anticipated rapid international growth and its increasingly complex product and service offerings 
dell relies in part on the granting of equity awards to attract and retain qualified personnel 
new accounting regulations regarding the expensing of stock options may affect both dell s ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel and increase dell s compensation costs 

table of contents loss of government contracts could have a material adverse effect on dell s business 
government contracts are subject to future funding that may affect the extension or termination of programs  and are subject to the right of the government to terminate for convenience or non appropriation 
in addition  if dell violates legal or regulatory requirements  the government could suspend or disbar dell as a contractor 
dell s suspension or disbarment as a government contractor would negatively affect dell s net revenue and profitability 
dell cannot provide any assurance that current environmental laws  or any laws enacted in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on dell 
dell s operations are subject to environmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which dell conducts business 
some of dell s manufacturing operations use substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions 
in addition  dell must comply with new regulations restricting the company s ability to include lead and certain other substances in its products 
if dell does not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use and sale of such substances  dell could be subject to liability 
dell could also face substantial costs and liabilities in connection with product take back legislation 
beginning in august  dell will be subject to the european union waste electrical and electronic equipment directive as enacted by individual european union countries weee legislation  which makes producers of electrical goods  including computers and printers  responsible for collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of recovered products 
dell does not expect that the impact of the weee legislation and other similar legislation adopted in japan and california will have a material adverse effect on dell 
if dfs is unable to provide financing to dell s customers  dell would be forced to use alternative sources for financing for its customers or self finance these activities and  as a result  could experience a decline in its cash flow from operations 
should dfs experience an interruption in operations  dell would likely have to use alternative sources for financing arrangements with its customers 
dell is currently dependent upon dfs  a joint venture with cit  to provide financing for a significant number of customers who elect to finance dell products  and dfs is dependent in part upon cit to access the capital markets to provide funding for these transactions 
if cit is unable to access the capital markets  dfs may not be able to fully fund customer financing arrangements 
upon any such interruption in services  dell would be forced to use alternative sources for financing for its customers  or self finance these activities 
although dell has sufficient alternative sources for financing these activities  dell could nonetheless experience a decline in its cash flow from operations if it is unable to do so in a timely manner 
armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  or public health issues could have a material adverse effect on dell s business 
armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  or public health issues  whether in the us or abroad  could cause damage or disruption to dell  its suppliers or customers  or could create political or economic instability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on dell s business 
although it is impossible to predict the consequences of any such events  such events could result in a decrease in demand for dell s products  could make it difficult or impossible for dell to deliver products or for its suppliers to deliver components  and could create delay and inefficiencies in dell s supply chain
