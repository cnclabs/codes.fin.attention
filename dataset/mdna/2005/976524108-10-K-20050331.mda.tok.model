this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions are made by management to assess the overall likelihood that an accounting estimate or assumption may require adjustment 
management assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past  and future estimates or assumptions are likely to be calculated on the same basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a key consideration in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts has been  and will continue to be  our customer s payment history and aging of its accounts receivable balance 
for example  based upon our receivable balances  for every additional increase needed in our reserve  we will have to increas e our allowance by approximately  and record a similar charge to operations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance 
increase s in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if the ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
our deferred tax asset at december   aggregates approximately  we must continue to be profitable in order to be able to utilize this asset in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment not less than annually and whenever event s or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any such asset may be impaired 
the company s management evaluates the recoverability of such assets by estimating future cash flows 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition  is less than the carrying amount of the assets  management will recognize an impairment loss to the extent of the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the discounted cash flow 
sfas no 
requires that the company perform an assessment of whethe r there is an indication that goodwill is impaired on an annual basis unless events or circumstances warrant a more frequent assessment 
the impairment assessment involves  among other things  an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit based on the discounted cash flow methodology 
significant assumptions used in our analysis include annual revenue growth rate from to and a discount rate of approximately 
if the assessment indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the goodwill would be subject to an impairment loss adjustment 
if the impairment review of goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets differ significantly from actual results  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition
