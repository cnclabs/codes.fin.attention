item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preliminary note regarding forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections 
factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and earlier in this report under business factors that could affect future results beginning on page the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview we design  develop  market and service high performance computer systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
these systems provide capability and capacity far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific and engineering computing problems for government  industry and academia 
we are dedicated solely to the high performance computing market 
we have concentrated our product roadmap on building purpose built  balanced systems combining highly capable processors whether developed by ourselves or others with rapid interconnect and communications capabilities throughout the entire computing system  not solely processor to processor 
we believe we are in the best position to meet the high performance computer market s demanding needs by providing superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages over low bandwidth and cluster systems when sustained performance on challenging applications and workloads and total cost of ownership are taken into account 
we also derive revenue from providing maintenance and support services to the worldwide installed base of cray computers and professional services that leverage our industry technical knowledge 
our revenue  net income or loss and cash balances are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and within a quarter due to the high average sales prices and limited number of sales of our larger products  the timing of purchase orders and product deliveries  our general policy of not recognizing product revenue for our larger systems until customer acceptance and other contractual provisions have been fulfilled  and the uncertain timing of payments for product sales  maintenance services  government research and development funding  and inventory 

table of contents in we completed hardware development of and began selling our cray x system 
we were then also selling other hardware products we obtained with the acquisition of the cray research assets from sgi 
in mid we began development of the red storm project for sandia national laboratories and began work on the cascade project under a darpa grant 
in we were principally selling cray x systems and continuing work on the red storm and cascade projects 
in we were in transition from a single product  the cray x system  to three new products the cray xe system  an enhancement to the cray x system that significantly increases processor speed and capability  the cray xt system  developed through the red storm project  and the cray xd system  a product in development we acquired with the april acquisition of octigabay systems corporation 
initial customer shipments for each of these products occurred in late  with full production ramp planned for see business history and product offerings  projects and services in item above 
we experienced net losses in each full year of our development stage operations prior to we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in for  we had net income of million and for we had net income of million including an income benefit of million from the reversal of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and for we had a net loss of million including an expense for acquired in process research and development of million and an income tax expense of million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
our challenges to achieving a profitable include introduction and ramp up of our three new products  including completion of system software development  obtaining sufficient revenue and margins in a highly competitive market  and maintaining controls on expense levels while not adversely impacting future growth 
our fiscal year is the calendar year  and references to a particular year are to the year ended december of that year 
factors that should be considered in evaluating our business  operations and prospects and that could affect our future results  financial condition and market prices of our securities are set forth above under business factors that could affect future results in item above 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to estimates of deferred tax realizability  valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market  the percentage complete and estimated gross profit on the red storm and cascade contracts  and impairment of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  title and risk of loss of products has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is 
table of contents reasonable assured 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue and for multiple element arrangements product 
we recognize revenue based upon product line  as follows cray x xe and xt product line we generally recognize revenue from product sales upon customer acceptance and when there are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance 
a customer signed notice of acceptance or similar document is required from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
xd product line the company generally recognizes revenue from product sales of cray xd systems upon shipment to or delivery to the customer  depending upon contract terms 
if there is a contractual requirement for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon receipt of the notice of acceptance and when there are no unfulfilled company obligations 
revenue from contracts that require us to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex information technology systems to a customer s specifications  and to provide services related to the performance of such contracts  is recognized using the percentage of completion method for long term development projects 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs 
total estimated costs are based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and the estimated cost of purchased components at future dates 
estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter  which would impact revenue and margins on a cumulative basis 
revenue from contracts structured as operating leases is recorded as earned over the lease terms 
services service revenue for the maintenance of computers is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
funds from maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
high performance computing service revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  maintenance and other services and or software 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered element is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of such item the fair value of the elements  or for residual method calculations the undelivered element  is established  the functionality of the delivered elements are not dependent on the undelivered elements  and delivery of the delivered element represents the culmination of the earnings process 
if all of the criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element 
inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness of various inventory components 
when it is determined that previously inventoried components do not function as intended in a fully operational system  the costs associated with these components are expensed 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
as a result  it is possible that older products we have developed may become obsolete or we may sell these products below cost 
when we determine that we will likely not recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
in the third quarter of  we wrote down our cray x system inventory by million and our cray xd system inventory by million 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our 
table of contents inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
goodwill approximately of our assets as of december   consisted of goodwill resulting from our acquisitions of the cray research business unit from sgi in and our acquisition of octigabay systems corporation in april we no longer amortize goodwill associated with the acquisitions  but we are required to conduct ongoing analyses of the recorded amount of goodwill in comparison to its estimated fair value 
we performed annual impairment tests effective january  and january  and determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired 
these analyses and ongoing analyses of whether the fair value of recorded goodwill is impaired will involve a substantial amount of judgment 
future charges related to goodwill could be material depending on future developments and changes in technology and our business 
in we decreased goodwill by million due to the reversal of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
see note income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
the provision for or benefit from income taxes represents taxes payable or receivable for the current period plus the net change in deferred tax and valuation allowance amounts during the period 
in we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we determined that  based on our historical operating performance and reasonably expected future performance  we would be able to utilize most of our net deferred tax asset 
in we reestablished the valuation allowance and recorded an income tax expense of million 
based on the results of our operations in and based on our revised projections  we now believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized through future operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts our management must make estimates of allowances for potential future uncollectible amounts related to current period revenues of our products and services 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a management estimate that considers actual facts and circumstances of individual customers and other debtors  such as financial condition and historical payment trends 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance utilizing a combination of specific identification of potentially problematic accounts and identification of accounts that have exceeded payment terms 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
red storm loss reserves as noted in our revenue recognition policy  revenue from our red storm development project is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs 
during  we adjusted our estimate of total estimated costs and now expect to incur a loss on this contract 
as of december   our estimated cumulative loss is million  which is included within accrued liabilities in the december  balance sheet 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in november the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion set forth in arb no 
this statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
that cost should be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including employee share options  performance based awards and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas no 
r is effective for us as of july  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenue product revenue we recorded product revenue of million in  million in and million in product revenue represented of total revenue for  compared to in and in the decline in product revenue in was primarily due to limited cray x system sales and lower than planned revenue on the red storm contract 
in we recognized approximately million of revenue for the red storm and cascade development projects with the remaining product revenue primarily relating to cray x system sales 
we were unable to recognize revenue on deliveries of cray xe and cray xt systems made late in the fourth quarter 
the growth in product revenue in was principally due to the availability of the cray x system for the entire year as well as contributions from the red storm and cascade projects  in we recognized approximately million of revenue for the red storm and cascade projects  with the remaining primarily due to cray x system sales 
product revenue in related principally to products we no longer market with approximately million due to early cray x system sales and approximately million from the red storm and cascade projects 
we expect product revenue to grow in in both absolute amounts and as a percentage contribution to total revenue 
this revenue growth depends on sales of our three new products cray xe  cray xt and cray xd systems with expected total revenue from our red storm and cascade projects of approximately to million 
we expect our product revenue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the product ramp up for each of our products in the first part of as well as the uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition for several large transactions 
service revenue we recorded service revenue of million  including revenue from maintenance services of million in  compared to service revenue of million in and million in service revenue represented of total revenue for  for and in the increase in percentage contribution to total revenue  despite the decline in the amount of service revenue  is due to the steeper decline in product revenue 
the decline in percentage contribution between and is due to the 
table of contents significant increase in product revenue in from sales of the cray x system and the contributions from the red storm and cascade projects  as well as the decline in maintenance revenue 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods 
maintenance service revenue has declined on an annual basis as older systems are withdrawn from service 
we expect maintenance service revenue to continue to decline slightly over the next year as our older systems continue to be withdrawn from service and then to stabilize as our new systems are placed in service 
in addition  we expect that our newer products will require less hardware maintenance than our historic vector systems  which will affect adversely the rate of service revenue growth 
operating expenses cost of product revenue 
we recorded cost of product revenue of million in  million in and million in our cost of product represented of product revenue in  compared to in and in revenue for  and includes   and million  respectively  from the sale of obsolete inventory recorded at a zero cost basis 
cost of product revenue in was adversely affected by inventory write downs of million  a million reserve for estimated additional costs to be incurred in completing the red storm project  a million adjustment for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead relating to lower than planned production of cray x systems and by the product mix  with proportionately less revenue from the limited sales of cray x systems 
we presently estimate that we will recognize a cumulative loss of approximately million on the red storm contract 
in  we recorded negative margin on the red storm contract  and we expect to record zero margin on future red storm revenue 
the negative red storm margin  low margin contribution from the cascade project  increasing margin pressure on the cray x systems  and low initial margin contribution from the cray xd system  which is marketed in the more competitive massively parallel processor market and had higher start up manufacturing costs  together with the adjustments described in the preceding paragraph  eliminated overall product margins in the minimal margin contribution from the red storm and cascade projects  ramp up costs associated with each of our new products  and the competitive market pressure on our products will impact margins adversely 
cost of service revenue 
we recorded cost of service revenue of million in  million in and million in our cost of service revenue represented of service revenue for  compared to in and in in our cost of service revenue was favorably impacted by high margin professional service contracts  service cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of and the second half of  and the completed amortization of legacy spare parts inventory by march  in and cost of service revenue was favorably impacted by a reduction in cray t warranty reserves of million and million  respectively 
as we continue to experience declines in maintenance revenue before new shipments into the installed base offset retirements  we may continue to reduce maintenance service personnel and experience associated severance expenses 
we expect maintenance costs for the next several quarters to approximate of revenue 
research and development research and development expenses in reflect our costs associated with the development of the cray xe  cray xt  cray xd systems and successor projects  including related software development  and the cray mta to a lesser extent 
research and development expenses in and reflect our costs associated with the development of the cray x system and in its enhancements and successors  and to a lesser extent  the cray mta in both periods  including related software development 
research and development expenses also include personnel expenses  allocated overhead and operating expenses  software  materials and engineering expenses  including payments to third parties 
gross research and development expenses in the table below reflect all research and development expenditures  including expenses related to our research and development activities on the red storm and cascade projects 
the government funding reflects reimbursement by the government for research and development and services  including development 
table of contents of the cray x xe systems  enhancements and successors to the cray x xe system and other products  and our research and development personnel dedicated to the red storm and cascade projects 
the red storm and cascade research and development costs are reflected on our financial statements as cost of product revenue and the related reimbursements are recorded on our financial statements as product revenue 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands gross research and development government funding net research and development net research and development expenditures represented  and  of revenue in  and  respectively  even though we have received increased government funding each year 
the higher percentage is due to lower revenue earned in and to increases in research and development expenses for most of our products and projects including an increase of approximately million to million per quarter due to the octigabay acquisition at the beginning of the second quarter  other than for our red storm project 
we expect that gross and net research and development expenses will decline in  given the restructuring actions and completion of the red storm project coupled with an increase in government funding 
these reductions will be offset in part by increased non recurring engineering and other expenses related to using texas instruments as our foundry for certain of our future products 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of revenue  marketing and sales expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in these expenses in was primarily due to the write off of prepaid computer access services and additional benchmarking  application and sales personnel as well as to the introduction of our three new products 
we also experienced an unfavorable currency exchange rate in our overseas personnel expenses in compared to we expect marketing and sales expenses to decline in due to cost reductions relative to the restructuring offset in part by the introduction of cray xe  cray xt and cray xd systems and increased sales commissions due to higher sales activities 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were  and of revenue for  and  respectively 
the increase in these expenses in was due primarily to consulting costs related to sarbanes oxley act of compliance and additional expenses as a result of our acquisition of octiga bay  including additional depreciation  insurance and utilities 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decline in due to the restructuring and lesser expenditures on outside services for sarbanes oxley compliance  offset in part by staff increases in our finance department 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in  million in and million in the costs primarily represented severance expenses related to the termination of employees in the united states and an additional employees throughout the rest of the world in the second half of of the amount  million represented severance expenses related to the termination of employees  primarily associated with our service activities in europe and japan  and the remaining  related to expensing certain technology that we no longer use 
the charge represented severance expenses related to the termination of employees 

table of contents acquisition related compensation expense acquisition related compensation expense relates to deferred compensation resulting from retention agreements with key octigabay personnel and existing stock options held by octigabay employees which we assumed in the acquisition 
the retention agreements expire in november and the assumed stock options vest over the next three to four years 
in december we terminated the retention agreements of three key employees and accelerated the recognition of the related deferred compensation accordingly 
total acquisition related compensation expense recognized during was million 
subject to currency fluctuations  we expect to incur a quarterly amortization expense of approximately  per quarter through december and approximately  per quarter thereafter through april in process research and development charge as part of the acquisition of octigabay  we incurred an expense associated with acquired in process research and development of million in the second quarter of other income expense  net other expense was  in  compared to other income of million in and million in other expense in primarily consisted of foreign currency losses and an impairment charge related to one of our investments 
other income in primarily consisted of foreign currency gains  based on net payables receivables situations with our foreign subsidiaries  and other income in primarily consisted of a negotiated settlement of an accrued cancellation charge on a purchase commitment 
interest income expense  net interest income was  in   in and  in interest income in was related primarily to our cash and short term investments balances  which  on average  were consistent with the balances during the interest income reflects our increased average cash position in over following our public offering in february in which we raised million 
interest expense was  in   in and million for the interest expense for reflects approximately one month of interest on our convertible notes  one month of amortization of the related capitalized issuance costs and interest on our capital leases 
the interest expense for reflects interest on our term loan for the first four months of the year and interest on our capital leases 
interest expense for was largely due to a non cash charge of million associated with the convertible debenture financing completed in november and  of interest paid on our term loan  line of credit and capital leases 
taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets primarily consisting of accumulated net operating losses and acquisition related deferred tax assets 
under the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  management concluded that it was unlikely that the future benefits of these deferred tax assets would be realized 
in we recorded an income tax benefit of million as part of the reversal of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
in we had an income tax provision of million  primarily relating to income taxes in foreign countries and certain states 
there has been no provision for us federal income taxes for any period 
we have income taxes currently payable due to our operations in certain foreign countries  particularly in canada  and in certain states where taxes are based upon capital and other non income basis 
as of december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that begin to expire in if not utilized 

table of contents net income loss net loss was million in compared to net income of million for and million for the net loss included million of significant charges consisting of an income tax expense of million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  a million write off of in process research and development acquired as part of the octigabay acquisition  a million cost adjustment recognized on the red storm fixed price contract  an million restructuring charge and an million write down of excess inventory 
without these significant items our net loss would have been million 
net income for was favorably impacted by the net effect of two significant items recognition of an income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million which was partially offset by a million restructuring charge 
we reversed the valuation allowance based on our determination at that time that realization of these assets was more likely than not 
without these items  net income would have been million 
the improvement in net income compared to  as so adjusted  was due to increased product revenue and expenditures that grew less than the revenue growth  principally net research and development expenses 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  short term investments and accounts receivable totaled million at december   compared to million at december  at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  in the fourth quarter of  we completed a convertible note rule a offering in which we received net proceeds of million 
net cash used by operating activities was million in  million in and million for for the year ended december   net operating cash was used primarily by our net operating loss and increases in inventory offset in part by increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable 
in net operating cash was used primarily by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in other accrued liabilities  warranty reserve and deferred revenues 
for net operating cash was used primarily by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in other accrued liabilities  warranty reserve and deferred revenues 
net cash used by investing activities was million in  million in and million in for the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities consisted million of capital expenditures and million used for the acquisition of octigabay which consisted of million in cash used in connection with the acquisition netted against million in cash we acquired from octigabay s existing business  offset by net sales of  of short term investments 
in our net cash used in investing activities was primarily for purchases of short term investments and in net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of computers and electronic test equipment  computer software and furniture and fixtures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million for the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to our convertible note rule a offering in which we received net proceeds of million 
we also received approximately million through stock option and warrant exercises as well as through the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan and our annual k match 
these proceeds were offset by an increase of million in our restricted cash balance 
the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from our public offering  in which we received net proceeds of million  and million from warrant and stock option exercises 
we used million to retire our term loan debt 
in we raised million primarily through the sale of common stock and employee option exercises  and received another million through warrant exercises 

table of contents over the next twelve months  our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory and spare parts as we ramp up production of cray xe  cray xt and cray xd systems  third party engineering expenses  and acquisition of property and equipment 
our fiscal year capital expenditure budget for property and equipment is estimated currently at million 
in addition  we lease certain equipment used in our operations under operating or capital leases in the normal course of business 
the following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by periods less than after contractual obligations total year years years years development agreements capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of payment for product sales  receipt of prepaid and regular maintenance payments  receipt of government funding of research and development activities and payment for inventory  resulting in significant quarter to quarter and within a quarter fluctuations in our cash balances 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and our operations 
we experienced lower than anticipated product sales and delays in the availability of new products in  and we face increased inventory purchases and higher start up manufacturing and selling costs with the introduction of three new products in late and early our restructuring will lower our overall operating cash expenditures after the severance and related obligations are satisfied 
until we are able to ship our new products  obtain product acceptances and receive payment  we expect to use significant working capital  particularly in the first half of the year 
meanwhile  we are focused on expense controls and working capital efficiencies to maintain adequate levels of cash within each quarter 
we believe our current cash resources and cash expected to be generated in will be adequate for the next twelve months 
our current million secured line of credit is used only to support outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had million of outstanding letters of credit 
we are required to maintain cash and short term investment balances at least equal to the outstanding letters of credit 
as such  we have designated million of our cash as restricted cash at december  if we were to experience a material shortfall in our plan  we would take all appropriate actions to ensure the continuing operation of our business and to mitigate any negative impact on our profitability and cash reserves 
the range of actions we could take includes  in the short term  reductions in inventory purchases and commitments  obtaining a credit facility based on service revenue and seeking further financing from strategic partners and other financial sources and  on a longer term basis  further reducing headcount related expenses  reevaluating our global sales model  restricting or eliminating unfunded product development programs and licensing intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that we would succeed in these efforts or that additional funding would be available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in money market funds or commercial paper of less than days that is held to maturity 
accordingly  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we sell our products primarily in north america  but with significant sales in asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced in us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we commonly sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts occasionally call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  we are 
table of contents subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
we believe that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on the financial statements 
our foreign maintenance contracts are paid in local currencies and provide a natural hedge against local expenses 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
we do not hold any derivative instruments and have not engaged in hedging transactions
