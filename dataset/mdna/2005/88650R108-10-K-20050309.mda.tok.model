item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management strategy in an effort to increase our profitability  we implemented a plan to grow and diversify our operations to become a regional community bank 
in our primary banking market area we have endeavored to position ourselves as a local alternative to national and super regional competitors 
in addition  we have availed ourselves of additional loan opportunities outside our primary banking market area and have selectively entered into relationships with other financial institutions throughout the united states to purchase whole loans or participation interests in loans  particularly commercial real estate and land  second mortgage residential and construction loans 
additionally  we have opened or acquired loan production offices in high growth cities of the united states in an effort to strategically supplement our loan origination activities 
we have also expanded our originations of warehouse mortgage lines of credit to mortgage brokers that primarily serve regions outside of our primary lending market area 
highlights of our management strategy are as follows building a strong corporate brand and identity 
following the introduction of the new tierone bank name in early  we have focused our marketing efforts in building equity in our strong corporate brand 
we have significantly enhanced our marketing by direct mail and other advertising as part of our program to increase the recognition and positive perception of our corporate identity 
we have also continued to develop a strong  focused and innovative employee culture 
we have increased the investment in our professional employee base to help ensure that our team of employees has the capability  training and incentives to deliver quality service across our expanded product line 
continuing our controlled growth and expanding our franchise 
we increased our total assets in each of the past five years 
during this five year period  total assets have increased by billion to billion 
in addition  we believe that our conversion from mutual to stock form in october facilitated our ability to expand our franchise 
we have also employed a strategic acquisition strategy designed to strengthen market share in our primary banking market area as well as to build our lending presence in growing metropolitan areas outside of our primary banking market area 
repositioning our loan portfolio to increase yields and or reduce interest rate risk 
we have focused on increasing our holdings of loans with relatively higher yields and or shorter terms to maturity 
at december   our second mortgage residential  multi family residential  commercial real estate and land  construction  business  agricultural  business  warehouse mortgage lines of credit and consumer loans amounted to billion in the aggregate or of our total loan portfolio 
we generally sell single family fixed rate residential first mortgage loans into the secondary market  with servicing retained 
emphasizing growth of our core deposits and reducing our cost of funds 
our core deposits  consisting of checking accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts  have increased from million at december  to million at december  we continue our emphasis on increasing the number of core checking account relationships  which during the four year period ended december   have grown by from  to  establishment of additional core relationships provide new opportunities to sell other profitable products and services and increase household market share 
the combination of the repricing of time deposits as they matured and deposits assumed in the unfc acquisition resulted in our cost of funds on average interest bearing deposits declining to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  increasing our fee income and expanding our products and services 
our other income  which is noninterest income  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily reflects increased fee income due largely to an increase in the number of core deposit accounts 
we have been pro active in our efforts to increase other income  largely by increasing the number of customers that we serve in our primary banking market area as well as increasing the number of our financial products that our customers utilize 
we expect our employees to cross sell our financial products and services to customers and we provide them with economic incentives to do so 
our efforts have also included redesigning a number of our banking offices to be retail sales centers  which have a floor plan we believe is more conducive to cross selling of products 
we consistently search for new products and services that serve the needs of our customers 
in the past four years  we have introduced on line banking  a high performance checking program  indirect automobile lending  business checking and an expanded business loan program 
maintaining asset quality 
we believe that superior asset quality is key to long term financial success 
we have sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk by using underwriting standards which we believe are conservative 
although we are an active acquirer of mortgage loans and participation interests in loans from outside our primary lending market area  we apply our own underwriting standards to all such loans 
total nonperforming assets have remained relatively low as our asset base has grown and diversified 
our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets at december  was compared to at december  critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
we have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy where amounts are sensitive to material variation 
this policy is significantly affected by our judgment and uncertainties and there is a likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different  but reasonably plausible  conditions or assumptions 
the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because there is a large degree of judgment in assigning individual loans to specific risk levels pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  valuing the underlying collateral securing the loans  determining the appropriate reserve factor to be applied to specific risk levels for special mention loans and those adversely classified substandard  doubtful and loss  and determining reserve factors to be applied to pass loans based upon loan type 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charges to our operating results  in order to maintain a level of total allowance for loan losses that  in management s belief  covers all known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at each reporting date 
management reviews the loan portfolio no less frequently than quarterly in order to identify those inherent losses and to assess the overall collection probability of the loan portfolio 
management s review includes a quantitative analysis by loan category  using historical loss experience  classifying loans pursuant to a grading system and consideration of a series of qualitative loss factors 
the evaluation process includes  among other things an analysis of delinquency trends  nonperforming loan trends  levels of charge offs and recoveries  prior loss experience  total loans outstanding  volume of loan originations  type  size  terms and geographic concentration of loans held by us  value of collateral securing loans  number of loans requiring heightened management oversight  and general economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events change 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements 
the first element is an allocated allowance established for specific loans identified by the credit review function that are evaluated individually for impairment and are considered to be impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured by the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market price 
the second element is an estimated allowance established for losses which are probable and reasonable to estimate on each category of outstanding loans 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses on loans inherent in the portfolio  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess price paid by the company over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired from unfc on august   the date of the acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles balances are not being amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires the intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets is assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable through expected future undiscounted cash flows 
if the total expected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the company s only identifiable intangible asset is the value of the core deposits acquired as part of the unfc acquisition 
determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis  which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions customer attrition  account runoff  alternative funding costs  deposit servicing costs and discount rates 
the core deposit intangible has been estimated to have a year life  with an accelerated rate of amortization 
the company is not aware of any events or circumstances that indicate carrying value or estimated life has changed since the august  acquisition and measurement date 
the company s policy is to annually evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable assets not subject to amortization 
goodwill was established and supported by third party valuations as of august  as part of the unfc acquisition 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions 
there have been no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  due to impairment as the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would indicate the company s carrying value exceeded fair value during the period from the measurement date to december  mortgage servicing rights 
the bank capitalizes the estimated value of mortgage servicing rights upon the sale of loans 
the bank s estimated value takes into consideration contractually known amounts  such as loan balance  term and interest rate 
these estimates are impacted by loan prepayment speeds  servicing costs and discount rates used to present value the cash flow stream 
management evaluates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights on a quarterly basis using current prepayment speed  cash flow and discount rate estimates 
changes in these estimates impact fair value  and could require the bank to record a valuation allowance or recovery 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
generally  as interest rates decline  prepayments accelerate with increased refinance activity  which results in a decrease in the fair value 
as interest rates rise  prepayments generally slow  which results in an increase in the fair value 
all assumptions are reviewed for reasonableness on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary to reflect current and anticipated market conditions 
thus  any measurement of fair value is limited by the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time  and those assumptions may not be appropriate if applied at a different point in time 
derivatives and commitments 
we account for our derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 
 amendment of statement no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including loan commitments and rate lock commitments to extend credit to finance residential mortgages 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the time frame established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates increase or decrease between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered derivatives in accordance with the guidance of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
accordingly  the fair value of these derivatives at the end of the reporting period is based on a quoted market price that closely approximates the amount that would have been recognized if the loan commitment was funded and sold 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing loan commitments  we hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward sale contracts 
these forward contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
the change in the fair value of loan commitments and the change in the fair value of forward sales contracts generally move in opposite directions and  accordingly  the impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential 
although the forward loan sale contracts also serve as an economic hedge of loans held for sale  forward contracts have not been designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
and  accordingly  loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
investment securities 
the company evaluates its available for sale and held to maturity investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income is recognized when the decline in the fair value of investment securities below their cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
the company considers various factors in determining whether it should recognize an impairment charge  including  but not limited to  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than its cost basis and our ability and intent to hold the investment security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
how we manage our risks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk which is inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  we actively manage our interest rate risk exposure 
our profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure 
additionally  our loan portfolio is subject to credit risk 
we manage credit risk primarily through our loan underwriting and oversight policies 
the principal objectives of our interest rate risk management function are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by our board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates 
the extent of the movement in interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on our future earnings 
our board of directors has established an asset liability committee  comprised of executive management  which is responsible for reviewing our asset liability policies and monitoring our interest rate risk position 
the asset liability committee meets on a monthly basis and reports trends and interest rate risk positions to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the company utilizes the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination for portfolio retention of loans with adjustable rates and or shorter terms to maturity  holding shorter term and or adjustable rate investment securities  attempting to reduce the overall interest rate sensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing core and longer term deposits  and extending the maturities on borrowings 
additionally  the company generally sells originated fixed rate  single family residential loans into the secondary market with servicing retained 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of financial modeling software which estimates the change in our net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the ots produces a similar analysis using its own model  based upon data submitted in our quarterly thrift financial reports  the results of which may vary from our internal model primarily due to differences in assumptions utilized  including estimated loan prepayment speeds  reinvestment rates and deposit turnover rates 
the following table sets forth our npv as of december   as calculated by the ots net portfolio value npv as a of portfolio value of assets dollars in thousands amount change change npv ratio change change in interest rates in basis points rate shock static  due to our recognition of the need to control our interest rate exposure  we have focused on higher yielding and shorter term loans which are less subject to interest rate risk and primarily consist of second mortgage residential  multi family residential  commercial real estate and land  construction  agricultural  business  warehouse mortgage lines of credit and consumer loans 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in the interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
we currently do not enter into futures  swaps  or options 
however  we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
the commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require additional collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary 
table of market risk sensitive instruments the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to change in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments

fair value of derivative financial instruments were recorded in the company s statements of financial condition 
expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayment of principal 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected prepayments and repayments of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on our historical experience 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the bank s historical experience 
we are subject to certain market risks and interest rate risks from the time we issue commitments to originate new loans 
in recent years  we have reduced our exposure to interest rate risk by focusing on loans with higher yields and or shorter terms for retention in portfolio and selling most of our single family fixed rate residential first mortgage loans into the secondary market 
in an effort to protect us against adverse interest rate movements  we typically enter into an agreement to sell the loan  or a loan within the same interest rate range  into the secondary market at the time we take an application for a fixed rate loan 
this is known as a matched sale approach and reduces our interest rate risk with respect to these loans 
there is still some risk because some portion of these loans may never close for various reasons 
however  the agencies to whom we sell loans permit us some flexibility in delivering loan product to them 
in certain instances  if the loans we deliver for sale do not match the characteristics outlined in our forward sale commitments  our gain on sale may be reduced 
to date this has not been a significant issue 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements we use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing time deposits and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations excluding bank deposits and interest and lending commitments due in dollars in thousands total at december  year years years after years contractual obligations federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings     recourse obligations on assets   purchase investment securities   annual rental commitments under non cancellable operating leases   due in dollars in thousands total at december  year years years after years lending commitments commitments to originate loans   commitments to sell loans   commitments to purchase loans   undisbursed portion of loans in process   standby letters of credit   unused lines of credit warehouse mortgage lines of credit   business loans   consumer loans   we have not used  and have no intention to use  any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity purposes or otherwise 
our primary financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to loan servicing for others  our obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments and commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans 
in addition  we have certain risks due to limited recourse arrangements on loans serviced for others and recourse obligations related to loan sales 
at december   the maximum total dollar amount of such recourse was approximately million 
based on historical experience  at december   we had established a liability of  with respect to this recourse obligation 
in addition  we have not had  and have no intention to have  any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities
