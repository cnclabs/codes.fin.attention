although we currently maintain  and have traditionally maintained  availability under a bank line of credit  we have no currently outstanding borrowings under our bank line 
our current line of credit agreement expires on march  our businesses are organized into three operating reportable segments based on products and services offered ventiv analytic services through hpr  ventiv commercial services  and ventiv clinical services through the recently acquired smith hanley group of companies  including hhi 
our non operating reportable segment  other  encompasses the activities of our corporate group 
our ventiv commercial services segment is focused on planning  implementing and executing outsourced product commercialization programs for prescription pharmaceutical and other life sciences products in the us this segment maintains and operates the requisite systems  facilities  and support services to rapidly recruit  train and deploy customized  full service and highly targeted sales forces

our ventiv clinical services segment provides recruitment  clinical staffing and data collection and management services 
smith hanley offers outsourced professional staffing  permanent placement and executive search services targeted primarily in the pharmaceutical clinical trials arena 
hhi is a clinical service provider that manages statistical analysis and data management functions on behalf of a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition ventiv commercial services revenues and associated costs under pharmaceutical detailing contracts are generally based on the number of physician calls made or the number of sales representatives utilized 
with respect to risk based contracts  all or a portion of revenues earned are based on contractually defined percentages of either product revenues or the market value of prescriptions written and filled in a given period 
revenues are recognized on ventiv pharma teams contracts as services are performed 
most of our ventiv pharma teams contracts involve two phases  a deployment phase  typically three months  in which we perform initial recruiting  training and preparation for deployment of the field force at the start of a new contract  and the promotion phase in which our deployed field force actively promotes specified products for clients through face to face interactions with physicians referred to as detailing 
most of our ventiv pharma teams contracts specify a separate fee for the initial deployment phase of a project 
we consider the deployment phase to be a separate and distinct earnings process and recognize the related revenues throughout the deployment phase  which typically spans a period of two to three months at the beginning of the first year of a contract 
we generally recognize revenue during the promotion phase of our ventiv pharma teams contracts on a straight line basis based on the size of the deployed field force 
many of the product detailing contracts allow for additional periodic incentive fees to be earned once agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained 
revenue earned from incentive fees is recognized when we are reasonably assured that payment will be made  and is typically based upon verification through calculation of achievement  third party data or client verification 
many contracts also stipulate penalties if agreed upon performance benchmarks have not been met 
these penalties are recognized upon verification of performance shortfalls 
we periodically analyze our detailing contracts to determine the likelihood and amount of any potential loss on a contract resulting from lower than anticipated product or field force performance 
in the event that current information illustrates a loss is likely to be incurred over the remaining life of the contract  we accrue that loss at the time it becomes probable 
non refundable conversion fees are earned and recognized as revenue when one of our sales professionals accepts a firm offer of permanent employment from a customer during the term of a contract 
reimbursable costs including those relating to travel and out of pocket expenses  sales force bonuses tied to individual or product revenues  and other similar costs  are included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services in the period in which such amounts have been finalized 
we provide services to many of our most significant clients under contracts that our clients may cancel  typically on to days notice 
in addition  many of the ventiv pharma teams contracts provide our clients with the opportunity to internalize the sales forces sales force conversion under contract  with sufficient notice 
although ventiv pharma teams has been successful in a number of cases in negotiating longer term commitments and an initial non cancelable contract period  we cannot be assured that clients will renew relationships beyond the expiration date of existing contracts 
normally  if a client terminates a project  the client remains obligated to pay for services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred through the date of termination 
customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms 
contracts that are invoiced prior to performance of related services are recorded as client advances and unearned revenue and are not recognized as revenues until earned  in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
amounts earned for revenues recognized before the agreed upon billing terms have been met are recorded as revenue and included in unbilled services 
upon billing  these amounts are transferred to billed accounts receivable 
ventiv analytic services revenues for hpr generally include fixed fees  which are recognized when monthly services are performed based on percentage of completion and when payment is reasonably assured 
hpr s initial contracts typically range from one month to one year 
revenues for additional services are recognized when the services are provided and payment is reasonably assured 
ventiv clinical services revenues for smith hanley consist mainly of permanent placement and temporary service fees 
we generally record permanent placement services revenue at the time a candidate begins full time employment 
any write offs due to cancellations and or billing adjustments historically have been insignificant 
we record revenue from temporary personnel services  outsourcing and outplacement when services are rendered 
revenue earned but not yet billed as of the end of an accounting period is accrued 
we believe that we have adequate reserves for any potential write offs or adjustments 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of smith hanley and other businesses we have acquired  we have material intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite lived acquired intangibles 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among others  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant  reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
furthermore  changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets  which could result in an impairment of the goodwill 
we performed annual impairment tests in and concluded that the existing goodwill balances were not impaired 
as of december   we recorded goodwill of approximately million and other intangibles net of million in the consolidated balance sheet 
claims and insurance accruals we maintain self insured retention limits for certain insurance policies 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by ventiv are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation and auto liability claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of ventiv differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured annually based on enacted tax laws and rates for temporary differences between the financial accounting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of any loss carryforwards or capital losses 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax items  which are included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
we periodically review these reserves to determine if adjustments to these balances are necessary

the acquisition agreements entered into in connection with the smith hanley  franklin and hhi transactions include earn out provisions pursuant to which the sellers will become entitled to additional consideration  which may be material  if the acquired businesses achieve specified profitability targets during through the amount due with respect to smith hanley for is expected to be approximately million and the amount due with respect to franklin for is expected to be approximately million 
both amounts were accrued at december  these estimates are subject to review mechanisms set forth in the acquisition agreements and there can be no assurance that our estimates will not be revised materially 
there is no provision for an earn out payment under the hhi acquisition agreement with respect to we believe that our cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operating requirements and planned capital expenditures over the next months and for the foreseeable future 
we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures and did not have any such material commitments as of december  we plan to focus on internal growth while continuing to consider acquisition and investment opportunities as they arise 
cash provided by operations may not be sufficient to fund all internal growth initiatives that we may wish to pursue 
if we pursue significant internal growth initiatives or if we wish to acquire additional businesses in transactions that include cash payments as part of the purchase price  we may pursue additional debt or equity sources to finance such transactions and activities  depending on market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in raising the cash required to complete all acquisition  investment or business opportunities which we may wish to pursue in the future 
risks related to our business before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our reports on forms q and k subsequent to the filing of this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on ventiv  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our revenues are dependent on expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  and a variety of factors could cause the overall levels of those expenditures to decline 
our revenues are highly dependent on expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  particularly the pharmaceutical industry  for promotional  marketing and sales  recruiting  clinical staffing and support and compliance services 
any decline in aggregate demand for these services could negatively affect our business 
promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by pharmaceutical manufacturers have in the past been  and could in the future be  negatively impacted by  among other things  governmental reform or private market initiatives intended to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products or by governmental  medical association or pharmaceutical industry initiatives designed to regulate the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their products 
furthermore  the trend in the life sciences industries toward consolidation  by merger or otherwise  may result in a reduction in overall sales and marketing expenditures and  potentially  a reduction in the overall use of outsourced sales and marketing services providers 
companies may elect to perform promotional  marketing and sales services internally based on industry and company specific factors such as the rate of new product development and fda approval of those products  number of sales representatives employed internally in relation to demand for or the need to promote new and existing products  and competition from other suppliers 
companies may elect to perform clinical tasks internally based on industry and company specific factors such as the rate of new product development and fda approval of those products  number of clinical professional employed internally in relation to demand for or the need to develop new drug candidates  and competition from other suppliers 
many of the contracts under which we provide services are subject to termination on short notice  which may make our revenues less predictable 
we provide services to many of our most significant clients under contracts that our clients may cancel  typically on to days notice for pharmaceutical sales contracts and to days for temporary staffing  fda compliance and patient assistance contracts 
in addition  many of our pharmaceutical sales contracts provide our clients with the opportunity to internalize the sales forces under contract  with sufficient notice 
although ventiv has been successful in a number of cases in negotiating longer term commitments and a non cancelable initial period for pharmaceutical sales contracts  ventiv cannot be assured that clients will renew relationships beyond the expiration date of existing contracts in any of its businesses 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our most significant clients will continue to do business with us over the long term 
if any of our significant clients elect to cancel  convert or not renew their contracts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be successful in managing our infrastructure and resources to support continued growth 
our ability to grow depends to a significant degree on our ability to successfully leverage our existing infrastructure to perform services for our clients  as well as on our ability to develop and successfully implement new marketing methods or channels for new services 
our growth will also depend on a number of other factors  including our ability to maintain the high quality of the services we provide to our customers and to increase our penetration with existing customers  to recruit  motivate and retain qualified personnel  and to economically train existing sales representatives and recruit new sales representatives 
we will also be required to implement operational and financial systems and additional management resources to operate efficiently and effectively regardless of market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or expand our operations effectively to address current demand and market conditions 
if we are unable to manage our infrastructure and resources effectively  this could materially adversely affect our business  consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
we employ sophisticated computer technology to deliver our services  and any failure of or damage of this technology could impair our ability to conduct our business 
we have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet many of our clients needs 
we have also invested significantly in sophisticated end user databases and software that enable us to market our clients products to targeted markets 
we anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology and end user databases on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain our competitiveness 
in addition  our business is dependent on our computer equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of this equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our property and business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses that we may incur in any such event 
we are subject to a high degree of government regulation 
significant changes in these regulations  or our failure to comply with them  could impose additional costs on us or otherwise negatively affect our operations 
in connection with the handling and distribution of samples of pharmaceutical products  we are subject to regulation by the prescription drug marketing act of and other applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations in the u 
s 
these laws regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating storage  handling and record keeping requirements for drug samples and by banning the purchase or sale of drug samples 
in addition  certain ethical guidelines promulgated by the american medical association ama govern the receipt by physicians of gifts in connection with the marketing of healthcare products 
these guidelines govern the honoraria and other items of value  which ama physicians may receive  directly or indirectly  from pharmaceutical companies 
any changes in these regulations and guidelines or their application could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  loss of licenses and other penalties and could have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and the healthcare industry  in general  are subject to significant us federal and state regulation 
in particular  regulations affecting the pricing or marketing of pharmaceuticals could make it uneconomical or infeasible for pharmaceutical companies to market their products through medical marketing detailers 
other changes in the domestic and international regulation of the pharmaceutical industry could also have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
our services are subject to evolving industry standards and rapid technological changes 
the markets for our services are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent introduction of new and enhanced services 
to succeed  we must continue to enhance our existing services  introduce new services on a timely and cost effective basis to meet evolving customer requirements  integrate new services with existing services  achieve market acceptance for new services  and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we may be adversely affected by customer concentration 
we have two customers  individually  that accounted for in excess of of our net revenues for the year ended december   and our largest customer during such year accounted for of net revenues 
if any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us  our business  results of consolidated operations or consolidated financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we expect to make future acquisitions  which involve additional risks our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance our existing service offerings  and our ability to introduce new products on a competitive basis 
we have and will continue to address the need to offer additional services through acquisitions of other companies  including the personnel such acquisitions may bring to us 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  or become subject to litigation 
mergers and acquisitions of new businesses are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way

in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding issue no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf 
eitf requires an acquirer in a business combination to evaluate any preexisting relationship with the acquiree to determine if the business combination in effect contains a settlement of the preexisting relationship 
a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be viewed as a multiple element transaction 
eitf is effective for business combinations after october   but requires goodwill resulting from prior business combinations involving parties with a preexisting relationship to be tested for impairment by applying the guidance in the consensus 
the company will apply eitf to acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and in future goodwill impairment testing
