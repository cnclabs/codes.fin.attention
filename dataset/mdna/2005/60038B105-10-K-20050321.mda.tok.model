the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general we were formed as a delaware limited liability company on december   and organized and began operations on january  inception date 
we were converted into a delaware corporation on april  when all of the outstanding equity interests of the limited liability company were converted into shares of common stock of the corporation 
unless otherwise indicated  all information that we present in this annual report for any date or period gives effect to the conversion as if it had occurred on that date or as of the beginning of that period and all references to common stock for periods before the conversion mean our issued and outstanding membership interests 
overview we are engaged in the development of next generation hydrogen energy systems for use primarily in portable electronic devices for the consumer  medical  military and industrial markets 
we are developing this technology in partnership with corporate and government entities 
hydrogen on demand is the trademarked name for our proprietary hydrogen energy storage and delivery technology 
our technology is based on the culmination of work reflected in more than patents either granted or in application that collectively provide us with a leading position in the system and fuel blend technology used to convert sodium borohydride to hydrogen energy for use in portable electronic device applications 
our losses have resulted primarily from costs associated with product development and research and development activities as well as non cash amortization of preferred stock and non cash charges related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to employees and third parties 
as a result of planned expenditures in the areas of research  product development and marketing and additional non cash charges relating to employee stock options  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
results of operations year ended december  versus revenues 
we recorded  of revenues during the year ended december  compared with revenues of  in the decrease was mainly attributable to engineering and design services under a short term contract that was performed during that were non recurring in the current year 
while in the development stage  our revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year with the timing of prototype development and design services 
in the near term  revenues are expected to be derived substantially from up front license fees  research contracts with various federal  state and local agencies  collaborations with other companies  management services  and royalty payments or joint venture revenue from licensees or strategic partnerships 
revenues will be recognized in the period in which technology is delivered  licensing revenues are earned  or as services are performed 
cost of revenues 
we recorded cost of revenues of  during the year ended december   down from  for the year ended december  the decline in cost of revenue was attributable to fewer sales of large prototype systems and services to the transportation markets and more sales of smaller systems designed for the consumer electronics market 
product development and marketing expense 
product development and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease is mostly attributable to ongoing cost reduction activities and our cost shared development program as a subcontractor to protonex for the us air force 
under this program  one half of our incurred costs are reimbursed and recorded as reductions to operating expense 
this program began during the second quarter of general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase was driven mainly by the accrual of separation costs of approximately  as a result of the resignation of our previous president and chief executive officer in march the separation costs were comprised of salary  benefits and other costs in satisfaction of his employment contract 
the remaining costs will be paid according to the following schedule total the unfavorable effect of the separation costs was mostly offset by the impact of ongoing cost reduction programs  including headcount reductions made early in  and the recovery of indirect costs under us government funded cost share programs which began in non cash charges 
non cash charges were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was mostly attributable to the completion of vesting in of below market value options issued to employees during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this was attributable to more assets becoming fully depreciated in fiscal than were added during the year 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease is mainly attributable to the reimbursement of expenses under the department of energy program for the joint research of electrochemical pathways to manufacture sodium borohydride 
this program reimburses us for of our qualifying costs under the program 
interest expense 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to interest expense of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was attributable to the issuance and subsequent conversion of the debentures issued in december and january through a private placement financing 
as the unsecured debentures were converted into common shares  the pro rata portion of the discount and charges related to the beneficial conversion features was recorded as interest expense 
during fiscal  approximately million of the debentures issued in the private placement financing had been converted to common stock as compared to million in fiscal the components of interest expense were as follows for the years ended december  and in millions beneficial conversion feature bcf amortization of debt discount amortization of debt issue costs other interest  net total interest expense benefit from income taxes 
benefit from income taxes was  for the year ended december  as compared to  in this income was derived from our participation in the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program 
this program allows certain companies to transfer new jersey net operating losses to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows each year if we continue to incur net operating losses 
results of operations year ended december  versus revenues 
we recorded  of revenues during the year ended december  compared with revenues of  in the decline in revenue was attributable to fewer sales of large prototype systems and services to the transportation markets and more sales of smaller systems designed for standby power and consumer electronics markets 
in the near term  revenues are expected to be derived substantially from up front license fees  research contracts with various federal  state and local agencies  collaborations with other companies  management services  and royalty payments or joint venture revenue from licensees or strategic partnerships 
revenues will be recognized in the period in which technology is delivered  licensing revenues are earned  or as services are performed 
cost of revenues 
we recorded cost of revenues of  during the year ended december   down from  for the year ended december  the decline in cost of revenue was attributable to fewer sales of large prototype systems and services to the transportation markets and more sales of smaller systems designed for standby power and consumer electronics markets 
cost of revenues on prototype unit sales during the development stage are allocated from the product development and marketing expense and research and development expense line items on the income statement depending on the nature of the project 
product development and marketing expense 
product development and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease is mostly attributable to cost reduction efforts implemented throughout fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was a result of increased efficiency of our administrative and finance organizations as well as the impact of headcount reductions and other cost reduction activities

research and development expense 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease is primarily attributable to the full year impact of the restructuring announced in may as well as other cost reduction programs implemented in interest income expense  net 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to interest income of  for the year ended december   a change of  the increase in interest expense was attributable to the issuance and subsequent conversion of the debentures issued in december and january through a private placement financing

in july  we agreed to acquire a non controlling interest in a european alkaline fuel cell company the affiliate 
during the period from july to june  we directly and indirectly provided limited funding for its proportionate share of the affiliate s operating expenses 
as of june   we had written off its investment in affiliate on the balance sheet and determined the fair value of the investment was zero 
during the third quarter of  we decided to abandon our interest in the affiliate 
no gain or loss was recognized upon this event 
benefit from income taxes 
benefit from income taxes was  for the year ended december  as compared to  in this income was derived from our participation in the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program 
this program allows certain companies to transfer new jersey net operating losses to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows if we continue to have nol s 
liquidity and capital resources general since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering in august and private placements of equity and debt securities 
in  we issued million of membership interests in millennium cell llc for cash  which subsequently were converted into shares of our common stock as of april  we also received a capital contribution of million in the first quarter of  and in may  we sold  shares of series a preferred stock  which automatically converted into  shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering totaled approximately million and we generated net proceeds from private placement transactions in and totaling million 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from a new private placement transaction 
ballard power systems in october  we received million in cash from ballard power systems inc as an advance for prospective royalties pursuant to a product development agreement between ballard and us 
in addition  we granted to ballard a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which was terminated as part of the strategic investment discussed below 
upon completion of certain stages of product development  the parties agreed to negotiate in good faith for the grant of a license of our technology to ballard in certain fields of use  at which time prepaid royalties may be earned and the warrants will be issued and recorded at fair value 
on november   we agreed with ballard that the product development milestones had been achieved and agreed to convert the million refundable royalty payment into an investment in our company in the form of secured convertible debentures with a maturity date of november  the ballard debentures are secured by a standby letter of credit issued by wachovia bank  national association  with an aggregate face amount equal to the outstanding principal 
we will not have the ability to use this cash until the bank pledges are released upon conversion of the ballard debentures to common stock 
the debentures are convertible at a conversion price of  subject to anti dilution adjustments and certain price protection in the event we initiate the conversion 
as part of the purchase agreement we entered into with ballard  ballard retains the option to license the non exclusive right to manufacture and sell products with our hydrogen on demand technology for specific portable fuel cell products and stationary internal combustion engine generators 
private placement transactions during  and  we entered into a series of private placement financing transactions with three different institutional and accredited investors pursuant to the terms of separate securities purchase agreements among the company and the purchasers 
the private placements were exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to section of such act 
the placements collectively raised million dollars through the sale of million in common stock and the issuance of million in convertible debentures 
as of december   approximately million of debentures had been converted into  shares of common stock and million of unsecured debentures remain outstanding 
see note of the notes to financial statements for more information about the private placement transactions 
subsequent events on february   we entered into a stock purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement with the dow chemical company dow 
the stock purchase agreement represents the first step of a proposed joint development arrangement the agreements with dow 
it is required in the joint development agreement  that our stockholders approve the issuance of securities to the extent that such issuance  on an as converted  as exercised basis  is equal to or more of the outstanding common stock of voting power of the company 
we intend to solicit such shareholder approval during our annual meeting of stockholders to be held on april the purpose of the agreements is for the two companies to jointly develop portable power solutions based on our hydrogen on demand energy systems coupled with a fuel cell 
the joint development agreement has a three year term and dow may terminate the joint development agreement if milestones are not met and under certain other conditions 
the joint development agreement contemplates a series of four milestones designed to culminate in a commercially available product 
the milestones are focused on portable and or consumer electronics applications 
achievement of milestones in either portable or consumer electronics applications will be sufficient to trigger equity transactions at dow s option to purchase million of our preferred stock 
for more information regarding this transaction  see our current report on form k filed on february  during the first quarter of  we converted million of debentures into  shares of our common stock 
sources and uses of cash as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of  cash used in operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively  and related to funding our net operating losses 
the restricted cash comprised million of cash used for collateral in connection with ballard s strategic investment in millennium cell and million of cash used for collateral as security deposit held by our landlord in connection with our amended lease agreement for our facility 
these funds used will not be available for use in operations until the letters of credit have been reduced or terminated 
investing activities provided used cash of   and  in  and  respectively 
investing activities in and consisted of an investment in equipment and patent registration costs 
in  investment activities consisted mainly of maturities of investments in high grade government bonds and bank certificates of deposit and purchases of laboratory equipment necessary for the continuation of our research and development activities 
we intend to continue to register  pursue and defend patents on our technology 
commitments and contingencies in april  we amended our main operating lease for our facility to provide for additional space for our principal operating offices and laboratories 
since november  we have occupied all facilities contemplated in the lease agreement 
the amended lease will expire in and contains options to renew for an additional years and will require us to pay our allocated share of taxes and operating cost in addition to the annual base rent payment 
future minimum annual lease commitments excluding estimated allocated taxes and maintenance under the amended operating leases are noted below rent expense under the operating lease was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in connection with the amended lease agreement  we issued a letter of credit to the landlord for  in lieu of a cash security deposit 
we collateralized the letter of credit with a portion of our cash and classified the letter of credit as restricted cash 
the funds used for collateral will not be available for use in operations 
between january and april  we received an aggregate of  from a recoverable grant award from the state of new jersey commission on science and technology 
the funds were used to partially fund costs directly related to development of our technology 
the recoverable grant is required to be repaid when we generate net sales in a fiscal year 
the repayment obligation  which began in june  escalating from to of net sales over a ten year period 
we are obligated to repay the unpaid amount of the original grant at the end of the ten year period 
as of december   we have repaid approximately  and an additional  is due to be paid in the contractual obligations discussed above is outlined in the following table payment due in fiscal years contractual obligations total operating lease facility refundable grant obligation capital lease obligations convertible secured debentures convertible unsecured debentures accrued severance total we received net proceeds from the sale of new jersey net operating losses nol s in conjunction with the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program of   and  in  and  respectively 
this program allows certain companies to apply to transfer new jersey nol s to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows if we continue to incur nol s 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash generated from our operations and cost sharing agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first half of we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be assured that additional funding  if sought  will be available or will be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have had a material effect on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
our management has discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  convertible debt and stock options described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition our near term revenues will be derived substantially from contracts that require the company to deliver hydrogen generation technology  management services  system design and prototype systems and licensing of technology for test and evaluation 
we anticipate that revenues will be recognized in the period in which the technology is delivered or licensed revenue is earned 
convertible debt we account for the issuance and conversion of convertible debt in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
as a result  we have and will record original issue discounts to the extent the fair value of the debt is below the face value of the instrument and amortize the discount over the life of the instrument 
to the extent conversions of debt into common stock are made prior to the maturity date of the instrument  we will record as interest expense a ratable proportion of the discount associated with the face value of the debt converted 
we account for issuances of convertible debt in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments eitf no 
 and eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 

as a result of certain conversion price discounts included within our outstanding debt instruments  we will record interest expense resulting from bcfs as described under the caption liquidity and capital resources above 
stock options we have recorded non cash charges in  and of the fair value of warrants issued to certain affiliates and third parties 
certain affiliates have the ability to earn new awards based on defined milestones and service periods 
the accounting methodology requires a re valuing of the related earned warrants at each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
due to this variable accounting methodology  it is difficult to predict the amount of additional non cash charges we will incur related to these warrants 
we also record non cash charges for the difference between the grant price and market price on the date of grant related to certain stock options issued to employees and elected directors below market prices as defined by apb no 
the non cash charge is recognized ratably over the related vesting period of the respective option contracts 
as of june   all of these options were vested 
we also disclose pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share that is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
we have estimated the fair value of options granted for the fiscal years ended december   and at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
our options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
due to these highly subjective assumptions  the non cash charges incurred in  and for warrants issued to affiliates and the pro forma disclosures of net loss and loss per share for fiscal  and  are not likely to be representative of non cash charges and the pro forma effects on net loss and loss per share  respectively  in future years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires a public entity to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  sfas r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options if they are issued at the fair market value of common stock at the date of the grant 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will be depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas r is similar to sfas  with minor exceptions 
for information about what our reported results of operations and earnings per share would have been had we adopted sfas  please see the discussion under the heading stock based compensation in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
due to timing of the release of sfas r  we have not yet completed the analysis of the ultimate impact that this new pronouncement will have on the results of operations  nor the method of adoption for this new standard 
in october  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
their conclusion was that beginning with reporting periods ending after december  i contingently convertible debt instruments are subject to the if converted method under sfas no 
 earnings per share  regardless of the contingent features included in the instrument  and ii prior period earnings per share would have to be restated 
our secured and unsecured convertible debentures are contingently convertible debt instruments that are potentially convertible into approximately million shares of common stock 
with the ratification of eitf issue no 
 we were required to include such potentially issuable shares  if dilutive  in its diluted earnings per share calculation beginning with the fourth quarter reporting period 
we did not have to restate our prior period earnings per share since the issuable shares would have been anti dilutive 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in us interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and are generally of a short term nature 
as a result  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
our systems ability to produce energy depends on the availability of sodium borohydride  which has a limited commercial use and is not manufactured in vast quantities 
there are currently only two major manufacturers of sodium borohydride and there can be no assurance that the high cost of this specialty chemical will be reduced 
once we commence full operations in the future  we may need to enter into long term supply contracts to protect against price increases of sodium borohydride 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into these agreements to protect against price increases
