item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
noble energy is an independent energy company engaged  directly or through its subsidiaries or various arrangements with other companies  in the exploration  development  production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas 
the company has exploration  exploitation and production operations domestically and internationally 
the domestic areas consist of offshore in the gulf of mexico and california  the gulf coast region louisiana and texas  the mid continent region oklahoma and kansas  and the rocky mountain region colorado  montana  nevada  wyoming and california 
the international areas of operations include argentina  china  ecuador  equatorial guinea  the mediterranean sea israel and the north sea the netherlands and the united kingdom 
the company also markets domestic crude oil and natural gas production through a wholly owned subsidiary  nemi 
the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
executive overview noble energy s principal business strategy has been to create shareholder value by generating stable cash flow and production from domestic operations  while generating growth from international projects 
in the us  the company has a substantial onshore and offshore asset base located in established  prolific basins where the company is aggressively pursuing exploration and exploitation opportunities 
offshore  exploration focuses on the deepwater and deep shelf areas of the gulf of mexico 
internationally  the company has built a strong project portfolio and has applied innovative approaches to developing markets for stranded natural gas  including construction of a natural gas fired power plant near machala  ecuador  and liquefied petroleum gas and methanol plants in equatorial guinea 
the company had a successful year  both financially and operationally  in financial highlights included the following record net income of million  or per share  cash flow from operating activities of million  a million reduction in outstanding debt with a year end debt to book capital ratio of percent  issuance of million senior notes  increased financial flexibility with an additional million credit facility  and completion of asset disposition program first announced in july operational highlights included the following a percent increase in daily equivalent production over ticonderoga deepwater discovery in the gulf of mexico  new projects in the deepwater gulf of mexico  commencement of natural gas sales in israel  phase a ramp up in equatorial guinea  and acquisition of interests in two psc s with the republic of equatorial guinea 
domestic domestic operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil in  and a four percent overall increase in production 
during  noble energy participated in gross domestic exploration and development wells  of which were successful 
based on the results of successful infill pilot projects drilled during  regulatory approval for acre drilling density was granted for development of the niobrara formation in northeast colorado 
noble energy plans to drill up to development wells in the niobrara trend in the program is now underway with three drilling rigs currently operating in the area 
during  the company s domestic division continued to make progress on significant deepwater developments in the gulf of mexico that are expected to add substantial new production through swordfish viosca knoll  and well completions have been finished  with production expected to commence from three wells in the second quarter of at an initial rate of approximately  boepd  net to the company 
noble energy has a percent working interest in swordfish 
lorien green canyon an appraisal well is currently underway  with production expected to commence in the first half of at an initial rate of approximately  boepd  net to the company 
noble energy has a percent working interest in lorien 
ticonderoga green canyon successful exploration results were announced in april  with production expected to commence by mid at an initial rate of approximately  to  boepd  net to the company 
noble energy has a percent working interest in ticonderoga 
production from main pass in the gulf of mexico remains shut in as a result of damage caused by hurricane ivan during september estimated shut in production totaled  boepd during fourth quarter and  boepd during third quarter the effect on total year production was  boepd 
the company believes it has insurance coverage in an amount sufficient to make necessary repairs in order to re establish production at main pass 
costs related to clean up and redevelopment are insured to a limit that the company believes will allow for restoration of production 
the loss of production is not covered by business interruption insurance 
international during and  the company completed major  capital intensive projects in ecuador  china  israel and the phase a expansion  the first phase of a two phase project in equatorial guinea 
with these important projects completed  international capital commitments declined 
during and  these projects contributed significantly to the company s financial and operating results 
the phase b expansion in equatorial guinea is underway and is scheduled to be completed during the phase b expansion is expected to increase both lpg and condensate production 
the project includes increasing processing capacity  storage and offloading facilities at the existing lpg plant 
during  international production volumes increased  boepd  or percent  compared to last year  primarily from increased production in equatorial guinea  due to the continued ramp up of the phase a expansion project  and the commencement of natural gas sales in israel 
international operations also benefited from higher realized commodity prices 
during  noble energy participated in gross international exploration and development wells  of which were successful 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
when alternatives exist among various accounting methods  the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
the following is a discussion of the company s accounting policies  estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in its application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
reserves all of the reserve data in this form k are estimates 
the company s estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by the company s engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also trigger an impairment analysis and could result in an impairment charge 
sec guidelines do not limit reserve bookings to only contracted volumes if it can be demonstrated that there is reasonable certainty that a market exists 
the company has booked reserves in excess of contracted volumes for israel due to the reasonable certainty of the existence of markets in future periods 
in israel  the company has a natural gas contract with iec  which is expected to run through  and a contract with the israel bazan refinery through the year the israeli natural gas market  as estimated by the israeli ministry of national infrastructure  from to  is significantly greater than noble energy s uncontracted net estimated proved reserves 
oil and gas properties the company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting 
the alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method 
under the successful efforts method  costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit of production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property by property basis as estimated by company engineers 
application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals  during the periods the costs are incurred 
under the full cost method  these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of dd a expense 
the company believes the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use to account for its crude oil and natural gas production activities because during periods of active exploration  this method results in a more conservative measurement of net assets and net income 
if the company had used the full cost method  its financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different 
exploratory well costs in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting  the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well including costs in work in progress and suspended costs on go forward projects may be capitalized temporarily  or suspended  pending a determination of whether commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas have been discovered 
except as noted below  the company does not capitalize the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well for more than one year following completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds crude oil and natural gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and the well has found sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future 
for certain capital intensive deepwater gulf of mexico or international projects  it may take the company more than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability 
the company s ability to move forward on a project may be dependent on gaining access to transportation or processing facilities or obtaining permits and government or partner approval  the timing of which is beyond the company s control 
in such cases  exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such permits and approvals and believes they will be obtained 
management continuously monitors suspended exploratory well costs until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired 
these costs may be charged to exploration expense in future periods if the company decides not to pursue additional exploratory or development activities 
at december   the balance of property  plant and equipment included million of suspended exploratory well costs  of which million had been capitalized for a period greater than one year 
the wells relating to these suspended costs continue to be evaluated by various means including additional seismic work  drilling additional wells or evaluating the potential of the exploration wells 
for more information  see note capitalized exploratory well costs of this form k 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company assesses proved crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
the company recognizes an impairment loss as a result of a triggering event and when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than the current net book value 
estimated future cash flows are based on management s expectations for the future and include estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs 
downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment 
the company recorded million of impairments in  primarily related to downward reserve revisions on two domestic properties 
the company recorded million of impairments in  primarily related to a reserve revision on a property in the gulf of mexico after recompletion and remediation activities produced less than expected results 
the company also performs periodic assessments of individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  estimated future commodity prices and operating costs  availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political climate in areas in which the company operates impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions 
asset retirement obligation the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
at december   the company s balance sheet included a liability for aro of million  including million for damage caused by hurricane ivan 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company uses various derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to price risk from changing commodity prices 
except for nemi s use of derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to natural gas price risk  the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in determining types of instruments to be used  production volumes to be hedged  prices at which to hedge and the counterparties and the hedging counterparties creditworthiness 
the company accounts for its derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings 
therefore  prior to settlement of the derivative instruments  changes in the fair market value of those derivative instruments can cause significant increases or decreases in aoci 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value must be reported in the current period  rather than in the period in which the forecasted transaction occurs 
this may result in significant increases or decreases in current period net income 
all hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the current period in net income 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide 
for financial reporting purposes  the company provides taxes at rates applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdictions 
estimates of amounts of income tax to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws  including the recently enacted american jobs creation act of  and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on domestic taxes 
the company s balance sheet includes deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the future periods to absorb future deductible temporary differences or loss carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers all available evidence both positive and negative in determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence 
as a result of management s assessment during  the company decreased the valuation allowances associated with certain foreign loss carryforwards from million at december  to zero december  the company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in its reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  the company may determine that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be established 
any increases or decreases in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense 
for a discussion of the effect on the company of the american jobs creation act of  see impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements of this form k 
pension plan the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans 
the actuarial determination of the projected benefit obligation and related benefit expense requires that certain assumptions be made regarding such variables as expected return on plan assets  discount rates  rate of compensation increase  estimated employee turnover rates and retirement dates  lump sum election rates  mortality rate  retiree utilization rates for health care services and health care cost trend rates 
the selection of assumptions requires considerable judgment concerning future events and has a significant impact on the amount of the obligation recorded on the company s balance sheets and on the amount of expense included on the company s statements of operations  as well as on funding 
noble energy bases its determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of december   the company had cumulative asset losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the company utilizes the services of an outside actuarial firm to assist in the calculations of the projected benefit obligation and related costs 
the company and its actuaries use historical data and forecasts to determine assumptions 
in selecting the assumption for expected long term rate of return on assets  the company considers the average rate of earnings expected on the funds to be invested to provide for plan benefits 
this includes considering the plan s asset allocation  historical returns on these types of assets  the current economic environment and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan 
it is assumed that the long term asset mix will be consistent with the target asset allocation of percent equity and percent fixed income  with a range of plus or minus percent acceptable degree of variation in the plan s asset allocation 
the discount rate is determined by analyzing the interest rates implicit in current annuity contract prices and available yields on high quality fixed income securities 
by definition  discount rates reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
a one percent decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would have increased benefit expense by 
million 
the expected return assumption for is percent and the assumed discount rate for is percent 
the expected return assumption was the same as and the assumed discount rate was percent for liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary cash needs are to fund capital expenditures related to the acquisition  exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties  to repay outstanding borrowings or to pay other contractual commitments  for interest payments on debt  to pay cash dividends on common stock and to fund contributions to the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company s traditional sources of liquidity are its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities 
funds may also be generated from occasional sales of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties 
the company made significant progress during and in improving liquidity and financial flexibility 
reduction in international capital commitments due to completion of major capital intensive projects has increased flexibility and liquidity in with these projects completed or nearing completion  international capital commitments have declined while  at the same time  they have begun to contribute to the company s financial and operating results 
a new million credit facility will also provide increased liquidity in the company achieved a reduction in its ratio of debt to book capital defined as the company s total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus equity to percent at december   compared to percent at december  the company reduced outstanding debt by million during the company s current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities was at december   compared with 
at december  the improvement in the current ratio in  as compared to  resulted primarily from a million increase in the year end balance of cash and cash equivalents  and a million decrease in current installments of long term debt 
in addition  the year end balance of accounts receivable trade increased by million due primarily to increases of million for gas sales at nemi  million for joint operations receivables  million for crude oil and natural gas accruals in the us and us and million for electricity sales in ecuador 
cash flows operating activities the company reported a million year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increases for and were driven by overall production increases  higher realized commodity prices and higher distributions from the company s unconsolidated methanol subsidiary

in addition  the company received million from the exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures selected capital expenditures incurred in oil and gas activities  acquisitions and downstream projects consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands oil and gas mineral interests  equipment and facilities proved property acquisition costs unproved property acquisition costs downstream projects total capital expenditures during increased million  or percent  as compared with the increase included costs related to the acquisition of deepwater gulf of mexico interests and costs expended in further development of the amistad gas field in ecuador 
capital expenditures during declined million or percent from this decrease in spending was the result of declining capital commitments due to the completion  or near completion  of major capital intensive projects in international locations 
capital expenditures  as included in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows  and the capital expenditures budget were as follows year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures from investing activities capital expenditures budget capital expenditures during were lower than budgeted amounts due to timing of capital outlays  which were delayed until  for certain projects in the gulf of mexico  the united kingdom  israel and phase b in equatorial guinea 
capital spending in excess of budget for was primarily due to the acceleration of the initial costs to begin the phase b expansion in equatorial guinea 
during  additional capital expenditures were for the completion of the natural gas to power project in ecuador and the continued development of the israel project 
budget the company has budgeted capital expenditures of million for approximately percent of the capital budget has been allocated for exploration opportunities  and percent has been dedicated to production  development and other projects 
domestic spending is budgeted at million percent of the worldwide capital budget  international expenditures are budgeted at million percent and corporate expenditures are budgeted at million three percent 
the budget does not include the impact of noble energy s possible asset purchases or the previously announced proposed merger with patina 
the company expects that its capital expenditure budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations 
the company will evaluate its level of capital spending throughout the year based upon drilling results  commodity prices  cash flows from operations and property acquisitions 
discontinued operations and asset sales during  the company completed an asset disposition program  including five domestic property packages that had first been announced during july the sales price for the five property packages totaled approximately million before closing adjustments 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations and assets of the properties being sold as discontinued operations

the company s credit agreements are supplemented by short term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes 
the uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing 
debt issuances during april  the company closed an offering of million senior unsecured notes receiving net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses 
the notes mature april  and pay interest semi annually at percent 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit agreements and for general corporate purposes 
during first quarter  a subsidiary of the company  noble energy mediterranean  ltd  entered into term loan agreements with several commercial lending institutions for a total of million
