the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to income taxes  inventory allowances  contingencies and to a lesser extent  bad debts 
the company bases its estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in footnote to the financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include revenue recognition net sales include the sale of goods to customers and custom installation revenue 
retail sales are recorded at the time of sale to the customer 
custom installation revenue  which is comprised of both the sale of products and the labor in connection with the installation of the products  are recorded in accordance with the provisions of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the revenue related to the sale of the products is recognized when the product is delivered to the customers

purchase based volume rebates are credited to inventory or cost of products sold  as appropriate 
the company assesses the market value of its inventory on a regular basis by reviewing  on an item by item basis  the realizable value of its inventory  net of specific or general lower of cost or market reserves 
if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to estimated realizable sales value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing realizable value including the quantity on hand  historical sales  technological advances  the existence of a replacement product  and consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate 
as a result we have reduced our net inventory value to reflect our estimated amount of inventory with lower of cost or market issues 
our inventory reserve at october  and november  is  and  respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and reorganization value are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company recognizes an impairment loss when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its value upon disposal are less than its carrying amount 
if the company s estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows or useful lives were to change  we could be exposed to losses that are material in nature 
in fiscal  the company provided a provision for the impairment of long lived assets aggregating  relating to the relocation of its bang olufsen branded store in greenwich  connecticut 
cash discounts and cooperative advertising the company receives cash discounts for timely payment of merchandise invoices and recognizes these amounts in its statement of operations as a reduction of cost of sales 
the company also receives substantial funds from its suppliers for cooperative advertising 
these funds are used for advertising purposes and the funds earned are recorded net of advertising expenditures  and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
accrued expenses the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made which relate to the current accounting period 
these estimates range from things such as accrued bonuses to estimates of pending litigation claims and income taxes 
in establishing appropriate accruals  management must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement that will ultimately be incurred 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid could differ from management s estimate
