item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the company s financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
it includes the following sections overview consolidated results vs 
vs 
business segment results liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates forward looking statements overview lesco is the largest provider of products to the professional turf care segment of the green industry 
the professional users of our products include lawn care and landscape firms and the employees of a variety of commercial  governmental  institutional and industrial establishments  including golf courses  sod farms  airports  cemeteries  professional sports organizations  universities  schools  commercial properties and numerous other organizations that use in house employees to maintain lawns  grounds and gardens 
we track our customers through two customer sectors lawn care and golf 
gross sales for these sectors were as follows for the past three years dollars in millions lawn care golf the separation of our customers into these two sectors is important as distribution to the sectors is vastly different and their growth prospects vary significantly 
our lawn care sector includes all non golf related customers and is dominated by lawn care and landscape firms 
historically  industry wide distribution of products into this sector has been fragmented and inefficient 
we believe that our model of service centers and direct sales provides efficiency to the sector s distribution channels through easily accessible  strategically positioned real estate  where we provide 
table of contents agronomic expertise through our service centers and direct sales associates with products specifically targeted to the lawn care sector 
we generated million of sales through our new service centers opened in the last two years 
we estimate the market for our consumable lawn care products at billion of which billion is in the professional sector and billion is in the consumer sector 
independent research indicates that organic growth in the industry is expected to exceed annually for the next several years due to the aging of the baby boomers and their increasing desire to contract lawn care professionals  the higher number of two income families and continued time constraints on consumers 
the golf industry is a smaller market estimated at billion and is not expected to grow significantly during the near future  nor do we believe our opportunities are as great in this sector as they are in the lawn care sector 
over the past few years  the industry has experienced a decline in annual rounds of golf played  which has decreased the budgets of golf course superintendents 
the ability to capture incremental market share is limited as distribution of products to the golf industry is dominated by a few national and regional distributors 
however  we anticipate that we will be able to extend our presence in under serviced markets  as we implement a more efficient and lower cost stores on wheels operating model  which we believe will allow us to expand our fleet and our customer base 
our historical financial performance and returns on invested capital through were unacceptable 
we operated three business lines that consumed capital selling  support including manufacturing and distribution operations and credit financing 
based upon the opportunities that were available in our customer sectors and opportunities for improvement in our financial performance  beginning in we embarked on a strategy to reposition lesco in order to effectively capitalize on our opportunities 
the following is a summary of the changes we made to our business  along with any financial impacts  over the past two years asset rationalization prior to  we performed an analysis of our manufacturing facilities  utilizing a methodology balancing sales growth opportunities and return on invested capital roic  and decided to rationalize certain under performing assets 
the plan included ceasing operations at  and deciding to sell  two manufacturing facilities a methylene urea facility in disputanta  virginia and a blending facility in stockton  california and the sale of certain other properties 
in conjunction with the announcement of the asset rationalization plan  we recorded a reserve to provide for the remaining obligations associated with each site 
at december    remained in the reserve pertaining to these properties primarily representing future lease and real estate tax payments 
the disputanta facility was sold in and the other rationalized facilities remain as assets held for sale as of december  all future costs incurred to prepare the sites for sale  including environmental testing and environmental remediation costs will be capitalized up to the realizable market value of each respective property 
launch of sales growth programs we launched various programs designed to increase sales a 
selling locations  management structure and reporting we organized our selling locations into five geographic zones northeast  mid central  transition  southeast and west and a national accounts zone 
the geographic zones are comprised of regional geographic areas 
additionally  we developed separate operating statements four wall p ls for each selling location see further discussion business segment results and note to consolidated financial statements 
the restructured management structure and four wall p ls provide the requisite management oversight and reporting to effectively identify and address geographic operational opportunities 
we have added a sixth geographic zone  mid atlantic  beginning in  whose territory previously had been included predominately in the northeast and mid central zones 
b 
new service center program lesco did not open any new service centers from until our analysis of service center four wall p ls and four wall roic indicated that with a total capital and working capital investment of  to  an average service center at maturity generates approximately million of sales and a roic of approximately 
we thereafter performed a statistical analysis utilizing historical service center operating performance  published industry data and government data relative to the us metropolitan statistical areas 
the statistical results indicated ample opportunity to expand the number of service centers in the 
table of contents continental united states by over locations 
we began a service center opening program resulting in new service centers in and new service centers in  with an expectation to open an additional to service centers in c 
reduction of direct sales force prior to  we expanded our direct sales force to professionals 
during the first half of  we evaluated the program s performance and determined that the program was not performing to our expectations 
as a result  we reduced the direct sales force by professionals 
during  we incurred approximately million of costs related to the program 
through the workforce reduction in june  million of these costs were eliminated on a go forward basis 
capital restructuring during and  we restructured our debt and equity capital structure 
the following summarizes these initiatives a 
refinancing the refinancing comprised the following two initiatives i 
agreements with ge business credit services on december   the company sold a majority of its trade accounts receivable portfolio to ge capital financial inc  dba ge business credit services gebcs  for cash proceeds of approximately million 
in  approximately million of additional cash proceeds were obtained through the sale of some of our remaining receivable accounts 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax charge of million recorded in concurrently with the sale  the company and gebcs entered into a private label business credit program agreement credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  gebcs extends commercial credit to qualified customers of lesco and funds the program sales  less program fees and discounts  within three business days 
the credit agreement also provides the company the option of extending deferred payment terms to customers through the payment of incremental promotional discounts 
the in transit funds are recognized by the company as cash equivalents 
the program fees and discounts and promotional discounts are recognized as merchant discounts in the consolidated statement of operations 
gebcs is the exclusive owner of the program accounts and  except for the recourse account portfolio retained by the company  bears all credit losses 
the credit agreement has a five year term with automatic three year renewals unless either party terminates at least six months prior to the end of the expiration of a term 
ii 
debt refinancing additionally on december   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility the facility which replaced our prior credit facility 
borrowings under the facility were used to retire the prior credit facility  including the term loan  buy out the interest rate swap agreement for million and buy back outstanding preferred stock  including accrued dividends  for million 
a charge of million was recorded in to expense the unamortized portion of the deferred financing costs of the prior credit facility 
the facility matures december  and is secured by inventory  owned receivables  equipment  investment interests  real property interests  and general intangibles  including intellectual property 
the facility bears interest at libor plus to  based on the level of borrowings  and requires the payment of a facility fee ranging from to on the unused portion of availability 
availability under the facility is determined by a borrowing base formula calculated on eligible inventory 
as of december   there was million available  based on the borrowing base formula  with unused borrowing capacity of million 
letters of credit  up to a maximum of million  are also available under the facility and are considered outstanding borrowings when calculating the unused portion of availability 
letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million were outstanding as of december  letter of credit fees range from to with an issuance fee ranging from to 

table of contents the interest rate  facility fee  letter of credit fee and letter of credit issuance fee are determined based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on the company s outstanding borrowing under the facility as of december  was 
the facility requires the maintenance of certain covenants  with the only financial covenant being the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with the facility covenants as of december  the amount of deferred financing charges associated with the facility included in prepaid and other non current assets was  as of december  b 
debt reduction during the fourth quarter of  we elected to call our industrial development revenue bonds prior to their maturity date 
these bonds were related to our martins ferry  ohio facility 
there was no prepayment penalty for the early extinguishment of the million debt  which was financed by funding from our revolving credit facility  which provided a lower interest rate than the rate being charged by the bonds 
relocation of corporate headquarters during the third quarter of  we entered into agreements to relocate our corporate headquarters from our approximately  square foot facility in strongsville  ohio to an approximately  square foot facility in downtown cleveland  ohio 
relocation costs incurred during were million and were primarily related to tenant and landlord inducements along with broker commissions and legal fees 
beginning in  the financial effect of the relocation is expected to be accretive to earnings on an annual  pre tax basis by approximately million 
we reduced our lease commitment for corporate offices by five years as the lease on the strongsville facility expires in while the current corporate headquarters lease expires in vendor contract termination in the fourth quarter of  we notified kpac  our supplier of methylene urea fertilizer  that we were terminating our performance under a five year supply agreement 
the agreement  signed in november  required the company to purchase annually  tons of methylene urea fertilizer at a fixed conversion cost of per ton see item legal proceedings for further discussion 
management believes that it will generate an annual  pre tax savings of more than million over the remaining term of the agreement  which aggregate savings are expected to exceed the estimated million cost to exit the supply agreement 
we already have secured an alternative  lower cost source of methylene urea fertilizer from other available market sources with no annual purchase commitments 
exploring supply chain alternatives in january  we announced that we have retained western reserve partners llc to continue and advance our exploration of supply chain alternatives  including the possibility of the disposition of all or a portion of our distribution and manufacturing assets 
other a 
divestiture of joint venture in  we sold our investment in commercial turf products ltd 
ctp to mtd consumer group  inc mtd for a  promissory note and a release from our guarantee of certain of ctp s liabilities  including an million industrial revenue bond 
ctp is a manufacturer of commercial grade riding and walk behind turf mowers  blowers  turf renovators  spreaders  sprayers  associated accessories and service parts 
the note is payable in five equal  annual installments of  which began in november we recorded a  gain on the sale in concurrently with the sale  we entered into a five year supply agreement with ctp and mtd 
during the term of the agreement  we maintain the exclusive rights to market and sell proprietary products  such as commercial grade spreaders  sprayers  renovators and blowers and retain certain customer rights 
we are not required to exclusively source products from ctp and mtd 
additionally  we have the option to exercise a buyout of the agreement prior to the expiration of the five year term 
the agreement provides for the following minimum annual purchase targets based on historical purchases and our projected growth rates million in  million in  million 
table of contents in and million in to the extent our actual annual purchases are less than the applicable minimum purchase targets  the price on purchased products will increase 
pricing during the term of the agreement is based on pricing prior to the supply agreement  adjusted by changes in the producers price index  not to exceed two percent annually 
b 
deferred tax asset valuation reserves in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
in making this assessment  we considered historical earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
the recent cumulative losses create uncertainty about the realization of the tax benefits in future years which cannot be overcome by other available evidence 
as a result  a valuation allowance of million was recorded as of december  to fully reserve for the company s net deferred tax assets and an additional million was recorded in to reserve for deferred tax assets generated in 
table of contents consolidated results we believe that the most useful analysis of our consolidated results should reflect adjustments to our results on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis for the impacts of certain of the previously discussed strategic initiatives excluding the growth initiatives and their positive and negative effects and other events that management does not expect to recur on an annual basis 
a reconciliation to gaap of our financial results excluding the operational impact of these initiatives and events is as follows consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  for the year ended december  results results gaap adjustments excluding gaap adjustments excluding results a adjustments results b adjustments dollars in thousands  except per share data net sales cost of product cost of inventory markdown contract termination distribution cost gross profit on sales selling expense general administrative expense merchant discounts and provision for doubtful accounts pre opening expense early retirement of debt agreement loss from sale of accounts receivable corporate relocation expense hurricane flood expense vendor contract termination other expense other income earnings loss before interest and taxes interest expense  net earnings loss before taxes income tax provision benefit current deferred change in valuation allowance net income loss earnings loss per common share diluted basic a adjustments include million for corporate relocation  million for hurricane and flood damage  million for a vendor contract termination  and million for estimated tax provision at

we plan to open an additional to service centers in other selling locations all other gross sales reflect sales transacted through our direct sales programs and our stores on wheels 
the increase of is attributable to the year over year growth in sales to retail and international customers along with the slight increase in sales to customers in the golf industry 
although we experienced sales expansion in our direct channels  we continue to evaluate the returns relative to contract accounts and have instituted disciplines to assure contracts meet acceptable return thresholds 
this program has  on occasion  resulted in lost contract sales  and we will continue to cull out account sales that do not produce an acceptable level of return on our investment 
agency sales  freight revenue and customer discounts and rebates the company has entered into agency agreements with certain of its suppliers whereby the company operates as a sales agent of those suppliers 
the suppliers retain title to their merchandise until it is sold by the company and determine the prices at which lesco can sell the suppliers merchandise 
as such  the company recognizes sales on a net basis and records only its product margin as revenue 
therefore  the million of agency sales for represent the portion of gross revenue that exceeds the company s net product margin 
freight revenue  which represents fees charged to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales

table of contents our largest single purchased product or raw material is urea  the nitrogen source for blended fertilizers and combination products 
urea can represent from approximately to of our cost of sales 
urea is a second derivative of natural gas and its cost fluctuates with the changing cost of natural gas 
average urea costs increased approximately over costs  which unabated would have resulted in an estimated deterioration in product margin percentage 
however  through price increases and other cost of sales reductions  particularly the cost per ton to blend fertilizer products  we successfully mitigated its effect on product margin 
the decline in product margin from was due to the markdown charge related to the elimination of merchandise from the company s product offering associated with a vendor contract termination 
for  we have entered a contract with our urea supplier to fix the cost of a majority of our urea needs at a price reflecting the prevailing market in mid in  we continued to optimize efficiencies in our distribution network that was expanded late in the expansion added fixed costs to our operations to support our expected growth in service center units and comparable sales increases

in december  we sold our trade accounts receivable portfolio to gebcs for million and entered into a private label business credit program agreement with gebcs

this arrangement has resulted in increased merchant discounts as we pay program fees and discounts to gebcs 
total merchant discount expense  including gebcs  for normal payment terms was of net sales while promotional discount expense was an additional of net sales 
although merchant discount expense increased year over year  interest expense  provision for doubtful accounts  the general and administrative costs to service the previous in house credit program and customer finance revenue have been significantly reduced as compared to corporate relocation expense during the third quarter of  we entered into agreements to relocate our corporate headquarters from our approximately  square foot facility in strongsville  ohio to an approximately  square foot

we reduced our lease commitment for corporate offices by five years as the lease on the strongsville facility expires in while the current corporate headquarters lease expires in hurricane flood expense during the third quarter of  the company incurred losses at its sebring  fl and martins ferry  oh manufacturing facilities due to hurricane activity in florida and the related rainfall and flooding activity in ohio 
the total damages were million  primarily resulting from the loss of bulk urea and sulfur coated urea that was stored at a third party terminal located adjacent to the ohio river 
additionally  there was roof and siding damage sustained at the sebring facility 
we continue to evaluate our claims against the warehouse and other possible avenues of assistance and intend to pursue all means available to recoup this loss 
any future recovery will be reported in the period in which the recovery is reasonably certain 
vendor contract termination in the fourth quarter of  we informed our supplier of methylene urea fertilizer  kpac  that the company will no longer operate under the terms of the supply agreement with kpac 
the five year supply agreement between lesco and kpac was entered into in november and requires the company to purchase  tons of methylene urea fertilizer annually from kpac at a fixed conversion cost of per ton plus the prevailing commodities market prices which were approximately per ton in see item legal proceedings for further discussion 
management believes that termination of the agreement will generate an annual  pre tax savings of more than million over the remaining term of the agreement  which aggregate savings is expected to exceed the million cost to exit the supply agreement 
we have already secured an alternative  lower cost source of methylene urea fertilizer from other available market sources with no annual purchase commitments 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  change dollars in millions general and administrative expense general and administrative expense declined by million in to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the cost savings recognized from tightened expense controls  along with the strategic outsourcing of customer financing to gebcs in december  have offset the increase in expense related to more stringent governance guidelines sarbanes oxley section as well as management bonus and employee insurance benefits

business segment results we manage lesco s business utilizing two business segments selling and support 
selling segment we maintain four wall p ls for each of our selling locations service centers  stores on wheels  direct sales representatives and all other direct selling efforts 
these four wall p ls include the sales  cost of sales and operating expenses including payroll  benefits  rent  utilities  freight in bound to selling locations and out bound to customers necessary to operate the individual selling locations 
the selling segment operating results reflect the aggregate four wall p ls of selling locations adjusted for costs of zone and regional management  sales commission expense and the portion of merchant discounts and provision for doubtful accounts not previously charged to the four wall p ls 

table of contents prior to  four wall p ls were not maintained using the current format 
to provide comparable segment results  certain allocations  particularly related to distribution expense  were estimated and reflected for based upon results 
we allocate resources  including working  fixed and leased capital  to existing and potential selling locations based upon projected sales and return on invested capital roic 
we define roic as the percentage calculated by dividing net operating profit after tax nopat by invested capital 
for the selling segment  we calculate roic as follows roic nopat invested capital nopat selling segment operating results x effective tax rate invested capital accounts receivable excluding rebate receivable  see note to consolidated financial statements  plus inventory excluding capitalized distribution and procurement costs  markdown and shrink reserves and credit for inventory held on consignment see note to consolidated financial statements  plus fixed capital see note to consolidated financial statements our measures of roic may not be similar to other similarly titled captions used by other companies

therefore  resources are only allocated to the support segment if the result is a net reduction in expenses or the allocation is necessary for the maintenance of facilities  support of the expansion of selling locations  maintaining the corporate structure or is mandated by law or governmental order

with the sale of the accounts receivable portfolio to gebcs in  we do not expect significant unfavorable changes in our accounts receivable portfolio in the coming periods 
in the future  the working capital items that could result in significant uses of cash are increases in inventory and reductions in accounts payable 
we will merchandise new service centers with  to  of inventory 
as such  we anticipate that inventory levels will increase with the opening of new service centers  but continued improvements in supply chain efficiencies  along with continued accounts payable leverage  could mitigate the impact of incremental product requirements 
accounts payable leverage is summarized as follows for the year ended december  dollars in millions accounts payable less payable to gebcs adjusted accounts payable inventory accounts payable leverage payable to gebcs represents the portion of the receivable portfolio sold to gebcs on december  that remained uncollected by gebcs and secured by the company

table of contents result  lesco had a minimal liability to gebcs at the end of compared to the balance of million 
the accounts payable leverage at the end of was high due to certain year end inventory purchases that remained fully leveraged at december  we believe that an accounts payable leverage ranging from to is sustainable 
interest payments as discussed in the overview  the refinancing and sale of accounts receivable to gebcs significantly changed our debt capital structure  which dramatically reduced our interest expense in we believe that market interest rates will continue to increase during  and we may experience effective rates ranging from to for the year 
we anticipate average revolving credit borrowings of approximately million and a related interest expense of approximately million in income taxes for internal modeling purposes  we utilize a effective income tax rate 
in accordance with gaap requirements  our deferred tax assets at december  and are fully reserved

table of contents lesco generated approximately million in cash from operations during  a portion of which was utilized to repay million of borrowings and invest million in property  plant and equipment 
we believe that the company s financial condition continues to be strong 
together  its cash balances  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets  and borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund short term and long term operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to service center expansion and other projects

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and the disclosures made herein  with the audit committee of the board of directors and its external auditors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the notes to consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of financial condition contain various references and disclosures concerning our accounting policies 
additionally  we have identified each of the following as a critical accounting policy  either because it has the potential to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  because of the significance of the financial item to which it relates  or because it requires judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring at a specific point in time events which will be settled in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when goods are shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
we have consigned inventory agreements on certain products 
we report gross revenue from the sales of consigned inventory in accordance with emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
additionally  we have agency agreements with vendors for which we recognize sales net as an agent 
sales of consigned inventory were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
agency commissions included in net sales were million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from vendors under purchase rebate  cooperative advertising and other contractual programs and trade receivables not financed through outside programs 
the company earns product discounts under various supplier rebate programs  which are recorded as accounts receivable and credited to inventory valuation reserves when earned 
the company provides for expected losses from all owned and recourse accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
expected losses are estimated based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  historical loss experience of the company  historical loss experience of credit portfolios with characteristics similar to the company s portfolio and the current business environment 
inventories inventories are valued principally at the lower of cost average cost method or market 
procurement  warehousing and distribution costs are capitalized to inventory on hand and expensed to distribution cost when the inventory is sold 
vendor rebates earned on purchases are recorded as a reduction to inventory on hand and recognized when the inventory is sold 
we have an inventory life cycle program which requires the classification of all stock keeping units skus into one of five categories active  watch  phase out  discontinued and liquidated 
skus identified as discontinued will be progressively marked down to expected net realizable value over specific periods until the costs are marked down to zero 
at that point  the products are liquidated and purged from the inventory system 
estimated net realizable value of of cost is based on historical sales of discontinued inventory 
at december   a change in net realizable value of current discontinued inventory would affect the reserve by approximately  we maintain a reserve for inventory shrink on a specific location basis  based on historical company wide experience of of sales 
table of contents until the location obtains two physical inventory audits performed by a third party inventory control organization 
the site specific reserve rate is then adjusted to reflect the average shrink rate from the two physical inventory counts 
actual shrink at the time of each physical inventory count is charged against the reserve 
at december   a change in the rate of inventory shrink would have impacted the reserve for shrink by approximately  income taxes the company uses the liability method whereby income taxes are recognized during the fiscal year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial statement income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
in accordance with that standard  the company recorded a million valuation allowance equal to its net deferred tax assets  including amounts related to its net operating loss carryforwards  as of december  the company intends to maintain a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of some portion or the remainder of the allowance 
until such time  the company will have no reported tax provision  net of valuation allowance adjustments 
any future decision to reverse a portion or all of the remaining valuation allowance will be based on consideration of several factors including  but not limited to  the company s expectations regarding future taxable income and the company s cumulative income or loss in the then most recent three year period 
in the event the company was to determine  based on the existence of sufficient positive evidence  that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of the company for additional information regarding income taxes 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets the company assesses the recoverability of its long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the amortization of the remaining balance over its remaining useful life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment exists  the carrying amount of the related asset is reduced to fair value 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption  the company determined that goodwill impairment existed 
the impairment loss was measured by evaluating the fair value of the goodwill using discounted cash flow appraisal models 
these models indicated that the goodwill of million was fully impaired 
upon the adoption of sfas  the company wrote off all of its goodwill recording a million charge  representing the write off of million of goodwill net of a tax benefit of million  as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of january  accrued liabilities certain accrued liabilities  including employee health insurance and workers compensation  are estimated based on historical experience and lag analysis due to the difference between the time the expense is incurred and when the expense is paid 
a valuation analysis is performed to estimate the accrual required for property and casualty insurance claims expense 
accrued environmental costs are estimated based on the company s previous environmental contamination and remediation experience along with site specific conditions
