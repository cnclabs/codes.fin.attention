moore in august results of operations comparison of years ended december  and consolidated the company reported a net loss for of  per share compared to net income of million per share for the sale of honolua ridge residential lots began in july  and contributed million to operating profits for the development segment 
contributions to operating profit from honolua ridge lot sales were largely offset by operating losses from the company s pineapple and resort segments 
consolidated general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased by million in to million from million in the major components of the difference between and were as follows in millions inc dec salaries wages medical insurance professional other outside services employee severance expense employee stock compensation write offs of equipment other assets other net total the reduction in salaries in is primarily due to reductions in force in the pineapple segment 
the decrease in professional services largely reflects expenses incurred in for legal fees and consultant costs related to lawsuits in the pineapple segment  partially offset by increased costs in for outside consultants primarily related to the company s restructuring efforts and new business initiatives 
the pineapple segment lawsuits were settled in the company began stock compensation incentives for certain of its key managers and executives in the fourth quarter of stock compensation expense of million in relates to restricted stock and stock option grants to mr 
cole pursuant to his employment agreement 
the write off of assets relates primarily to the pineapple segment 
in  the company evaluated the fixed assets used in its pineapple operations in an effort to determine the most efficient usage of its assets based on the planned reduction in canned pineapple production  the shift in planting for the fresh fruit market  and changes in agronomic practices 
in september  the company decided to abandon certain assets because they were in excess of the pineapple division s current needs 
some of the assets will be replaced with equipment that is more efficient or more suitable to the company s production and agronomic needs 
in october  the company ceased production of its fresh cut pineapple products and abandoned that product line 
fixed assets  inventory and supplies related to the fresh cut production totaling million were written off in the fourth quarter of general administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the business segment level 
in october  the company began to allocate all corporate general and administrative expenses to its business segments and prior year amounts were restated for comparability 
such allocations are consistent with management s evaluation of the business segments 
consolidated interest expense consolidated interest expense decreased by to million in compared to million in primarily because of lower average borrowings and a higher amount of interest capitalized in in  interest was capitalized on expenditures for construction of the infrastructure improvements for the honolua ridge subdivision 
the company s average interest rates on borrowings were higher in than in pineapple overview the pineapple operating segment includes growing  packing and processing  and marketing of canned and fresh pineapple 
the fruit grown by the company principally consists of three types of pineapple  champaka largely used for canning  hawaiian gold usually sold as fresh  whole fruit and organic pineapple 
in recent years  the company has begun to shift its pineapple operations away from the production of canned products to a higher level of fresh fruit production 
in the fresh fruit business  the period between harvest of the fruit and recognition of revenues is very short as compared to canned sales 
in addition  the sales margins on fresh fruit tend to be higher than on canned products 
effective january  the company hired two new executives with extensive experience in fresh pineapple operations to lead its pineapple operating segment 
it is the company s intention to remain in the canned pineapple business  but to decrease the tonnage of fruit going to the cannery and commensurately reduce the number of market sectors that it is currently serving and the number of types of canned products it produces 
the transition of the company s pineapple operations continues with an emphasis on upgrading production consistency and crop quality to deliver a supply of high quality fresh fruit 
the fresh fruit market is a year round business  which requires consistency of supply 
in  the company began to change its agronomic practices and planting schedules in an effort to begin to produce a more consistent and predictable supply of fruit throughout the year 
in addition  improved crop maintenance and agronomic practices have been implemented in to improve plant yields tons of fruit per acre and the overall quality of the company s pineapple products in future harvests 
in december  the company began to refocus its pineapple business to its core maui operations by selling substantially all of the assets of its costa rican subsidiary 
in october of  the company also reached a strategic decision to cease production of its fresh cut pineapple products and to abandon that product line 
the pineapple segment incurred an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for pineapple segment revenues for decreased by million to million compared to million for the decline in results was partially due to lower sales volumes and higher costs as described further in the paragraphs that follow 
the following non recurring gains reduced the operating loss from continuing operations in and nonrecurring items in december the company received million from the us customs service compared to million from this program in these cash distributions were made pursuant to the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of  or the dumping act  which allows for distribution of antidumping duties to injured domestic producers 
the distributions are recorded as other income in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the dumping act may be repealed and  as a result  the company may not receive any further distributions of the antidumping duties collected by customs 
anti dumping duties have been in effect on canned pineapple fruit imported from thailand since the duties can be increased or decreased annually based on reviews by the us department of commerce that are conducted pursuant to requests by the thai producers or the company 
the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission are scheduled to review the duties in  at which time they will determine whether the duties will continue for the next five year period 
other income for also included non recurring cash receipts of million related to the settlement of certain lawsuits 
legal fees and consultant costs related to these issues were million in discontinued operations in december  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its costa rican pineapple subsidiary with a carrying value of million and recognized a gain from the sale of million after reduction for the minority interest 
the sale closed in december and title to all but two parcels of land was transferred to the buyer 
in  the sale of the remaining two parcels closed resulting in a gain of  after reduction for the minority interest 
the operating results of the costa rican pineapple operations prior to the sale and the gains on the asset sales are reported as discontinued operations and prior period amounts have been restated for comparability 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
canned and fresh pineapple operations the volume of canned pineapple sales decreased by for as compared to  in large part reflecting the company s strategy to sharply reduce supply to selected market segments 
this market refinement has resulted in the average sales prices for the company s canned pineapple products to increase by approximately in compared to the company implemented price increases for its canned product lines in march  june and august increased sales to the us government partially offset the reduction in sales volume to other sectors of the market 
sales to the us government represented approximately of net canned pineapple sales in  compared to approximately in the sale of fresh pineapple represented approximately of net pineapple sales in compared to in the volume of fresh pineapple sales increased by in compared to although the average sales prices for fresh pineapple in were about lower than in  the company s net return after shipping cost on fresh pineapple sales was about higher in reflecting the change in mode of transportation to deliver product see discussion of shipping costs below 
the softness in fresh fruit sales prices in reflect the over supply market conditions in july and august due to precocious fruiting  particularly in costa rica  and highly competitive market conditions during the holiday season 
natural fruit differentiation  more commonly known as precocious fruiting  is a phenomenon experienced in commercial pineapple production 
the effect is that pineapple plants begin to fruit naturally  usually during the summer  rather than under inducement 
during the summer of  precocious fruiting impacted nearly all fresh pineapple growing regions  including maui  thus creating over supply in all markets 
pineapple cost of sales decreased by in compared to primarily because of the reduction in canned pineapple case sales volume 
the company s pineapple inventories are maintained on a last in  first out  or lifo method of accounting 
therefore  in periods of rising prices  current production costs are higher than the average per unit values in inventory 
in  there was a partial liquidation of lifo inventories resulting in lower production costs from prior years being included in cost of sales 
cost of sales would have been higher by million based on production costs 
the average per unit cost of sales is higher in than because of increased costs incurred at the plantations and higher per unit cannery costs 
in  the company increased the total number of acres planted  with emphasis on hawaiian gold and organic pineapple 
in  the company expended approximately million more than twice the average of the prior two years for field preparation  crop maintenance  seed development and other expenditures in order to accomplish the pineapple segment production goals  which were to improve the quality and consistency of its products  improve yields and mitigate the precursor conditions of precocious fruiting 
these costs were included in cost of sales for because  under the company s accounting method  all pineapple production costs incurred at the plantation are charged to the cost of crops harvested for the year 
in addition  higher cost was incurred to harvest because of the precocious fruiting that occurred in the summer of rainfall at the company s pineapple plantations  particularly in the first months of  increased by as much as as compared to the average for the last five years 
this resulted in a delay of the company s pineapple planting schedule and increased costs as the plantations caught up with the planned planting schedules 
pineapple shipping and marketing costs decreased by million in compared to the reduction in these costs is due to the streamlining of canned pineapple sales distribution  resulting in a lower average per unit shipping cost 
the reduction in fresh pineapple shipping costs in versus was due to greater use of surface shipment to the west coast of the united states for the company s fresh pineapple 
in  the company shipped approximately of its hawaiian gold and champaka fresh pineapple by surface rather than by air 
airfreight was used in to mitigate the reduced shelf life of precocious fruit and to avoid the unloading delays at the harbor serving southern california 
in  the company shipped about of its fresh whole pineapple by surface 
the increased use of surface shipment in  which is substantially less costly  was possible partially because of the extended shelf life of the fruit resulting from improved post harvest practices 
the increased use of surface shipment reduced the average per unit fresh fruit shipping cost in by approximately compared to outlook in  the company intends to continue to shift its pineapple production toward the fresh pineapple market with the goals of optimizing the balance of production and sales between the canned and fresh pineapple segments  and producing a high quality and reliable volume of fresh whole pineapples 
the company also intends to conclude the transition of reducing the number of types of canned products and the reduction in market sectors that it serves 
the company expects that in the cost of materials related to fuel sources that it uses to produce  package and ship its products  such as fertilizers  mulch paper  gasoline and freight costs will increase 
the area most affected is expected to be the cost of shipping the company s products to its customers 
this cost is expected to be partially mitigated by increased utilization of ocean freight instead of airfreight 
the company will also be analyzing its costs on a consolidated basis in an attempt to gain purchasing advantages and other procedural changes to lower its costs 
as the company restructures its pineapple operations  and in particular continues its emphasis on the fresh pineapple market  it will incur certain additional costs and expenses 
although not to the same extent as in  the company expects that it will continue to expend additional resources in to improve the quality and reliability of future crops 
because of the long pineapple growing cycle to months for the first crop  the benefit of most of the and expenditures will not be realized until later in through as the company makes greater progress into the fresh pineapple market  it faces the risk of targeted market responses from its competitors 
on february   the company s board of directors approved the expenditure of million for the construction of a multi client processing facility that will replace the company s present pineapple cannery  can plant and fresh fruit packing facility 
the new facility is expected to reduce the company s overall cost structure by integrating the fresh fruit and canning processes and by upgrading much of the current equipment 
construction of the new facility is expected to begin in july and be completed in july of the new facility will be constructed on a portion of the present cannery site in kahului 
the company is evaluating the equipment and the improvements in the present cannery to determine which assets will be incorporated into the new facility and will accelerate depreciation of the assets it expects to abandon

annual contribution to operating profit from the land lease and the kapalua shops was approximately  in and  in the resort also had higher operating and general and administrative expenses in because of costs for deferred maintenance of facilities  expenses incurred to enforce and protect the kapalua trade name  and increased fuel and energy cost 
rainfall at the kapalua resort through the first five months of was up to higher than the average for the prior five years and negatively affected the resort segment s operating results 
golf  merchandise  villas and realty operations revenues from golf operations increased by for compared to the same periods in  as the number of paid rounds of golf and the average green fees each increased by approximately 
promotional programs in to increase golf play and villa occupancies reduced the average green fees for most of increased revenues from the golf operations were partially offset by new union contracts for the golf maintenance employees as of june and for the golf services employees as of march merchandise sales increased by in compared to due primarily to the increased number of visitors to kapalua and to additional retail floor space with the opening of the kapalua collections store at the end of the first quarter of revenues from the kapalua villas increased by in compared to  primarily reflecting increased occupancies 
the average daily room rates in were about lower than occupancy at the kapalua villas increased by approximately nine percentage points in compared to contribution to operating profit from the villas was approximately  lower in compared to lower results from the villas operations were largely due to maintenance and other expenditures to upgrade and improve the facilities and the level of service provided by the kapalua villas

in the second quarter of  the resort will close the plantation golf course for approximately months for a comprehensive regrassing of the greens  renovation of the fairway bunkers and other course improvements 
this  as well as the closure of the bay club and bay course restaurants  is expected to negatively impact the resort s financial results 
the company will be aggressively promoting play on the bay course and the village course to make up for some of the shortfall in plantation course rounds and has developed a plan of activities and a marketing program designed to try to mitigate the effect of the plantation course closure 
the bay course clubhouse restaurant is expected to reopen in the second quarter of and the bay club is expected to reopen at the end of as mentioned above  the company has put into place the kapalua gold program to work with the villa owners to upgrade their units to new premium standards
