item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through the continued development of our core businesses and carefully selected acquisitions 
we fueled our acquisition growth during primarily by the third quarter acquisition of hudson respiratory care inc  or hudsonrci  a leading provider of disposable medical products for respiratory care and anesthesia 
we continue to integrate hudsonrci s operations into our existing medical business 
during our results also were affected by the full year contribution from acquisitions of seven smaller businesses a cardiothoracic devices business  reported in our medical segment  an anesthesia and respiratory care business  reported in our medical segment  a designer and manufacturer of electronic and electromechanical products for the automotive marine and industrial markets  reported in our commercial segment  a european manufacturer of alternative fuel systems  reported in our commercial segment  a european light duty cable operation  reported in our commercial segment  a passenger and light truck electronic throttle control business  reported in our commercial segment  and an automotive seat comfort system business  reported in our commercial segment 
our internal growth initiatives include the development of new products  moving existing products into market adjacencies in which we already participate with other products and the expansion of market share 
our core revenue growth in as compared to  excluding the impacts of currency  acquisitions and divestitures  was 
in connection with the acquisition of hudsonrci  we retired certain existing credit lines  issued million of senior notes at fixed interest rates ranging from to  entered into a million five year revolving credit facility and amended the terms of certain existing senior notes to create a more effective and lower rate debt structure 
in  we commenced a portfolio evaluation to identify businesses for divestiture  phase out or consolidation 
we have engaged an investment banking firm to assist us in this process and to evaluate strategic alternatives for a major portion of the businesses that were identified as non strategic in our evaluation process 
as a result of the initial evaluations we completed the divestiture of six small  non strategic businesses during the year four in the commercial segment  one in the medical segment and one in the aerospace segment 
these divestitures resulted in an aggregate pre tax gain of million 
on november   we announced the initiation of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for earnings growth in the years ahead 
the planned actions include exiting or divesting of non core or underperforming businesses  consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services 
in connection with the restructuring and divestiture program we announced plans to actively market and divest the automotive pedal systems business 
for and comparable periods  the automotive pedal systems business has been presented in our consolidated financial results as a discontinued operation 
we also announced plans to substantially exit the aftermarket services portion of the industrial gas turbine product line reported in our aerospace segment 
in addition  we began a program to consolidate manufacturing facilities and continue to consolidate administrative functions to create shared services and further standardization of processes across the company 
restructuring costs were million in  of which was commercial  medical and aerospace 
all inventory adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during the fourth quarter of are included in materials  labor and other product costs and totaled million in  of which million  and million was attributed to our commercial  medical and aerospace segments  respectively 
the weakening of the us dollar through and  particularly against the euro  the swedish krona  the canadian dollar and the british pound  had mixed impact on our reported results 
currency changes increased reported net revenues and net orders by million and million  respectively  in  as compared to during  we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
as a result  we consolidated four small entities which had previously not been consolidated 
these entities are reported in our medical and commercial segments 
we also determined that it is appropriate to separately identify and reclassify for all periods presented minority interest and minority interest in equity for all of our consolidated  but not wholly owned  subsidiaries 
the minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries previously included within selling  engineering and administrative expenses totaled  and  for and  respectively 
the minority interest in equity of consolidated affiliates previously included within other liabilities totaled  for these reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income or equity 
during the fourth quarter of  we eliminated the one month lag for certain of our foreign operations to coincide with the timing of reporting for all of our other operations 
as a result  our consolidated results for include the results of those operations for the month of december and the entire twelve months of  whereas our consolidated results for include the results of those operations for the month of december and the first eleven months of this change increased our consolidated revenues for by  and reduced our consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest for by  critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market 
inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates 
based upon these judgments and estimates  we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
accounting for long lived assets the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on the existing business 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill 
in addition  we test our other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of future performance  long term discount notes and market price valuation multiples 
these estimates will likely change over time 
many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality 
goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for restructuring costs restructuring costs  which include termination benefits  contract termination costs  asset impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value 
key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the anticipated sales price for discontinued operations  the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual obligations  the realizable value of certain assets associated with discontinued product lines and the timing of employees leaving the company 
the estimated total cost of the restructuring and divestiture actions which commenced in november is anticipated to be between million and million 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is doubtful 
the allowance is based on our historical experience  the period an account is outstand ing  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
we review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
product warranty liability most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales 
we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold  recourse provisions against third parties  the status of existing claims  recall programs and communication with customers 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for income taxes income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items 
we estimate the likelihood of these actions and provide appropriate tax liabilities 
our income taxes payable was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
results of operations discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition 
activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth 
core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year  the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelve month period 
the following comparisons exclude the impact of the automotive pedal systems business  which has been presented in our consolidated financial results as a discontinued operation 
comparison of and revenues increased in to billion from billion in this increase was due to increases of from core growth  from acquisitions  net of dispositions  from currency and from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations 
the commercial  medical and aerospace segments comprised  and of our revenues  respectively 
materials  labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to in compared to in the decline was due to the disposition of underperforming businesses and a favorable contribution from the hudsonrci acquisition 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared with in due to increases relative to sales in the commercial and aerospace segments and higher corporate expenses which were impacted by the costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and costs associated with the resolution of a number of legal matters 
in  we sold an investment  resulting in a pre tax gain of million  or per share after tax 
in  we sold six non strategic businesses  resulting in a net pre tax gain of million  or per share after tax 
interest expense increased in principally from higher debt outstanding in connection with the hudsonrci acquisition  net of repayments and lower borrowing costs 
the effective income tax rate was in compared with in the lower rate in was primarily the result of the benefit associated with the restructuring and divestiture program 
net income for was million  a decrease of from diluted net earnings per share decreased to  and includes the cost of restructuring and discontinued operations 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased million in due to increased profits from our joint ventures 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced and commenced implementation of our restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for earnings growth in the years ahead 
the planned actions include exiting or divesting of non core or low performing businesses  consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services 
certain costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture program are not included in restructuring costs 
all inventory adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during the fourth quarter of are included in materials  labor and other product costs and totaled million  of which million  and million was attributed to our commercial  medical and aerospace segments  respectively 
for  the charges associated with the restructuring and divestiture program by segment that are included in restructuring costs were as follows commercial medical aerospace total dollars in thousands termination benefits contract termination costs asset impairments other restructuring costs termination benefits are comprised of severance related payments for all employees terminated in connection with the restructuring and divestiture program 
contract termination costs relate primarily to the termination of leases in conjunction with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities 
asset impairments relate primarily to machinery and equipment associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities as well as goodwill associated with our industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business 
other restructuring costs include expenses which are directly attributable to the restructuring and divestiture program 
as of december   we expect to incur the following future restructuring costs in our commercial  medical and aerospace segments over the next quarters commercial medical aerospace dollars in thousands termination benefits contract termination costs other restructuring costs comparison of and revenues increased in to billion from billion resulting from gains in the commercial and medical segments  which offset a decline in the aerospace segment 
acquisitions  net of dispositions  accounted for one half of our increase in revenue 
the impact of currency exchange rates provided the remainder of the revenue increase 
overall core growth was down slightly 
sales from international operations  which represented of our revenues  increased in of which resulted from stronger foreign currency and from acquisitions 
the commercial  medical and aerospace segments accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
materials  labor and other product costs were of revenues  consistent with operating expenses increased to of revenues in compared with in due to increases in the medical segment  and to a lesser extent the commercial and aerospace segments 
in  we sold an investment which resulted in a pretax gain of million  or per share after tax 
in  we sold two minor non core businesses and also received insurance proceeds resulting in an aggregate million gain  or per share after tax 
interest expense increased in by million  largely a result of currency movement during the year 
as a percent of revenues  interest expense decreased to compared to in the effective income tax rate decreased to in from in net income in decreased to million from million 
diluted earnings per share decreased from in to per share in minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased million in due primarily to an increase in the medical segment 
we closed or severely curtailed operations at facilities in costs related to these consolidation efforts were million  of which was commercial  medical and aerospace 
these costs were incurred throughout the year 
segment reviews the following is a discussion of our segment operating results 
additional information regarding our segments is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
commercial products in the commercial segment generally are produced in higher unit volume than those of our other two segments 
they are manufactured for broad distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual customer needs 
consumer spending patterns influence the market trends for products sold to the automotive and marine markets 
automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily for automotive oems 
discussion of marine and industrial product lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of driver controls  motion controls  power and vehicle management systems and fuel management systems to the automotive supply  marine and industrial markets 
comparison of and commercial segment revenues increased in to billion from billion in the improvement was due to increases of from core growth  from currency and from acquisitions  offset  in part  by a decrease from dispositions 
revenue from driver control products sold to oem s increased slightly in compared to  with increases from currency and core growth mostly offset by a decrease from a disposition 
for the remainder of the segment  three fourths of the revenue improvements were the result of core gains 
favorable currency translation provided a majority of the remaining growth and revenues from acquired entities were equivalent to the impact of dispositions 
commercial segment operating profit declined in to million from million in marine and industrial operating profit improved on volume gains which were partially offset by a cancellation of automotive alternative fuel programs in north america  pricing pressure in the automotive supplier market and costs related to a new product launch 
operating profit in the automotive cables and shifters product line declined as a result of pricing pressure and increased raw material costs 
operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in assets in the commercial segment increased million  as currency and receivable increases in european automotive cable and shifter and united states light duty cables were tempered by the impact of business dispositions 
comparison of and commercial segment revenues increased to billion in from million in acquisitions and currency translation each added 
in automotive cables and shifters  favorable currency movements accounted for over of the overall improvement as core gains in europe and asia were tempered by a decline in north america 
core growth outside the united states was largely the result of increased shifter and guide control products 
in the marine and industrial product lines  revenue increased as a result of acquisitions  including businesses in the power and vehicle management systems and motion controls businesses 
acquisitions accounted for nearly three fourths of the improvement and currency provided the remainder 
core revenue was relatively constant as declines in the marine aftermarket  primarily fishfinders  and alternative fuel systems were offset by increased sales to truck  military and automotive supply markets 
commercial segment operating profit increased in to million from million due to improvement in the automotive cable and shifter product line 
automotive cables and shifters operating profit improved as the result of higher volume from new products and cost reductions which served to more than offset the impact of customer price reductions 
marine and industrial operating profit was flat as acquisitions compensated for a core business decline 
core business declined due to adverse mix as lower margin marine and truck products replaced higher margin aftermarket products 
in addition  alternative fuel systems declined as a result of lower volume in part related to delays in the passage of the energy bill 
assets in this segment increased million  of the increase resulted from acquisitions in the marine and industrial product lines  and from the impact of currency exchange rates 
medical products in the medical segment generally are required to meet exacting standards of performance and have long product life cycles 
economic influences on revenues relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital supply market 
comparison of and medical segment revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from acquisitions  from core growth  from currency  from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations and from the consolidation of variable interest entities 
in disposable medical products  of the growth came from the hudsonrci acquisition with currency and core improvement providing a majority of the remaining increase 
in surgical instruments and medical devices  the cardiothoracic acquisition in the third quarter of accounted for over two thirds of the year over year revenue improvement 
medical segment operating profit increased in to million from million in this increase was driven largely by acquisitions and core volume gains in both the disposable medical products and surgical instruments and medical devices product lines 
operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in assets in the medical segment increased million or primarily due to the hudsonrci acquisition 
comparison of and in  medical segment revenues increased to million from million 
revenues gained from acquisitions and from the effects of stronger currencies while core growth remained relatively constant 
in the disposable medical products product line  two thirds of the revenue increase came from stronger foreign currencies 
sales in the surgical instruments and medical devices product line improved substantially due to acquisitions including a cardiothoracic devices business in operating profit increased in to million compared with million in the increase in operating profit was comprised of equal contributions from disposable medical products volume and currency and acquisitions in the surgical instruments and medical devices product line 
overall operating profit as a percent of revenues declined as an improvement in the disposable medical products product line from volume gains was more than offset by a decline in surgical instruments and medical devices  as a result of the acquisition 
assets increased million or 
the cardiothoracic devices acquisition accounted for of the increase 
aerospace products and services in the aerospace segment  many of which are proprietary  require a high degree of engineering sophistication and are often custom designed 
economic influences on these products and services relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and to demand for power generation 
comparison of and aerospace segment revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from currency and from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations  offset  in part  by a decrease from dispositions 
core growth was the result of double digit growth in repair products and services and precision machined components  which more than compensated for declines in industrial gas turbine  or igt and cargo handling systems 
core revenue growth was in part due to increased sales of lower margin offerings 
aerospace segment operating profit declined in to a loss of million from a profit of million in operating profit declined due primarily to one time charges in igt related to our restructuring and divestiture program  pricing pressures from the aerospace oems and aftermarket and higher costs in precision machined components 
operating profit loss as a percent of revenues was in versus in assets in the aerospace segment declined million or due substantially to the phase out of the igt business 
comparison of and in aerospace segment revenues decreased to million from million in core products declined by while currency contributed a positive 
sales declined due to weaker end markets in the igt product line and to a lesser extent the cargo handling systems and precision machined components product lines 
these declines were tempered by an increase in repair products and services revenues brought about by higher sales of low margin material product offerings 
operating profit declined from million in to million in  while operating profit as a percent of revenues fell to from in the prior year 
a significant portion of the decline was attributable to the igt product line which declined due to lower volume  major investments in new parts development  and contract losses in the engineering services business 
results in cargo handling systems and precision machined components were adversely impacted by volume declines and continued pricing pressures 
margins of repair products and services declined due to the unfavorable product mix 
in  assets increased million or due substantially to currency fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided net cash of approximately million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
the most significant changes were an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories  offset  in part  by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to increased accruals associated with the restructuring and divestiture program 
the decrease in inventories was the result of our focus on improved working capital management 
the increase in accounts receivable was largely a result of increased business levels and the hudsonrci acquisition 
the decrease in income taxes payable was a result of tax deductions associated with the restructuring and divestiture program  for which the cash benefits will be received in our financing activities during consisted primarily of the receipt of million in gross proceeds from long term borrowings  primarily for the acquisition of hudsonrci 
this amount is offset by a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of million and a reduction in long term borrowings of million  driven by improved operating cash flow  proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower year over year capital spending 
our investing activities during consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of million 
we had net cash used in discontinued operations of million in see the interest rate risk section of item a on page for additional information regarding interest rates and borrowings 
operating activities provided net cash of approximately million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
the most significant change was an increase in accounts receivable  offset  in part  by an increase in income taxes payable 
accounts receivable growth was in line with volume improvement as accounts receivable as a percentage of fourth quarter revenues remained flat 
our financing activities during consisted primarily of a reduction in long term borrowings of million  offset  in part  by an increase in notes payable and current borrowings of million 
during  we also paid million in dividends 
our investing activities during consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of million and capital expenditures of million 
we had net cash used in discontinued operations of million in operating activities provided net cash of approximately million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
the most significant change was an increase in inventory  offset  in part  by an increase in income taxes payable 
inventory increased in connection with new wide body cargo handling systems  repair products and services programs and igt aftermarket parts products 
our financing activities during consisted primarily of reductions of million in notes payable and current borrowings and million in long term borrowings  offset  in part  by the receipt of million in gross proceeds from long term borrowings 
during  we also paid million in dividends 
our investing activities during consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million and payments for businesses acquired of million 
we had net cash used in discontinued operations of million in in addition to the cash generated from operations we have approximately million in committed and million in uncommitted unused lines of credit available 
the availability of the lines of credit is dependent upon us maintaining our strong financial condition including our continued compliance with bank covenants 
various senior note agreements provide for the maintenance of ratios and limit the payment of cash dividends 
under the most restrictive of these provisions  million of retained earnings was available for dividends at december  fixed rate borrowings comprised of total borrowings at december  approximately of our total borrowings of million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  providing a natural hedge against fluctuations in the value of assets outside the united states 
the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio dollars in thousands net debt includes current borrowings long term borrowings total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt total capital includes net debt shareholders equity total capital percent of net debt to total capital the increase in our percent of net debt to total capital for as compared to is primarily due to additional borrowings used to acquire hudsonrci 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures and additional acquisition opportunities 
contractual obligations at december  are as follows payments due by period less more than than total year years years years dollars in millions long term borrowings interest obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for plant and equipment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately million
