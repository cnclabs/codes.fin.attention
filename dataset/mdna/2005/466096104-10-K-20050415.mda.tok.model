item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview j 
alexander s corporation the company owns and operates high volume  upscale casual dining restaurants which offer a contemporary american menu 
at january   the company owned and operated j 
alexander s restaurants in states 
j 
alexander s restaurants compete in the restaurant industry by placing special emphasis on high food quality and high levels of professional service offered in an attractive environment 
j 
alexander s typically does no advertising and relies on each restaurant to increase sales through building its reputation as an outstanding dining establishment 
the company has generally been successful in achieving same store sales increases over time using this strategy 
management was generally pleased with the company s performance for the fiscal year 
the company achieved what management considers to be excellent improvement in weekly average same store sales per restaurant of for the year by maintaining guest counts while increasing menu prices by approximately in response to record high levels of input costs in several major food cost categories 
increases in food input costs continued to be a significant issue faced by the company  as cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to in from in  even though the company increased menu prices as indicated 
this follows an increase of 
in the cost of sales percentage in over a large portion of the cost of sales increase was due to increases in the company s cost of beef  which increased further in march of in order to offset at least a portion of the cost of sales increases it is experiencing  in april of the company increased prices for selected menu items and changed its menu pricing format to modified la carte pricing for beef and seafood entrees 
under the modified la carte format  menu prices of beef and seafood entrees which previously included a dinner salad decreased by to in many locations although increasing in certain major market locations  but no longer include a salad 
if desired  a salad can now be added for an additional charge of 
management believes these changes will reduce the company s cost of sales as a percentage of sales and that same store sales should continue to increase in as a result of the effect of menu price increases and continued excellence in restaurant operations 
however  average guest counts per restaurant on a same store basis declined by approximately during the last half of and the first quarter of compared to the corresponding prior year periods  and there can be no assurance that further guest count losses will not be experienced as a result of the increased menu prices or other factors  and that same store sales could be negatively affected 
the opening of new restaurants by the company can and does have a significant impact on the company s financial performance 
because pre opening costs for new restaurants are significant and most new restaurants incur start up losses during their early months of operation  the number of restaurants opened in a particular year can have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
sales at the company s two newest restaurants opened in the fourth quarter of have not met management s expectations to date and both of these restaurants continued to experience operating losses in management believes that over time sales and operating profits in these restaurants will increase to more acceptable levels  as has generally been the case with certain of the company s other restaurants 

table of contents because large capital investments are required for j 
alexander s restaurants and because a significant portion of labor costs and other operating expenses are fixed or semi fixed in nature  the sales required for an individual restaurant to break even are high compared to many other casual dining concepts and it is necessary for the company to achieve relatively high sales volumes in its restaurants in order to achieve desired financial returns 
the company s criteria for new restaurant development target locations with high population densities and high household incomes which management believes provide the best prospects for achieving outstanding financial returns on the company s investments in new restaurants 
management intends to maintain a conservative new restaurant development rate of generally one to two new restaurants per year to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants  while maintaining its pursuit of operational excellence 
the company currently plans to open one new restaurant in summary of results during fiscal  the company posted income before income taxes of  up from  reported during operating income for also improved by over  compared to the previous year 
these improvements were achieved in part because of pre opening expenses and non cash compensation expense which were included in the results  with virtually no corresponding expenses incurred in also reflected in the results are the benefit of an extra week included in the fiscal year  a non recurring property gain of  and operating losses incurred in in the company s two newest restaurants opened in the fourth quarter of net income increased to  in from  in the results included a favorable adjustment of  to the income tax provision for the year as a result of a reduction of the company s valuation allowance recorded against its deferred income tax assets

fiscal contained weeks compared to weeks in both and restaurants open at end of year weighted average weekly sales per restaurant net sales net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in the million of net sales recorded in represented an increase of million  or  over million of sales reported in the sales increase in was due to increases in net sales in the same store restaurant base and to additional restaurant weeks during because of the opening of three restaurants during and an additional week included in the fiscal year 
management estimates that the rd week included in the fiscal year increased sales by approximately  the sales increase in was primarily due to three new restaurants which opened during the year and to sales increases within the company s same store base 
average weekly same store sales per restaurant increased by to  per week in from  per week in on a base of restaurants 
same store sales averaged  per restaurant per week in  an increase of from on a base of restaurants 
the company computes weighted average weekly sales per restaurant by dividing total restaurant sales for the period by the total number of days all restaurants were open for the period to obtain a daily sales average  with the daily sales average then multiplied by seven to arrive at weekly average sales per restaurant 
days on which restaurants are closed for business for any reason other than the scheduled closure of all j 
alexander s restaurants on thanksgiving day and christmas day are excluded from this calculation 
weighted average weekly same store sales per restaurant are 
table of contents computed in the same manner as described above except that sales and sales days used in the calculation include only those for restaurants open for more than months 
management believes that same store sales and guest count trends are important measures of comparative performance in the restaurant industry and for the company 
included in the same store sales increases above were estimated guest count increases of approximately 
in and in after experiencing declining guest counts in the first three quarters of  the company s guest counts flattened in the fourth quarter of and increased on a comparative basis each quarter in and for the first two quarters of management believes the increases in and the first half of were due to improved service levels in the company s restaurants  limited menu price increases during and  and improvements in operations in certain of the company s restaurants located in small and mid sized markets 
increased wine sales  which management believes are due to additional emphasis placed on the company s wine feature program  and special menu features also contributed to same store sales increases in and management estimates that guest counts on a same store basis declined by approximately in the last half of compared to the last half of primarily because of higher menu prices 
management estimates the average check per guest  excluding alcoholic beverage sales  was for  compared to in and in menu prices for increased by an estimated compared to no significant increases were made in management believes its long term emphasis on providing professional service combined with effective menu management will continue to build sales and increase guest traffic over time 
average weekly same store sales increased by approximately for the first quarter of compared to the same period of restaurant costs and expenses total restaurant operating expenses increased to of sales in from in total restaurant operating expenses were of net sales in the increase in was due primarily to the impact of higher cost of sales and to the effect of higher operating expense percentages experienced in the company s two newest restaurants opened in the last quarter of  with lower labor costs and depreciation and amortization charges partially offsetting the effect of these increases 
the decrease in compared to was due to decreases in all restaurant operating expense categories  with the exception of cost of sales 
restaurant operating margins net sales minus total restaurant operating expenses  divided by net sales decreased to in from in  which was up from in cost of sales  which includes the cost of food and beverages  increased to of sales in from in  as the effect of menu price increases did not offset  as a percentage of net sales  significantly higher input costs associated with beef  pork  poultry  dairy products and other food commodities during the year 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased by 
in compared to due primarily to increases in input costs in a number of categories including poultry  produce and dairy 
the company s cost of salmon also increased in as did the cost of shortening and cooking oil 
beef costs increased in due to the effect of upgrading selected beef products to higher quality and more expensive certified angus beef  and the company also experienced a shift toward more sales of beef products  which generally have a higher cost of sales 
beef purchases represent the largest component of the company s cost of sales  comprising approximately of this category 
the company typically enters into an annual pricing agreement covering most of its beef purchases 
due to high prices in the beef market during and early  prices under the company s beef pricing agreement which was effective in march of increased by an estimated to for the twelve month term of that agreement 
in response to the higher beef input costs as well as continuing upward pressure on the cost of a number of other food items  the company increased menu prices by approximately in march of and by lesser amounts several times throughout the remainder of the year 
beef prices under the company s most recent beef pricing agreement which is effective at the end of march of will increase by an estimated additional to over those under the previous agreement 
a portion of the increase under the new pricing agreement is due to the company upgrading its beef program to serve only certified angus beef in all of its restaurants 
restaurant labor and related costs decreased to of net sales in from of net sales during because of the nature of j 
alexander s operations and the company s emphasis on providing high quality food and outstanding levels of service  much of the labor scheduled for overseeing restaurant operations  for preparing food  and for staffing the service areas of the restaurants is relatively fixed in nature within broad ranges of sales for each restaurant 
as a result  increases in net sales in the same store restaurant base in did not result in proportionate increases in labor costs and labor costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 
the effect of these decreases more than offset high labor costs in newer restaurants 
a decrease in group medical costs resulting from changes to the company s group medical plan also contributed to the decrease 
restaurant labor and related costs decreased to of net sales 
table of contents in from in due largely to the effect of higher tip share contributions by restaurant servers to each restaurant s tip pool  which resulted in reductions in the hourly wage rates paid by the company to the employees receiving larger distributions under the tip pool program 
the favorable effects of the higher tip share contributions combined with labor efficiencies gained at higher sales volumes as described above more than offset the effects of higher labor costs in new restaurants and increases in workers compensation insurance premiums 
depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment as a percentage of net sales decreased to for from for primarily due to the effect of higher same store sales volumes which more than offset the effect of higher depreciation expense on the new  lower volume locations opened in the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment decreased to of sales in from in due primarily to assets which became fully depreciated 
other operating expenses  which include restaurant level expenses such as china and supplies  laundry and linen costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities  credit card fees  rent  property taxes and insurance  increased to of net sales during from of net sales in this increase was primarily related to increases in rent and other expenses associated with restaurants opened by the company in higher credit card fees  repairs and maintenance expenditures  losses on disposal of restaurant property and equipment and laundry and linen costs also contributed to the increase 
other operating expenses decreased to of net sales in from in primarily because of operating efficiencies gained at higher sales volumes and management s emphasis on controlling costs in this area 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include all supervisory costs and expenses  management training and relocation costs  and other costs incurred above the restaurant level  totaled  in   in and  in the most significant factors contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  were higher salary expenses  including salaries for additional operations supervisory personnel added in connection with the company s growth  and higher accruals for bonuses to be paid to the corporate staff based on performance 
increases in other personnel related costs as well as higher corporate governance and american stock exchange compliance related expenses also contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in non cash compensation expense reported in connection with a variable stock option award  which is further discussed below  and a reduction in severance costs compared to when costs related to the separation from the company of one of its corporate officers were recognized 
the most significant factors contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses in when compared to were the inclusion of non cash compensation expense of  related to a stock option grant accounted for as a variable stock option award  increases in group health insurance costs and higher travel expenses resulting from the opening of three new restaurants 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in the accrual for bonuses paid to the corporate staff for the year and a reduction in salary expenses 
general and administrative expenses included non cash compensation expense of  and  in and  respectively  in connection with a stock option grant accounted for as a variable plan award 
the exercise price of this option grant was fixed by the company s board of directors in may of and  as a result  the company will not recognize any additional compensation expense with respect to the grant 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in and  compared in each case to the previous year  due to growth of the company s sales base 
pre opening expense pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
no pre opening expenses were incurred for because no new restaurants were opened or under development 
pre opening costs totaled  in due to the opening of three new restaurants in that year 
no new restaurants were opened in other income expense net interest expense did not change significantly in compared to net interest expense increased by  in compared to due to increased borrowings and to higher interest rates associated with  of mortgage financing completed by the company during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at january  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at january  include  of tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent principally on future earnings of the company and the recognition of these assets depends on the company s assessment of the likelihood of having taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets have been reduced through use of a valuation allowance to the extent future income is not considered more likely than not to be generated in such amounts 
based on management s assessment of the likelihood of the future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by   and  in the fourth quarters of  and  respectively  with corresponding credits to the income tax provisions for those years 
these credits  while reducing income tax expense  are not a current source of cash for the company 
see additional discussion under critical accounting policies income taxes 
in april  the internal revenue service completed an examination of the company s federal income tax returns for fiscal years through adjustments related to this examination did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
during  the company reversed previously accrued federal income taxes payable of  resulting in a reduction in the current federal provision 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital needs are primarily for the development and construction of new j 
alexander s restaurants  for maintenance of its existing restaurants  and for meeting debt service obligations 
the company has met these needs and maintained liquidity for the past three years primarily by use of cash flow from operations  use of bank lines of credit  and through proceeds received in from a mortgage loan 
cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately million at the end of primarily because cash flow from operations  which included receipt of a landlord tenant improvement allowance of approximately  for a restaurant opened in the fourth quarter of  exceeded capital expenditures for the year 
during  the company also received proceeds of approximately  as a result of the involuntary conversion of a portion of the property on which one of the company s restaurants is located 
the company s capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year depending on the number  timing and form of ownership of new restaurants 
cash expenditures for capital assets totaled   and  for  and  respectively 
a significant portion of the capital expenditures for and was for new restaurant development  whereas the expenditures were primarily for remodels  enhancements and asset replacements related to existing restaurants 
cash provided by operating activities exceeded capital expenditures in and and represented of capital expenditures for the remaining capital expenditures for were funded primarily by use of a portion of the proceeds from long term mortgage financing completed in october of a bank line of credit was used to meet certain obligations  including annual sinking fund requirements for a convertible debenture issue which was retired in  and working capital needs during a portion of in october  the company obtained  of long term financing through completion of a mortgage loan transaction 
the mortgage loan has an effective annual interest rate  including the effect of the amortization of deferred issue costs  of and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  over a period of years through november net proceeds from the mortgage loan  after deducting fees and expenses associated with the transaction  were approximately  a portion of these funds were used to pay off the outstanding balance of  on the company s bank line of credit as of october   terminating that facility 
remaining funds were invested in short term money market funds and used along with cash flow from operations primarily for retiring the company s  of convertible subordinated debentures which matured in  to fund capital costs associated with new and existing restaurants  and for repurchases of the company s common stock 

table of contents provisions of the mortgage loan and related agreements require that a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to be maintained for the businesses operated at the properties included under the mortgage and that a funded debt to ebitda as defined in the loan agreement ratio of to be maintained for the company and its subsidiaries 
the company was in compliance with all such provisions at both january  and december  the loan is pre payable without penalty after october   with a yield maintenance penalty in effect prior to that time 
the mortgage loan is secured by the real estate  equipment and other personal property of nine of the company s restaurant locations with an aggregate book value of  at january  the real property at these locations is owned by jax real estate  llc  the borrower under the loan agreement  which leases them to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company as lessee 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of the lessee subsidiary to pay rents under the lease 
jax real estate  llc  is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company which is included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  jax real estate  llc was established as a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity and maintains its own legal existence  ownership of its assets and responsibility for its liabilities separate from the company and its other affiliates 
in may of  the company entered into a secured bank line of credit agreement which provides up to  for financing capital expenditures related to the development of new restaurants and for general operating purposes 
credit available under the line is currently approximately million and is based on a percentage of the appraised value of the collateral securing the line 
provisions of the line of credit agreement require that the company maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to and a maximum adjusted debt to ebitdar as defined in the loan agreement ratio of to the company was in compliance with all such provisions at both january  and december  the bank loan agreement also provides that defaults which permit acceleration of debt under other loan agreements constitute a default under the bank agreement 
the company s ability to incur additional debt outside of the line of credit is also restricted 
the line of credit is secured by the real estate of two of the company s restaurant locations with an aggregate book value of  at january  and bears interest on outstanding borrowings at the rate of libor plus a spread of two to four percent  depending on the company s leverage ratio 
the credit line expires on april   unless converted to a term loan prior to march  under the provisions of the agreement 
borrowings outstanding under this credit line were  at december  there were no borrowings under the line from january  through march  management believes cash and cash equivalents on hand at january  combined with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet its financing needs for and that its long term growth plan of one to two restaurants per year will not be constrained due to lack of capital resources 
however  to supplement its other sources of capital and provide additional funds for future growth  the company completed  of five year equipment financing in january management believes that  if needed  additional financing would be available for future growth through an increase in bank credit  additional mortgage or equipment financing  or sale and leaseback of some or all of the company s unencumbered restaurant properties 
there can be no assurance  however  that  if needed  such financing could be obtained or that it would be on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company currently plans to open one new restaurant in and management estimates that capital expenditures for the year will be approximately million 
however  management is continually seeking locations for new j 
alexander s restaurants and would consider quickly taking advantage of any attractive opportunities which might arise 
capital expenditures in for the development of any new restaurants in addition to the restaurant currently planned are dependent upon the timing and success of management s efforts to locate acceptable sites and would be in addition to the estimate above 
the company has periodically made purchases of its common stock under a repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors 
the total authorized purchases under this program are  from june through may   the company repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately  an average cost of per share 
the company generally does not repurchase shares following the end of a fiscal quarter until after results for the quarter have been publicly announced 
while the company at times operates with a working capital deficit  management does not believe such deficits impair the overall financial condition of the company 
many companies in the restaurant industry operate with a working capital deficit because guests pay for their purchases with cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale while trade payables for food and beverage purchases and other obligations related to restaurant operations are not typically due for some time after the sale takes place 
since requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 

table of contents the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of its debt agreements as of january  should the company fail to comply with these covenants  management would likely request waivers of the covenants  attempt to renegotiate them or seek other sources of financing 
however  if these efforts were not successful  amounts outstanding under these credit facilities could become immediately due and payable  and there could be a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
as of april   the company had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated affiliated entities or related parties 
additionally  the company is not a party to any financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
operating lease commitments for leased restaurants and office space are disclosed in note e  leases and note j  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth significant contractual obligations of the company at january  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capitalized lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations total long term debt and capitalized lease obligations include the interest expense component 
excludes renewal option periods 
in determining purchase obligations for this table  the company used its interpretation of the definition set forth in the related rule which states  a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
in applying this definition  the company has only included purchase obligations to the extent the failure to perform would result in formal recourse to j 
alexander s corporation 
from through  the company operated restaurants in the quick service restaurant industry 
the discontinuation of these quick service restaurant operations included disposals of restaurants that were subject to lease agreements which typically contained initial lease terms of years plus two additional option periods of five years each 
in connection with certain of these dispositions  the company remains secondarily liable for ensuring financial performance as set forth in the original lease agreements 
the company can only estimate its contingent liability relative to these leases  as any changes to the contractual arrangements between the current tenant and the landlord subsequent to the assignment are not required to be disclosed to the company 
a summary of the company s estimated contingent liability as of january   is as follows wendy s restaurants leases mrs 
winner s chicken biscuits restaurants leases total contingent liability related to assigned leases there have been no payments by the company of such contingent liabilities in the history of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its accounting for income taxes  
table of contents property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those which involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company had  of gross deferred tax assets at january   consisting principally of  of tax credit carryforwards 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the company record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will ultimately be realized 
due to losses incurred by the company from through and because a significant portion of the company s costs are fixed or semi fixed in nature  management was unable to conclude from through that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized  therefore  the company maintained a valuation allowance for of its deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  for those years 
in  the company completed its third consecutive profitable year  with pre tax income increasing significantly over the previous year 
in addition the company had recorded significant increases in operating income in four of the five years from through and had reached a size and experience level which management believed made it less likely that an unsuccessful new restaurant would have a significant effect on consolidated operating results 
because of these factors  management further assessed the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets  using as its principal basis its forecast of future taxable income for the following two years adjusted by applying varying probability factors to the achievement of this forecast 
as the result of this assessment  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by  in the fourth quarter of  with a corresponding credit to deferred income tax expense 
in  after completing a second year of pretax income in excess of  management performed a similar analysis but extended its outlook for the following three years and determined that an additional  of deferred tax assets were more likely than not going to be realized 
as a result of this analysis  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by  in the fourth quarter of  with a corresponding credit to deferred income tax expense 
in performing its evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets in  management gave consideration to the higher level of pre tax income achieved in as compared to recent years and to the fact that the company has been profitable for the five fiscal years through based on these historical results and on its assessment of the company s expected future profitability adjusted by varying probability factors  management concluded that a valuation allowance is currently needed only for federal alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards of  and for  of tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards  the use of which involves considerable uncertainty 
even though the amt credit carryforwards do not expire  their use is not presently considered more likely than not because significant increases in earnings levels are expected to be necessary to utilize them since they must be used only after certain other carryforwards currently available  as well as additional tax credits which are expected to be generated in future years  are realized 
as a result of this assessment  the company reduced the beginning of the year tax valuation allowance by  in the fourth quarter of  with a corresponding credit to deferred income tax expense 
failure to achieve taxable income in the future  as so assessed  could affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  there can be no assurance that management s assessment of future taxable income will be achieved and that there could not be a subsequent increase in the valuation allowance 
it is also possible that the company could generate subsequent taxable income levels in the future which would cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize all  or an additional portion of  its deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets and upon reaching any different conclusion as to the appropriate carrying value of these assets  management will adjust them to their 
table of contents estimated net realizable value 
any such revisions to the estimated realizable value of the deferred tax assets could cause the company s provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although its cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefits of the various carryforwards were fully utilized 
however  because the remaining valuation allowance is related to specific deferred tax assets noted above  management does not anticipate further adjustments to the valuation allowance until the company s projections of future taxable income increase significantly 
in addition  certain other components of the company s provision for income taxes must be estimated 
these items include  but are not limited to  effective state tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time the tax provision is prepared 
income tax returns are generally not filed  however  until several months after year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  generally including renewal options 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
because significant judgments are required in estimating useful lives  which are not ultimately known until the passage of time and may be dependent on proper asset maintenance  and in the determination of what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair or maintenance expense  changes in circumstances or use of different assumptions could result in materially different results from those determined based on the company s estimates 
impairment of long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets most typically assets associated with a specific restaurant might be impaired  management compares the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted cash flows it expects that restaurant to generate over its remaining useful life 
in calculating its estimate of such undiscounted cash flows  management is required to make assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment  relative to the restaurant s future period of operation  sales performance  cost of sales  labor and operating expenses 
the resulting forecast of undiscounted cash flows represents management s estimate based on both historical results and management s expectation of future operations for that particular restaurant 
to date  all of the company s long lived assets have been determined to be recoverable based on management s estimates of future cash flows 
lease accounting the company is obligated under various lease agreements for certain restaurant facilities 
for operating leases  the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
capital leases are recorded as an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term or the fair market value of the leased asset 
under the provisions of certain of the company s leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the holidays and escalations have been reflected in capitalized costs or rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that the company will exercise its options for such periods due to the fact that the company would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments 
rent expense incurred during the construction period is capitalized as a component of property and equipment 
the leasehold improvements and property held under capital leases for each leased restaurant facility are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the expected lease term used for lease accounting purposes 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is accrued when it is deemed probable that percentage rent exceeds the minimum rent per the lease agreement 
allowances for tenant improvements received from the lessor are recorded as adjustments to rent expense over the term of the lease 
judgments made by the company related to the probable term for each restaurant facility lease affect the payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 

table of contents self insurance accrual at january  and december   the company s accruals for self insured group medical obligations totaled  and  respectively  and were included in the consolidated balance sheet caption accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
the liability for claims incurred but not paid  which includes claims incurred but not reported and claims reported but not paid  is an undiscounted amount calculated by applying a factor to the total of all claims incurred and paid during a particular fiscal year 
the factor is an estimate prepared by management and is based primarily on the company s historical experience relative to actual claims paid in years following the year in which the claim was incurred

on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under us generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result of this correspondence  the company performed a review of its lease related accounting policies and determined that certain adjustments  while immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements taken as a whole  were necessary relative to the company s consolidated balance sheet as of january  the adjustments related to leasehold improvements funded by landlords at two of the company s restaurants and the calculation of rent expense during the construction period for selected locations subject to operating lease agreements 
the effect of the adjustments was to increase the property and equipment balances as of january  by  for leasehold improvements funded by landlords and by  for capitalized rent expense associated with construction period rents 
deferred rent obligations were also increased by corresponding amounts relative to the aforementioned areas 
the adjustments had no impact on the company s net income or cash flows 
impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company continually seeks ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs  but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s net sales and net income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
net sales and operating income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season 
in addition  certain of the company s restaurants  particularly those located in southern florida  typically experience an increase in customer traffic during the period between thanksgiving and easter due to an increase in population in these markets during that portion of the year 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre opening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
a summary of the company s quarterly results for and appears in this report immediately following the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
while substantially all of the company s debt outstanding as of january  was at fixed rates  the company has historically utilized a mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see notes d and e to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company does not expect changes in market interest rates to have a material affect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
investment portfolio 
the company invests portions of its excess cash  if any  in highly liquid investments 
at january   the company had million in money market accounts 
the market risk on such investments is minimal due to their short term nature 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources 
when the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly  the company may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use 
the company routinely has purchase commitments for terms of one year or less for food and supplies with a variety of vendors  some of which are limited to a pricing schedule for the period covered by the agreements 
the company has established long term relationships with key beef  seafood and produce vendors and brokers 
adequate alternative sources of supply are believed to exist for substantially all products 
while the supply and availability of certain products can be volatile  the company believes that it has the ability to identify and access alternative products as well as the ability to adjust menu prices if needed 
significant items that could be subject to price fluctuations are beef  seafood  produce  pork and dairy products among others 
the company believes that any changes in commodity pricing which cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other product delivery strategies would not be material
