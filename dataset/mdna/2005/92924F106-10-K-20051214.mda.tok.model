regulatory matters executive overview introduction wgl holdings  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  sells and delivers natural gas and provides a variety of energy related products and services to customers primarily in washington  dc and the surrounding metropolitan areas in maryland and virginia 
the company s core subsidiary  washington gas  is involved in the delivery and sale of natural gas that primarily is regulated by state regulatory commissions 
through the wholly owned  unregulated subsidiaries of washington gas resources corporation washington gas resources  the company also offers energy related products and services that are related to its core business 
in response to changes in federal and state regulation  the company offers competitively priced natural gas and electricity to customers through washington gas energy services wgeservices  its unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiary 
wgl holdings has three operating segments that are described below regulated utility  retail energy marketing  and commercial heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac products and services 
transactions not specifically identifiable in one of the above three segments are accumulated and reported in the category other activities 
regulated utility 
with approximately percent of the company s consolidated total assets  the regulated utility segment consisting of washington gas and hampshire gas company delivers natural gas to retail customers in accordance with tariffs approved by the district of columbia  maryland and virginia regulatory commissions that have jurisdiction over washington gas rates 
these rates are intended to provide the regulated utility with an opportunity to earn a just and reasonable rate of return on the investment devoted to the delivery of natural gas to customers 
washington gas also sells natural gas to customers who have not elected to purchase natural gas from unregulated third party marketers 
the regulated utility does not earn a profit or incur a loss when it sells the natural gas commodity because utility customers are charged for the natural gas commodity at the same cost that the regulated utility incurs 
at september   the regulated utility was selling and delivering the natural gas commodity to percent of its customers 
the remaining percent of washington gas customers utilized the delivery services of washington gas for delivery of the natural gas commodity purchased from 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued unregulated third party marketers  one of which is wgeservices 
factors critical to the success of the regulated utility include i operating a safe and reliable natural gas distribution system  ii having sufficient natural gas supplies to serve the demand of its customers  iii being competitive with other sources of energy such as electricity  fuel oil and propane and iv being able to recover the costs and expenses of this business in the rates it charges to customers 
these costs and expenses include a just and reasonable rate of return on invested capital as authorized by the regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over the regulated utility s rates 
hampshire gas company hampshire  a wholly owned subsidiary of wgl holdings  operates an underground natural gas storage facility that is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
washington gas purchases all of the storage services of hampshire and includes the cost of these services in the bills sent to its customers 
hampshire operates under a pass through cost of service based tariff approved by the ferc  and adjusts its billing rates to washington gas on a periodic basis to account for changes in its investment in utility plant and associated expenses 
retail energy marketing 
wgeservices  a wholly owned subsidiary of washington gas resources  competes with other unregulated third party marketers by selling natural gas and electricity directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers  both inside and outside of the regulated utility s traditional service territory 
wgeservices does not own or operate any natural gas or electric generation  production  transmission or distribution assets 
rather  it sells natural gas and electricity with the objective of earning a profit  and these commodities are delivered to retail customers through the assets owned by regulated utilities  such as washington gas or other unaffiliated natural gas or electric utilities 
factors critical to the success of the retail energy marketing business are i managing the market risk of the difference between the sales price committed to customers under sales contracts and the cost of natural gas and electricity needed to satisfy these sales commitments  ii managing credit risks associated with customers of and suppliers to this segment  iii having sufficient deliverability of natural gas and electric supplies to serve the demand of its customers which can be affected by the ability of natural gas producers  pipeline gatherers  natural gas processors  interstate pipelines and suppliers of electricity to deliver the respective commodities and iv controlling the level of selling  general and administrative expenses  including customer acquisition expenses 
commercial hvac 
two wholly owned subsidiaries of washington gas resources  american combustion industries  inc aci and washington gas energy systems  inc wgesystems  provide turnkey  design build and renovation projects  and maintenance services to the commercial and government markets 
the commercial hvac operations focus on retrofitting the mechanical  electrical and energy related systems of a large number of aging commercial and government structures  primarily in the district of columbia and portions of maryland and virginia 
factors critical to the success of the commercial hvac business include i generating adequate revenue from the government and private sectors in the new construction and retrofit markets  ii building a stable base of service relationships  iii estimating and managing fixed price contracts and iv controlling selling  general and administrative expenses 
refer to the business section under item of this report for a further discussion of the company s regulated utility and unregulated businesses 
for a further discussion of the company s financial performance by operating segment  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance management believes that the following are key indicators for monitoring the company s financial condition and operating performance return on average common equity 
this measure is calculated by dividing twelve months ended net income applicable to common stock by average common shareholders equity 
for the regulated utility  management compares the actual return on common equity with the return on common equity that is allowed to be earned by regulators and the return on equity that is necessary for the company to compensate investors sufficiently and be able to continue to attract capital 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued common equity ratio 
this ratio is calculated by dividing total common shareholders equity by the sum of common shareholders equity  preferred stock and long term debt including current maturities 
maintaining this ratio in the mid percent range affords the company financial flexibility and access to long term capital at relatively low costs

primary factors affecting wgl holdings and washington gas the following is a summary discussion of the primary factors that affect the operations and or financial performance of the regulated and unregulated businesses of wgl holdings and washington gas 
refer to the section entitled business under item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these and other related factors that affect the operations and or financial performance of wgl holdings and washington gas 
weather conditions and weather patterns the company s regulated utility operations are weather sensitive  with a significant portion of its revenues derived from the delivery of natural gas to residential and commercial heating customers during the winter season 
generally  weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered by the regulated utility 
however  weather patterns may become erratic during shoulder months within the company s fiscal year in which the company is going into or coming out of the primary portion of its winter heating season 
during the shoulder months within quarters ending december particularly in october and november and within quarters ending june particularly in april and may  customer heating usage may not correlate highly with the level of recorded heating degree days during those months when weather patterns experienced are not consistently cold or warm 
the regulated utility s rates are determined on the basis of expected normal weather conditions 
as such  deviations in weather from normal levels can affect the company s financial performance 
prior to october   washington gas did not have a ratemaking provision in any of its jurisdictions that allowed for revenues to be adjusted for the difference between actual weather conditions in a particular year and the expected normal weather conditions that are used to establish rates 
instead  the regulated utility had a five year weather insurance policy designed to protect against a portion of warmer than normal weather for all of its jurisdictions 
this weather insurance policy expired on september  during fiscal year  washington gas initiated efforts to obtain ratemaking provisions in maryland and virginia that are designed to moderate the volatility of its revenues and customers monthly billing due to variations in weather from normal levels 
in august  washington gas received approval from the public service commission of maryland psc of md to implement a revenue normalization adjustment mechanism rna  a billing adjustment mechanism that is designed to stabilize the level of distribution charge revenues received from maryland customers as a result of deviations in customer usage caused by variations in weather from normal levels and other matters such as conservation 
the rna became effective on october   which is the start of the company s fiscal year additionally  in january  washington gas filed a proposed weather normalization adjustment clause wna with the state corporation commission of virginia scc of va to be implemented as an experimental pilot program 
the wna was intended to reduce the effect of weather volatility from normal levels both on customers bills and on the earnings of washington gas 
on december   the scc of va denied washington gas request to implement the proposed wna  but will permit the regulated utility to file a subsequent request for the wna in the context of a general rate proceeding refer to the section entitled rates and regulatory matters under item of this report 
on december   washington gas purchased a weather derivative as another form of weather protection to mitigate warmer than normal weather in virginia 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued washington gas has not sought a similar ratemaking provision with the public service commission of the district of columbia psc of dc 
however  effective october   the regulated utility obtained a new three year weather insurance policy designed to protect against nearly all of the effects of warmer than normal weather in the district of columbia 
the financial results of the company s energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  also are affected by deviations in weather from normal levels 
since wgeservices sells both natural gas and electricity  wgeservices financial results may fluctuate due to deviations in weather from fiscal year to fiscal year during the winter heating and summer cooling seasons 
refer to the section entitled weather risk included herein for a further discussion of the company s weather protection mechanisms 
regulatory environment and regulatory decisions washington gas is regulated by the psc of dc  the psc of md and the scc of va 
hampshire is regulated by the ferc 
these regulatory commissions set the rates in their respective jurisdictions that washington gas can charge customers for its rate regulated services 
changes in these rates as ordered by regulatory commissions affect the company s financial performance 
washington gas expects that regulatory commissions will continue to set the prices and terms for delivery service that give it an opportunity to earn a just and reasonable rate of return on the capital invested in its distribution system and to recover reasonable operating expenses 
wgl holdings is a registered holding company as defined by the public utilities holding company act of puhca 
on august   the president of the united states of america signed the energy policy act of epa  which authorizes many broad energy policy provisions including significant funding for consumers and business for energy related activities  energy related tax credits  accelerated depreciation for certain natural gas utility infrastructure investments and which contains the repeal of the puhca 
the effective date of the repeal is february  the company continues to evaluate the epa  but it expects to benefit from provisions embedded in the legislation that will support the company s efforts to promote energy efficiency in a manner that benefits customers and shareholders refer to the section entitled business under item of this report for a detailed discussion of this matter 
gas supply and pipeline transportation and storage capacity natural gas supply and capacity requirements 
washington gas is responsible for acquiring both sufficient natural gas supplies and interstate pipeline and storage capacity to meet customer requirements 
as such  washington gas must contract for reliable and adequate delivery capacity to its distribution system  while considering the dynamics of the interstate pipeline and storage capacity market  its own on system peaking facilities  as well as the characteristics of its customer base 
local distribution companies  such as washington gas  along with other participants in the energy industry  have raised concerns regarding the gradual depletion in the availability of additional interstate pipeline and storage capacity 
depleting pipeline and storage capacity is a business issue that must be managed by washington gas  whose customer base has grown at an annual rate between two and three percent 
this rate of growth is expected to continue 
to help maintain the adequacy of pipeline and storage capacity for its growing customer base  washington gas has contracted with various interstate pipeline and storage companies for the acquisition of additional existing capacity  as well as the construction of new capacity  for firm transportation and storage services to washington gas 
one recent project involving washington gas for the construction of new firm transportation and storage services was completed and placed into service for the winter heating season  adding  therms of daily transportation capacity   therms of daily storage transportation capacity and million therms of annual storage inventory for washington gas 
washington gas is involved in other capacity expansion projects that are expected to be placed into service during fiscal years washington gas will continue to monitor

gulf coast natural gas supply issues 
since the late summer of  the gulf coast region has experienced a major disruption of natural gas production and processing due to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
such natural gas production and processing disruptions have resulted in a significant reduction of the normal billion cubic feet of natural gas per day available to be delivered from the gulf coast region 
current forecasts by the federal government and other public information from various energy sources that are monitoring the status of gas flowing from the gulf coast suggest a resumption to near normal levels of natural gas production and processing during the course of the winter heating season  but they are not specific as to a scheduled timeframe nor the expected volume 
based on its evaluation of these forecasts  washington gas currently estimates that only approximately to percent of the pre hurricane natural gas production and processing from the gulf coast region will be available for the winter heating season 
the sources of washington gas natural gas supply for annual  seasonal  and design day delivery include firm transportation gas purchased and delivered through four interstate pipelines  gas in storage stored in facilities that are both company owned and leased from the interstate pipelines  various peaking facilities  and unregulated third party marketers 
washington gas has already delivered and injected into storage sufficient quantities of gas to maximize the availability of natural gas from its storage resources to meet customer demand for the winter heating season 
washington gas is also prepared with sufficient gas inventories in its local and contracted third party peaking resources to attempt to satisfy this demand 
historically  more than percent of washington gas firm transportation natural gas purchased and delivered through its contracted interstate pipeline services has been supplied from the gulf coast  traditionally a region where gas supply has been readily available on a daily basis 
immediately following hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  the amount of natural gas available to be introduced into the interstate pipelines in the gulf coast region was curtailed and allocated among the various shippers  including washington gas  that use interstate pipelines 
to date  washington gas has continued to meet its customers daily natural gas requirements and has achieved its required storage inventory balances through natural gas purchases subsequent to the hurricanes 
however  customer demand for natural gas in the mid atlantic and northeast regions has not yet increased to reflect the demand of the upcoming winter heating season 
washington gas believes that the gulf coast natural gas supply to be transported through its contracted interstate pipeline services for the winter heating season may be subject to certain limitations 
those limitations will be a function of customer demand colder than normal weather and the degree to which natural gas production and processing actually resume at normal operational capabilities 
based on this view  washington gas has modified the composition of its natural gas portfolio by updating its traditional purchasing plan for the winter heating season to include a significantly higher percentage of natural gas supply that is produced from sources outside of the gulf coast region 
for the winter heating season  washington gas estimates that approximately percent rather than the traditional percent of its firm transportation natural gas purchases and deliveries will come from the gulf coast region 
washington gas anticipates that it will rely upon other sources outside the gulf coast region for the remaining percent of these purchases  including natural gas from the appalachian and canadian regions  as well as increased levels of vaporized liquefied natural gas lng through the dominion cove point dominion or cove point lng terminal 
these natural gas supplies will be delivered to washington gas distribution system utilizing existing interstate pipeline resources under contract to washington gas that have transportation paths that support natural gas deliveries outside the gulf coast region 
assuming the current forecast for the resumption of gulf coast natural gas production and processing is accurate  washington gas currently estimates that the quantity of alternative sources of supply that it has included in its natural gas portfolio for the winter heating season will be sufficient to replace 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the loss of its traditional gulf coast natural gas supply due to ongoing  but slowly diminishing limitations in gulf coast natural gas production and processing 
this estimate includes the natural gas volumes that are the responsibility of unregulated third party marketers in the regulated utility s jurisdictional retail unbundling programs 
washington gas  as a provider of last resort  is ultimately responsible for serving its firm customers both bundled and unbundled  and has incorporated that responsibility into its estimate 
conversely  if gulf coast natural gas production and processing constraints remain at reduced levels of deliverability  then washington gas  under normal or colder than normal weather conditions during its winter heating season  may need to implement contingency plans in order to maximize the number of customers served under such conditions 
contingency plans include requests to conserve to the general population and targeted curtailments to specific sections of the system  consistent with curtailment tariffs approved by regulators in each of its three jurisdictions 
if requests to conserve are issued by washington gas or curtailments of supply result  the deliveries of natural gas that will be made by washington gas will be lower than the levels that would otherwise be expected 
if this occurs  the company s net revenues and net income would be adversely affected by lower deliveries of natural gas  an amount that management cannot estimate 
beyond the winter heating season  washington gas will seek to maintain diversification of its natural gas portfolio that incorporates other sources of supply outside the gulf coast region 
this will help washington gas to meet customer demand despite unforeseen future supply issues that may arise similar to those as a result of the weather events in the gulf coast region 
wgeservices also purchases a portion of its natural gas supply from the gulf coast region 
purchase commitments from certain of wgeservices gulf coast based natural gas suppliers have been interrupted by the recent supply shortage in the gulf coast region caused by weather events during the fall season 
all of wgeservices contracted natural gas supplies from the gulf coast region have  however  been flowing as contracted since november   and to date  wgeservices has continued to meet its customers daily natural gas requirements  and has achieved its required storage inventory balances through natural gas purchases subsequent to the hurricanes 
in meeting its natural gas supply needs for the winter heating season and beyond  wgeservices expects to continue to rely on a diverse set of supply sources 
assuming normal weather  wgeservices believes it has adequate natural gas supply to meet the demand of its retail customers under contract for the upcoming winter heating season 
should any suppliers of wgeservices fail to deliver natural gas under existing contracts due to the continuation of supply disruptions in the gulf coast region  wgeservices may be financially exposed for the difference between the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy natural gas  and the replacement cost of the gas that may need to be purchased to serve its customers 
should colder than normal weather be experienced in the geographic areas served by wgeservices  the energy marketing business could be required to secure additional natural gas supplies at unfavorable prices to meet the needs of its customers 
if wgeservices is unable to secure adequate supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of its retail customers  either due to the failure of its suppliers to deliver gas or the inability to secure additional quantities of natural gas in cold weather  wgeservices may be required to return customers to the bundled services of regulated utilities 
if such returns can be managed within standard regulated timeframes for returning customers to the utility  wgeservices losses would be limited to future margins on returned customers 
should supply limitations be so severe that wgeservices could not supply its customers within those timeframes  wgeservices could be exposed to significant penalties by the utility companies 
refer to the section entitled business under item of this report for a detailed discussion of this matter 
rising natural gas prices 
increased prices of natural gas are being driven by increased demand that is exceeding the growth in available supply 
as discussed above  the fall hurricane season significantly reduced the current and anticipated availability of natural gas supply from the gulf coast region  causing a dramatic rise in natural gas prices during the fourth quarter of fiscal year if 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued continued  the higher natural gas prices may result in significant increases in the cost of gas billed to customers during the upcoming winter heating season 
under its regulated gas cost recovery mechanisms  washington gas records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered in revenues from customers 
accordingly  an increase in the cost of gas due to an increase in the purchase price of the natural gas commodity generally has no direct effect on the regulated utility s net revenues and net income 
however  net income may be reduced primarily due to higher expenses that may be incurred for uncollectible customer accounts  as well as lower volumes of natural gas deliveries to firm customers that may result due to lower natural gas consumption caused by customer conservation 
increases in the price of natural gas also can affect the company s operating cash flows  as well as the competitiveness of natural gas as an energy source 
wgeservices may also be negatively affected by the indirect effects of significant increases in the wholesale price of natural gas that resulted from the gulf coast natural gas supply issues 
although wgeservices risk management policies and procedures are designed to minimize the risk that wgeservices natural gas purchases and the related sales commitments do not closely match  higher gas prices increase the costs associated with uncollectible accounts  borrowing costs  certain fees paid to public service commissions and other costs 
to the extent that these costs cannot be recovered from retail customers in higher rates due to competitive factors  wgeservices operating results would be negatively affected 
changes in natural gas consumption 
natural gas supply requirements may be affected by changes in natural gas consumption by customers 
natural gas usage per customer may decline as customers change their consumption patterns in response to i more volatile and higher natural gas prices  as discussed above  and ii customers replacement of older  less efficient gas appliances with more efficient appliances 
in each jurisdiction in which washington gas operates  changes in customer usage profiles have been reflected in recent rate case proceedings where rates have been adjusted to reflect current customer usage 
in both the district of columbia and virginia jurisdictions  changes in customer usage by existing customers that occur subsequent to these recent rate case proceedings will have the effect of reducing revenues  which is offset by the favorable effect of adding new customers 
effective october   pursuant to the rna approved by the psc of md  changes in customer usage by existing customers that occur subsequent to recent rate case proceedings in the maryland jurisdiction generally will not reduce revenues  but rather will have the effect of stabilizing the level of distribution charge revenues received from customers on a monthly basis for a further discussion of this regulatory matter  refer to the section entitled rates and regulatory matters under item of this report and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
electricity supply 
similar to the natural gas industry  electric customers may choose either to purchase bundled electricity service from their local electric distribution utility or to purchase electricity from a third party marketer  such as wgeservices 
future opportunities to add new electric customers may be limited by the relationship between electric standard offer service sos rates offered by local electric utilities and market prices for electricity 
certain sos rates in wgeservices market area continue to be below current market prices 
in certain cases  electric utilities have entered into wholesale contracts to supply their sos customers  prior to an increase in fuel prices required to generate electricity 
in other cases  electric utilities continue to provide service under previously established rates that are capped 
sos rates in maryland and the district of columbia will  however  continue to be reset to market rates through annual procurements  and may offer future opportunities to build the electric customer base 
refer to the section entitled market risk price risk related to retail energy marketing operations for a further discussion of wgeservices electricity supply 
maintaining the safety and reliability of the natural gas distribution system maintaining and improving the public safety and reliability of washington gas natural gas distribution system is the company s highest priority that benefits both customers and investors through lower costs and improved customer service 
washington gas continually refines its safety practices  with a particular 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued focus on design  construction  maintenance  operation  replacement  inspection and monitoring practices 
operational issues affecting the public safety and reliability of washington gas natural gas distribution system that are not responded to within a timely and adequate manner could significantly and adversely affect the future earnings and cash flows of the company  as well as result in a loss of customer confidence 
the company believes it is responding to its operational issues in a timely and adequate manner  and has the financial resources necessary to address these issues due to its current strong cash position  and the financing options it has available 
competitive environment competition with other energy products 
the regulated utility faces competition based on customers preference for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
the most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential market 
the residential market generates a significant portion of the regulated utility s net income 
in its service territory  washington gas continues to attract the majority of the new residential construction market 
consumers continuing preference for natural gas allows washington gas to maintain a strong market presence 
the regulated utility has generally maintained a price advantage over electricity in its service area for traditional uses of energy such as heating  water heating and cooking 
however  price volatility in the wholesale natural gas commodity market has resulted in significant increases in the cost of natural gas billed to customers 
such increases have resulted in the elimination of the traditional price advantage of natural gas 
however  electricity prices may also increase in the future as prices charged for fuel to generate electricity under existing contractual arrangements are renegotiated 
changes in the competitive position of natural gas have the potential to cause a decline in the number of natural gas customers added in future years 
at the present time  the regulated utility has seen no evidence of such a decline 
in the interruptible market  the regulated utility s customers must be capable of using a fuel other than natural gas when demand peaks for the regulated utility s firm customers 
in the interruptible market  fuel oil is the prevalent energy alternative to natural gas 
the regulated utility s success in this market depends largely on the relationship between natural gas and oil prices 
since the supply of natural gas primarily is derived from domestic sources  the relationship between supply and demand generally has the greatest impact on natural gas prices 
since a large portion of oil comes from foreign sources  political events can have significant influences on oil supplies and  accordingly  oil prices 
the introduction of non domestic supplies of lng into the united states natural gas market may affect supply levels and have an impact on natural gas prices 
to date  the effect of lng on supply levels has been minimal 
deregulation and unbundling 
in each of the jurisdictions served by the company s regulated utility  regulators and utilities have customer choice programs 
these programs allow customers to choose to purchase their natural gas and or electric commodity from unregulated third party marketers  rather than purchasing these commodities as part of a bundled service from the local utility 
when customers choose to purchase their natural gas commodity from unregulated third party marketers on an unbundled basis  there is no effect on the regulated utility s net revenues or net income since washington gas charges its customers the cost of gas without any mark up 
however  these customer choice programs provide unregulated third party marketers  such as wgeservices  with opportunities to profit from the sale of the natural gas commodity or electricity in competitive markets 
it also enables customers to have competitive choices for natural gas and electricity 
successfully participating in this evolving marketplace also poses risks and challenges that must continue to be addressed in the company s current and future strategies 
currently  the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and interstate pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that allow it to recover the invoice cost of gas  including both the commodity cost of gas and the interstate pipeline services  applicable to firm customers 
if washington gas were to determine that competition or changing regulation stemming 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued from future unbundling or other initiatives would preclude it from recovering these costs in rates  these costs would be charged to expense without any corresponding revenue recovery 
depending upon the timing  the effect of such a charge on washington gas financial position and results of operations would likely be significant 
in the event that a regulatory body disallows the recovery of such costs  these costs would be borne by shareholders unless the regulatory body would grant the rate relief for such costs in the form of transitioning from bundled to unbundled deregulated services that have been traditionally paid by all customers 
to manage this risk  washington gas has mechanisms in its customer choice programs that enable it to assign to participating unregulated third party marketers percent of the storage and peak winter capacity resources that were dedicated to serving bundled service customers when those customers elected an unregulated third party marketer 
additionally  washington gas currently has mechanisms approved by each of its local commissions to assign certain percentages of transportation capacity resources 
washington gas generally is renewing pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts to meet its forecasts of increased customer gas requirements and to comply with regulatory mechanisms to provide for or make available such resources to marketers serving customers in the customer choice programs 
unregulated retail energy marketing 
the company s unregulated subsidiary  wgeservices  competes with other unregulated third party marketers to sell the natural gas commodity to customers 
marketers of the natural gas commodity compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
wgeservices also competes with other unregulated third party marketers to sell electric supply services to customers 
as with natural gas  marketers of electric supply service compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
wgeservices is exposed to credit and market risks associated with both its natural gas and electric supply refer to the sections entitled market risk and credit risk included herein for a further discussion of this risk exposure and wgeservices management of them 
environmental matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters 
these evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long timeframe to control environmental effects 
washington gas believes  at this time  that appropriate remediation has been or is being undertaken at all the relevant sites 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these matters 
industry consolidation in recent years  the energy industry has seen a number of consolidations  combinations  disaggregations and strategic alliances 
consolidation will present combining entities with the challenges of remaining focused on the customer and integrating different organizations 
others in the energy industry are discontinuing operations in certain portions of the energy industry or divesting portions of their business and facilities 
from time to time  the company performs studies and  in some cases  holds discussions regarding utility and energy related investments and strategic transactions with other companies 
the ultimate effect on the company of any such investments and transactions that may occur cannot be determined at this time 
economic conditions and interest rates the company and its subsidiaries operate in one of the fastest growing regions in the nation 
the continued prosperity of this region  supported by a relatively low interest rate environment for new housing  has allowed the company s regulated utility to expand its regulated delivery service customer base at a rate of growth approximately twice the national industry average during the past five years 
in 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued addition  this economy has provided a robust market for the company s subsidiaries to market natural gas  electricity and other energy related products and services 
a downturn in the economy of the region in which the company operates  or a significant increase in interest rates which cannot be predicted with accuracy  might adversely affect the company s ability to grow its regulated utility customer base and other businesses at the same rate they have grown in the past 
the company has been operating in a relatively low interest rate environment in the recent past as it relates to long term debt financings 
short term interest rates had been relatively low in relation to historical levels 
however  actions and communications by the federal reserve in the past year have resulted in increases in short term interest rates and have signaled a likely continuation of these increases 
a rise in interest rates without the recognition of the higher cost of debt in the rates charged by the regulated utility to its customers would adversely affect future earnings 
a rise in short term interest rates would negatively affect the results of operations of the company s retail energy marketing segment which depends on short term debt to finance its accounts receivable and storage gas inventories 
inflation deflation from time to time  the company s regulated utility seeks approval for rate increases from regulatory commissions to help it manage the effects of inflation on its capital investment and returns 
the most significant impact of inflation is on the regulated utility s replacement cost of plant and equipment 
while the regulatory commissions  having jurisdiction over the regulated utility s retail rates  allow depreciation only on the basis of historical cost to be recovered in rates  the company anticipates that its regulated utility should be allowed to recover the increased costs of its investment and earn a return thereon  after replacement of the facilities occurs 
to the extent the company s regulated utility experiences a sustained deflationary economic environment  actual returns on invested capital could rise and exceed returns allowed by regulators in previous regulatory proceedings 
if this were to occur  it could prompt the initiation of a regulatory review to reduce the revenue of the regulated utility 
labor contracts  including labor and benefit costs the company has five labor contracts with three labor unions 
teamsters local union no 
local is a local union affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters

changes in accounting principles the company cannot predict the effect of potential future changes in accounting regulations or practices  that have yet to be issued  on its operating results and financial condition 
new accounting standards could be issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or the securities and exchange commission sec that could change the way the company records and recognizes revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
these changes in accounting standards could affect the company s reported earnings 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires the selection and the application of appropriate technical accounting rules to the relevant facts and circumstances of the company s operations  as well as the use of estimates by management to compile the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves judgment regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events  including the likelihood of success of particular regulatory initiatives  the likelihood of realizing estimates for legal and environmental contingencies  and the probability of recovering costs and investments in both the regulated utility and non utility operations 
the company has identified six critical accounting policies discussed below that require management s judgment and estimation  where such estimates have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for unbilled revenue and cost of gas recognition for regulated deliveries of natural gas  washington gas reads meters and bills customers on a cycle basis 
it accrues revenues for gas that has been delivered but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period 
in connection with making this accrual  washington gas must estimate the amount of gas that cannot be accounted for on its delivery system  and must estimate the amount of the unbilled revenue by jurisdiction and customer class 
such revenues are recognized as unbilled revenues that are adjusted in subsequent periods when actual meter readings are taken 
a similar computation is made for wgeservices 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
under these mechanisms  the regulated utility periodically adjusts its firm customers rates to reflect increases and decreases in the invoice cost of gas 
annually  the regulated utility reconciles the difference between the total gas costs collected from firm customers and the invoice cost of gas paid to suppliers 
the regulated utility defers any excess or deficiency and either recovers it from  or refunds it to  customers over a subsequent twelve month period 
accounting for regulatory operations regulatory assets and liabilities a significant portion of the company s business is subject to regulation by independent third party regulators 
as the regulated utility industry continues to address competitive market issues  the cost of service regulation used to compensate the company s regulated utility for the cost of its regulated operations will continue to evolve 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services could have additional long term financial implications for the company 
management has relied on its projection of continued regulatory oversight of its operations in order to validate the carrying cost of the regulated utility s investment in fixed assets 
washington gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which results in differences in the application of gaap between regulated and unregulated businesses 
sfas no 
requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in unregulated businesses 
in certain circumstances  sfas no 
allows entities whose rates are determined by third party regulators to defer costs as regulatory assets on the balance sheet to the extent that the entity expects to recover these costs in future rates 
similarly  sfas no 
requires that certain amounts be deferred and recorded as regulatory liabilities to the extent the regulated utility expects those amounts will be refunded to customers in future rates 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the company and washington gas discontinuing the application of sfas no 
for some of its businesses and require the write off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that would be no longer probable of recovery or refund 
in effect  
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s regulated utility could be required to write off certain regulatory assets and liabilities that had been deferred on the consolidated balance sheets in prior periods  and charge or credit these amounts to income at the time it determines that the provisions of sfas no 
no longer apply 
if washington gas were required to discontinue the application of sfas no 
for any of its operations  it would record an extraordinary non cash charge or credit to income for the net book value of its regulatory assets and liabilities 
other adjustments might also be required 
management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 
for the company s regulatory activities  and that all of its regulatory assets and liabilities as of september  and are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the company recognizes deferred income taxes for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires recognition of the additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes of the regulated utility 
regulatory assets or liabilities corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities may be recorded to the extent the company believes they will be recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process 
amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service 
any significant differences between management s estimates and actual tax amounts could have a material impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
accounting for contingencies the company accounts for contingent liabilities utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
by their nature  the amount of the contingency and the timing of a contingent event are subject to management s judgment of such events and management s estimates of the amounts 
actual results related to contingencies may be difficult to predict and could differ significantly from the estimates included in reported earnings 
in fiscal years and  the company was involved with regulatory contingencies with respect to rate cases in virginia and various legal contingencies 
on february   washington gas placed a proposed revenue increase into effect  subject to refund  pending the scc of va s final decision on an expedited rate case proceeding 
on september   the scc of va issued a final order requiring the company to adjust its billing rates to virginia customers to reflect the level of annual revenues approved pursuant to a december  final order of the scc of va 
refunds to customers  with interest  were made during the december billing cycle for the amount of the proposed annual revenue increase that had been collected since february  the company s financial results for the fiscal year ended september  reflected the proposed revenue increase  along with a provision for rate refunds to customers 
washington gas initially recorded this provision for rate refunds throughout fiscal year based on management s judgment of the future outcome  and later increased the provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in response to the september  final order  to reflect the full amount of revenues that had been collected subject to refund through september  accordingly  there was no effect on net income for fiscal year or for the rates initially put into effect in february in a final order issued by the scc of va on december   the scc of va ordered  among other things  that an annual earnings test be performed to determine if washington gas had earned in excess of its allowed rate of return on common equity for its virginia operations 
in the fiscal year ended september   washington gas recorded additional depreciation expense of million  on a pre tax basis  in connection with its earnings test performed for the twelve month period ended december  
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in fiscal year  the scc of va issued an order concluding that washington gas did not earn in excess of its allowed rate of return on common equity for the twelve month period ended december  and  therefore  was not required to record any additional depreciation expense related to earnings for that period 
accordingly  in fiscal year  washington gas reversed the million of depreciation expense  on a pre tax basis  that it had previously recorded in fiscal year related to this earnings test 
any significant differences between management s and the va staff s earnings test calculations or methodology would have an effect on the company s operating results 
for further discussion of these regulatory activities and related contingencies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it has properly applied and recorded the necessary provisions under sfas no 
associated with all material contingencies 
aci is engaged in binding arbitration proceedings with a general contractor 
aci claims that it was wrongfully terminated in january from completing work on behalf of the general contractor and is attempting to recover its accounts receivable 
in the same matter  the general contractor has made a counterclaim against aci for costs that it incurred to complete the project and legal fees 
aci has potential exposure for the sum of its receivable from the contractor and the amount of the counterclaim 
this amount is estimated to be a maximum of million 
at the present time  the company can not predict the outcome of the arbitration 
accounting for derivative instruments the company enters into forward contracts and other related transactions for the purchase of natural gas and electricity 
a majority of these contracts qualify as normal purchases and sales  and are exempt from the accounting requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
contracts that qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments subject to sfas no 
are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities  as discussed below  while changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not affected by rate regulation are reflected in income 
washington gas also utilizes derivative instruments that are designed to minimize the risk of interest rate volatility associated with planned issuances of medium term notes mtns 
management s judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment for washington gas derivative instruments 
this judgment involves various factors  including management s ability to i designate contracts and other activities as derivative instruments subject to the accounting guidelines of sfas no 
 ii derive the estimated fair value of its derivative instruments from period to period based on prices available from external sources and internal modeling techniques  and iii determine whether or not its derivative instruments are recoverable from or refundable to customers in future periods 
certain of the company s natural gas forward contracts and other derivatives that are subject to sfas no 
are valued using models developed by the company 
these models reflect  when appropriate  derivative pricing theory  formulated market inputs and forward price projections beyond the period that prices are available from market data sources 
the company derived a million net fair value gain for these contracts at september   which reflects management s best estimate 
as previously discussed  changes in the fair value of forward contracts and other related transactions that qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
and subject to sfas no 
are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities since they relate to activities of the regulated utility in which costs are likely to be recovered from or refunded to customers in future periods 
accordingly  changes in their fair value are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities 
should management determine that certain of its derivative instruments are not recoverable or refundable to customers  washington gas financial results may be subject to increased volatility from period to period due to potentially significant changes in the estimated fair value of derivative instruments that may occur and be recorded to either other comprehensive income loss or results of operations 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accounting for pension and other post retirement benefit plans washington gas maintains a qualified  trusteed  non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering all active and vested former employees of washington gas qualified pension plan  and a separate unfunded supplemental retirement plan covering executive officers serp 
washington gas also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
the qualified pension plan  serp and health and post retirement plans are hereinafter collectively referred to as the plans 
the measurement of the plans obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of factors 
these factors include historical information  such as employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  and earnings on the plans assets 
additionally  the company considers the following assumptions to be critical to the measurement of the plans obligations and costs 
these assumptions are derived on an annual basis with the assistance of a third party actuarial firm discount rate  expected long term return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and healthcare cost trend rate 
the company determines its discount rate based on the moody s aa corporate bond yield as of september the discount rate used to calculate the net periodic benefit obligations under the plans was percent and percent for fiscal years and  respectively 
the discount rate used to calculate the net periodic benefit costs under the plans was percent  percent and percent for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company determines the expected long term rate of return by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing the company s expected rate of return assumption  the company evaluates an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections  which gives consideration to the company s asset mix and anticipated length of obligation of the plans 
for its qualified pension plan  the company calculated its benefit costs using an expected long term return on plan assets of percent for both fiscal years and  and percent for fiscal year the expected long term return on plan assets for the health and life benefit plan was percent for both fiscal years and  and percent for fiscal year historically  the expected long term return on plan assets has been lower for the health and life benefit plan than for the qualified pension plan due to differences in the allocation of the assets in the plan trusts 
the company calculates the rate of compensation increase based on salary expectations for the near term  expected inflation levels and promotional expectations 
the company assumed the rate of compensation increase for the plans to be percent for fiscal years  and the healthcare cost trend rate is determined by working with insurance carriers  reviewing historical claims data for the health and life benefit plan  and analyzing market expectations 
the company assumed the initial healthcare cost trend rates related to the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for medicare and non medicare eligible retirees to be percent and percent  respectively  for fiscal year  as compared to percent and percent  respectively  for fiscal year the company expects these rates to decrease gradually to percent and percent  respectively  in and remain at those levels thereafter

fiscal year vs 
fiscal year the million  or per share  improvement in earnings for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  primarily reflects a million  or per share  improvement in the operating results of the company s major non utility operations  partially offset by million  or per share  of lower earnings by the regulated utility segment 
the company s retail energy marketing business drove most of the earnings growth from the major non utility operations 
earnings from the regulated utility segment for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  reflect lower natural gas deliveries to firm customers and higher operation and maintenance expenses and general taxes  partially offset by the favorable effect of changes in rates charged to customers  customer growth  lower interest expense and reduced income tax expense 
earnings comparisons between fiscal years and also reflect the following transactions related to the company s utility and non utility segments 
fiscal year included i a favorable tax adjustment of million  or per share  related to a change in estimate at the regulated utility segment  and ii a charge of million  or per share  that resulted principally from the resolution of a legal contingency related to the company s investment in its hvac business 
fiscal year included i the recognition of additional depreciation expense unrelated to fiscal year of million pre tax  or per share  that was recorded in connection with a virginia rate order  ii an after tax gain of million  or per share  realized in fiscal year from the sale of two buildings by a third party in a commercial real estate project in which the company held a carried interest accounted for under the equity method maritime sale  and iii a charge of million  or per share  for the impairment of goodwill related to the company s investment in its hvac business 
adjustments in fiscal year related to prior periods 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized the effect of adjustments attributable to prior fiscal years that improved net income by  after tax  or per share 
this amount included an increase to net income of million after tax  or per share  for adjustments related to the company s retail energy marketing segment 
this increase was partially offset by other adjustments principally related to the regulated utility segment which reduced consolidated net income by  after tax  or per share 
the company recognized the effect of these adjustments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as the effect of these adjustments  both individually and in the aggregate  were not material to fiscal years  and  and to prior interim periods 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year earnings comparisons between fiscal years and primarily reflect lower natural gas deliveries to firm customers in fiscal year  as well as increased utility operation and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expense 
favorably affecting earnings for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  was utility customer growth and the impact of favorable rate decisions  along with a slight improvement in the operating results of the company s major non utility operations 
as discussed above  fiscal year also benefited from the maritime sale  partially mitigated by the additional depreciation expense and goodwill impairment charge recorded in that year 
benefiting fiscal year were the following transactions related to the company s utility and non utility operating segments i an after tax gain of million  or per share  from the sale of the company s former headquarters property  ii an after tax gain of  or per share  from the sale of a real estate partnership interest  iii a favorable income tax adjustment of million  or

the following table summarizes the company s net income loss by operating segment for fiscal years ended september   and net income loss by operating segment years ended september  in thousands regulated utility non utility operations retail energy marketing commercial hvac total major non utility other  principally non utility activities total non utility net income regulated utility operating results the operating results of the company s core regulated utility operations are the primary influence on consolidated operating results 
the regulated utility operations are weather sensitive  with a significant portion of revenue coming from deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial heating customers 
for the fiscal year ended september   the regulated utility segment reported net income of million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  for fiscal year this earnings comparison primarily reflects a decrease in total natural gas deliveries to firm customers of million therms  or percent  to billion therms delivered during fiscal year although natural gas deliveries fell by percent  weather was unchanged in fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year 
weather for fiscal year  when measured by an industry standard called heating degree days  was percent colder than normal  and was estimated to have improved net income in fiscal year in relation to normal weather by approximately million  or per share 
for fiscal year  weather was percent colder than normal  and was estimated to have improved net income by approximately million  or per share 
the decrease in natural gas deliveries to firm customers is due  in part  to warmer weather experienced primarily during the second quarter of fiscal year  the most significant period of the company s winter heating season 
however  during other periods within fiscal year  the company experienced lower than expected natural gas deliveries because the increase in heating degree days did not correlate highly with the change in the volume of gas delivered during those periods 
while weather conditions generally have a direct influence on the volume of natural gas delivered by the regulated utility  weather patterns may become erratic during shoulder months within the fiscal year in which the company is going into or coming out of the primary portion of its winter heating season 
during the shoulder months within quarters ending december particularly in october and november and june particularly in april and may  customer heating usage may not correlate highly with the level of recorded heating degree days during those months when weather patterns experienced are not consistently cold or warm 
thus  as evidenced in fiscal year  usage patterns may not correlate highly with the level of degree days in periods that include shoulder months 
favorably affecting earnings for the regulated utility segment for fiscal year was the addition of  active customer meters  an increase of percent since the end of the prior fiscal year 
the current fiscal year also benefited from the favorable effect of changes in rates charged to customers that were

washington gas earns the pre tax cost of capital on the varying levels of storage gas inventory as a result of regulatory orders in all three of its jurisdictions 
fiscal year earnings for the regulated utility segment also reflect a million pre tax  or per share  increase in operation and maintenance expenses 
the percent year over year increase in these expenses primarily reflects i million of higher employee benefits expenses principally related to post retirement benefit costs  ii million of higher expenses associated with performing the initial assessment of internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  iii million of higher expenses for uncollectible accounts primarily due to higher natural gas prices  and iv million of higher labor related expenses which  in part  reflect increased overtime incurred in connection with the company wide response to issues that arose in a portion of the company s distribution system in prince george s county  maryland  such as special leak surveys  emergency response site visits and repairs  partially mitigated by the effect of percent fewer employees and reduced employee severance costs 
partially offsetting the increase in these expenses was the inclusion in fiscal year of a million accrual for unusual operational expenses that was not incurred in the current fiscal year 
further discussion of operation and maintenance expenses of the regulated utility is included herein under management s discussion for washington gas 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year declined by million pre tax  or per share 
the lower expense is attributable  in part  to a reversal in the current fiscal year of million of depreciation expense that was previously estimated and recorded in fiscal year related to the performance of an earnings test required by a december  final order by the scc of va virginia rate order 
the decline in this expense in fiscal year  when compared to  is also due to the inclusion in fiscal year of depreciation expense of million pre tax  or per share  applicable to the period from january  through november   that was recorded in connection with the virginia rate order refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s regulatory activities and related contingencies 
the year over year reduction in this expense was partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense in the current fiscal year related to an increased investment in property  plant and equipment 
the regulated utility segment also benefited in fiscal year from reduced income tax expense due to a combination of lower pre tax income and a lower effective income tax rate 
the lower income tax rate is primarily attributable to an increased non taxable benefit in fiscal year associated with a medicare prescription drug subsidy  and a favorable tax adjustment totaling million 
this segment incurred million pre tax  or per share  of increased general taxes  partially offset by million pre tax  or per share  of lower interest expense refer to the section entitled interest expense included herein 
for the fiscal year ended september   the regulated utility segment reported net income of million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  for fiscal year this comparison reflects a decrease in total gas deliveries to firm customers of million therms  or percent  to billion therms delivered during fiscal year  primarily due to percent warmer weather in fiscal year than in fiscal year  partially mitigated by the addition of  active customer meters  an increase of percent 
weather in fiscal year was percent colder than normal  and was estimated to have improved net income in fiscal year in relation to normal weather by approximately million  or per share 
during fiscal year  weather was percent colder than normal  enhancing net income by an estimated million  or per share  for that year 
in addition to utility customer growth  fiscal year benefited from the impact of rate changes that were implemented in maryland on november   in the district of columbia on november   and the effect of approximately one and one half months of a rate decision that became effective in virginia in november earnings for fiscal year  when compared to the prior fiscal year  also were affected by million  or per share  of increased operation and maintenance expenses  and 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million  or per share  of increased depreciation and amortization expense 
fiscal year also included an after tax gain of million  or per share  realized from the sale of the company s former headquarters property  and an adjustment to income taxes that improved net income in fiscal year by million  or per share 
further discussion of the operating results of the regulated utility is included herein in the management s discussion for washington gas 
non utility operating results the company s non utility operations are comprised of two business segments retail energy marketing and commercial hvac 
certain of the company s transactions are not significant enough to report as stand alone business segments  and therefore are aggregated as other activities which are included as part of non utility operations for purposes of segment reporting refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total net income for the company s non utility operations for fiscal year was million  or per share  an increase of million  or per share  over fiscal year this increase includes million  or per share  of increased earnings from the retail energy marketing segment to million  or per share 
this was coupled with a million  or per share  improvement in operating results from the commercial hvac segment to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal year other activities included in non utility operations for fiscal year declined million  or per share  from fiscal year to a net loss of million 
the results for fiscal year included an after tax gain of million  or per share  from the maritime sale 
non utility operations reported total net income of million  or per share  for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of million  or per share  over fiscal year the retail energy marketing segment contributed million  or per share  to the year over year improvement in earnings from non utility operations 
this improvement was substantially offset by a million  or per share  increased net loss incurred by the commercial hvac segment 
earnings comparisons between fiscal years and also reflect the million  or per share  after tax gain realized in fiscal year from the maritime sale  as compared to an after tax gain of  or per share  realized in fiscal year from the sale of a real estate partnership interest  and a favorable adjustment to income taxes in fiscal year of million  or per share  resulting from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards

electricity was provided to approximately  customers at september   compared to  and  customers at september  and  respectively 
the retail energy marketing segment reported net income of million for fiscal year  an increase over net income of million reported for the prior fiscal year 
the million year over year improvement included million after tax of reduced expenses related to the termination of two natural gas supply contracts  mark to market derivative gains of million after tax  and million after tax related to adjustments to revenue and cost of gas that were applicable to prior years 
the remainder of the year over year improvement in earnings for this segment was attributable to higher gross margins from the sale of natural gas and reduced expenses associated with uncollectible accounts  partially offset by lower gross margins from electric sales as the drop in sales volumes more than offset the increase in the gross margin per kilowatt hour sold 
during fiscal year  the energy marketing segment benefited from reduced expenses in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year of million after tax  or per share  related to the termination of contracts with two suppliers for the forward purchase of natural gas 
these fixed price contracts were terminated due to the natural gas suppliers expected inability to fulfill contractual obligations in the first quarter of fiscal year to the energy marketing business due to the natural gas supply shortage in the gulf of mexico region 
in consideration of the contract termination  the suppliers agreed to pay a fee to the energy marketing segment representing the difference between the fixed price and volume of gas under contract and the market price for forward delivery of the same volume of gas that was purchased by the energy marketing business to replace the contractual shortfall 
this fee was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a reduction to the cost of gas included in non utility operating expenses for the energy marketing segment  and the higher cost of the replacement gas will be recorded in fiscal year when delivered 
higher gross margins from the sale of natural gas  after taking into consideration the termination fee and revenue and cost of gas adjustments discussed above  reflect significant growth in gross margins per therm in fiscal year that were slightly offset by a decline of less than one percent in natural gas sales volumes 
the increased gross margins reflect the use of greater volumes of lower cost storage inventory compared to the prior fiscal year and the use of multiple supply options combined with differing weather patterns during the winter to enhance margins from customers 
increased gross margins on natural gas sales also reflect the realization of increased gains in the mark to market valuation associated with derivative contracts used in wgeservices gas supply portfolio to reduce the risk of variations in demand caused by weather 
these mark to market gains  when compared to the prior fiscal year  increased net income by million after tax  or per share refer to the section entitled market risk price risk related to retail energy marketing operations included herein 
these mark to market gains were realized principally in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of a sharp rise in natural gas prices during this period caused by the adverse effects of the hurricane season that resulted in a shortage of natural gas supply deliveries from the gulf of mexico region refer to the section entitled primary factors affecting wgl holdings and washington gas gas supply and storage capacity included herein for a further discussion of the gas supply shortage 
the earnings improvement for this segment also reflects a benefit of million after tax  or per share  in the current fiscal year for reduced expenses associated with uncollectible accounts due to enhanced recoveries of these accounts 
slightly tempering the earnings improvement for wgeservices was a decline in gross margins from electric sales in the current fiscal year  primarily reflecting a percent decline in electric sales volumes that was partially offset by an increase in the gross margin per kilowatt hour sold 
the decline in electric sales volumes primarily reflects changing market conditions that include intensified competition for large volume commercial customers  and utility standard offer service rates that are being offered at attractive  below market rates 
margins per kilowatt hour sold increased by almost percent when compared to the prior fiscal year due to the non renewal of several large volume customers that were previously served at lower per unit margins 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued looking ahead  in the near term  future opportunities to add new electric customers may be limited 
new sos rates offered by electric utilities that went into effect in maryland and the district of columbia in are below current market prices 
these electric utilities entered into contracts to supply their sos customers with electricity  prior to the large increase in fuel prices 
in the long term  however  sos rates in maryland and the district of columbia will be reset through annual procurements to rates that will likely reflect current market prices for fuel  and thereby are expected to offer continuing opportunities to build the electric customer base 
though the retail energy marketing segment earned higher than historical gross margins on natural gas sales in fiscal year  certain transactions that resulted in the record natural gas margins in the current fiscal year are not expected to be repeated in fiscal year these transactions along with the uncertainties regarding the availability of natural gas supply and the resulting upward pressure on natural gas prices  and the short term outlook for electric sales  cause the company not to foresee a continuation of the same level of profitability from the retail energy marketing segment in fiscal year as was experienced in fiscal year net income for the retail energy marketing segment was million  or per share  for fiscal year  an increase of million  or per share  over fiscal year the year over year improvement was attributable to higher gross margins from the sale of natural gas  partially offset by lower gross margins from the sale of electricity 
natural gas sales volumes increased by less than one percent over fiscal year  however gross margins per therm sold increased percent 
lower gross margins from electric sales for fiscal year resulted from an percent decline in kilowatt hours sold due to a reduction in the number of lower margin residential customers served based on company decisions not to renew certain contracts  as well as a reduction in commercial customers due to intensified competition for these customers 
commercial hvac 
two subsidiaries  aci and wgesystems  offer large scale hvac installations and related services to commercial and government customers 
these subsidiaries comprise the company s commercial hvac segment 
revenues for the commercial hvac segment were million for fiscal year  as compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the growth in revenues in fiscal year compared to was due to an increase in the number of service contracts with both commercial and institutional customers 
in fiscal years and  this segment experienced a decrease in revenues from fiscal year  reflecting a reduction in work performed on behalf of one major customer  the federal government  as well as a reduction in other business activity 
in fiscal years  and  the company generated revenues of approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  from the federal government 
for fiscal year  the commercial hvac segment incurred a net loss of million  or per share  reducing its net loss by million  or per share  from its fiscal year net loss of million 
this improvement primarily reflects improved operating margins during the current fiscal year due to a focus on higher gross margin service work  being more selective of construction jobs that are being undertaken  and reducing selling  general and administrative expenses 
also included in operating results for fiscal year was a charge of million  or per share  recorded in the current fiscal year that resulted principally from the resolution of a legal contingency related to the company s investment in its hvac business

fiscal year also reflects an  loss related to an interest rate swap  partially offset by interest associated with other miscellaneous items 
liquidity and capital resources general factors affecting liquidity it is important for the company to have access to short term debt markets to maintain satisfactory liquidity to operate its businesses on a near term basis 
acquisition of natural gas  electricity  pipeline capacity  and the need to finance accounts receivable are the most significant short term financing requirements of the company 
the need for long term capital is driven primarily by capital expenditures and maturities of long term debt 
significant swings can take place in the level of short term debt required by the company due primarily to changes in the price and volume of natural gas and electricity purchased to satisfy customer demand  and also due to seasonal cash collections on accounts receivable 
back up financing to the company s commercial paper program in the form of revolving credit agreements enables the company to maintain access to short term debt markets 
the ability of the company to obtain such financing depends on its credit ratings  which are greatly affected by the company s financial performance and the liquidity of financial markets 
also potentially affecting access to short term debt capital is the nature of any restrictions that might be placed upon the company such as ratings triggers or a requirement to provide creditors with additional credit support in the event of a determination of insufficient creditworthiness 
the ability to procure sufficient levels of long term capital at reasonable costs is determined by the level of the company s capital expenditure requirements  its financial performance  and the effect of these factors on its credit ratings and investment alternatives available to investors 
the company has a capital structure goal to maintain its common equity ratio in the mid percent range of total consolidated capital 
the level of this ratio varies during the fiscal year due to the seasonal nature of the company s business 
this seasonality is also evident in the variability of the company s short term debt balances  which are typically higher in the fall and winter months and substantially lower in the spring when a significant portion of the company s current assets is converted into cash at the end of the winter heating season 
accomplishing this capital structure objective and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings for the company and washington gas  and to allow access to capital at reasonable costs 
as of september   total consolidated capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt and excluding notes payable  comprised percent common equity  percent preferred stock and percent long term debt 
the cash flow requirements of the company and the ability to provide satisfactory resources to satisfy those requirements are primarily influenced by the activities of washington gas and  to a lesser extent  the non utility operations 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its financial obligations 
at september   the company did not have any restrictions on its cash balances that would affect the payment of common or preferred stock dividends by wgl holdings or washington gas 
short term cash requirements and related financing the regulated utility s business is weather sensitive and seasonal  causing short term cash requirements to vary significantly during the year 
over percent of the total therms delivered in the regulated utility s service area excluding deliveries to two electric generation facilities occur during the first and second fiscal quarters 
cash requirements peak in the fall and winter months when accounts receivable  accrued utility revenues and storage gas inventories are at their highest levels 
after the winter heating season  many of these assets are converted into cash  which washington gas generally uses to reduce and sometimes eliminate short term debt and to acquire storage gas for the next heating season 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  has seasonal short term cash requirements resulting from its need to purchase storage gas inventory in advance of the period in which the storage gas is sold 
in addition  wgeservices must continually pay its suppliers of natural gas and electricity before it collects its accounts receivable balances resulting from these sales 
wgeservices derives its funding to finance these activities from short term debt issued by the company 
both the regulated utility and the retail energy marketing segment maintain storage gas inventory 
wgeservices maintains storage gas inventory that is assigned to it by natural gas utilities such as washington gas 
storage gas inventories represent gas purchased from producers and are stored in facilities primarily owned by interstate pipelines 
the regulated utility and retail energy marketing subsidiary generally pay for storage gas between heating seasons and withdraw it during the heating season 
significant variations in storage gas balances between years are possible  and are caused by the price paid to producers and marketers  which is a function of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas and changing requirements for storage volumes 
for the regulated utility  such costs become a component of the cost of gas recovered from customers when volumes are withdrawn from storage 
in addition  the regulated utility is able to specifically earn and recover its pre tax cost of capital related to the varying level of the storage gas inventory balance it carries in each of the three jurisdictions in which it operates 
variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the regulated utility s gas cost recovery mechanisms and the level of refunds from pipeline companies that will be returned to customers can significantly affect short term cash requirements 
at september  and  the regulated utility had a million and million net over collection of gas costs  respectively 
the over collection in both fiscal years stemmed primarily from an excess of gas costs recovered from customers over gas costs paid to suppliers 
washington gas reflects the amounts under collected and over collected in the captions gas costs due from customers and gas costs due to customers  respectively  in its balance sheets as current assets and current liabilities 
amounts under or over collected that are generated during the current business cycle are reflected as a regulatory asset or liability until september of each year  at which time the accumulated amount is transferred to gas costs due from to customers as appropriate 
most of the current balance will be returned to  or collected from  customers in fiscal year at september  and  refunds received from pipelines and to be returned to the regulated utility s customers were not material 
the company and washington gas utilize short term debt in the form of commercial paper or unsecured short term bank loans to fund seasonal requirements 
the company s policy is to maintain back up bank credit facilities in an amount equal to or greater than its expected maximum commercial paper position 
from april  to september   wgl holdings and washington gas had revolving credit agreements with a group of commercial banks in the amount of million each that were due to expire on april  and april   respectively 
these credit facilities permitted wgl holdings and washington gas to request and the banks to approve  an additional line of credit of million and million  respectively  above the original credit limit for the company and washington gas 
on september   wgl holdings and washington gas each amended and restated their existing revolving credit facilities 
the amended and restated credit facilities the amended and restated credit facilities are with a group of commercial banks  and expire on september  the amended and restated credit facility for wgl holdings permits it to borrow up to million  and further permits the company to request prior to september   and the banks to approve  an additional line of credit of million above the original credit limit  for a maximum potential total of million 
the amended and restated credit facility for washington gas permits it to borrow up to million  and further permits washington gas to request prior to september   and the banks to approve  an additional line of credit of million above the original credit limit  for a maximum potential total of million 
as of september   there were no outstanding borrowings under either the wgl holdings or washington gas credit facilities 
at september   the company had outstanding notes payable of million in the form of commercial paper  as compared to million outstanding at september  of the outstanding notes payable balance at september   million and million was commercial paper issued

as a result of concerns about the sufficiency of the supply of natural gas and other factors during the winter of  the price of the natural gas commodity that is paid by the company s customers has risen sharply from levels experienced during the winter of customers bills are expected to increase dramatically in the winter of the increased bills are likely to cause increased difficulty for customers to pay their bills in a timely manner or  in certain situations  to be able to pay their bills 
this situation will likely cause the company and washington gas to be required to finance a higher level of accounts receivable for a longer period of time  and to incur higher short term debt levels and greater short term debt costs to finance these receivables than would be incurred absent these circumstances 
long term cash requirements and related financing the company s long term cash requirements primarily depend upon the level of capital expenditures  long term debt maturity requirements and decisions to refinance long term debt 
historically  the company has devoted the majority of its capital expenditures to adding new regulated utility customers in its existing service area 
however  as a result of recent operating issues in prince george s county  maryland described later in management s discussion  the company forecasts a greater level of replacement capital expenditures over the next two and one half years refer to the section entitled capital expenditures included herein 
at september   washington gas was authorized to issue up to million of long term debt under a shelf registration that was declared effective by the sec on april  on may   washington gas executed a distribution agreement with certain financial institutions for the issuance and sale of debt securities included in the shelf registration statement

in the event the long term debt of washington gas is downgraded below certain levels  wgl holdings and washington gas would be required to pay higher facility fees 
there are five different levels of fees 
the amended and restated credit facility for wgl holdings defines its applicable fee level as one level below the level applicable to washington gas 
under the terms of the amended and restated credit facilities  the lowest level facility fee is six basis points and the highest is ten basis points 
under the terms of the amended and restated credit facilities  the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization can not exceed to percent 
in addition  wgl holdings and washington gas are required to inform lenders of changes in corporate existence  financial conditions  litigation and environmental warranties that might have a material adverse effect 
the failure to inform the lenders agent of changes in these areas deemed material in nature might constitute default under the agreement 
a default  if not remedied  may lead to a suspension of further loans and or acceleration in which obligations become immediately due and payable 
at september   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under its revolving credit facilities 
regarding certain of the regulated utility s gas purchase and pipeline capacity agreements  if the long term debt of washington gas is downgraded below bbb by standard poor s ratings services or below baa by moody s investors service  or washington gas is deemed by a counterparty not to be creditworthy  the counterparty may withhold service or deliveries  or may require additional credit support 
cash flows provided by operating activities the primary drivers for the company s operating cash flows are cash payments received from gas customers  offset by payments made by the company for gas costs  operation and maintenance expenses  taxes and interest costs 
current interest expense reflects the favorable effect of relatively low short term interest rates  a condition that has begun to change as short term interest rates have risen 
during the first six months of the company s fiscal year  the company typically generates more net income than its annual net income net losses are normally generated in the last six months of the fiscal year due to the significant volumes of natural gas that are delivered by the regulated utility during the winter heating season 
variations in the level of net income reported for the fiscal six month period ended 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued march may be significant because of the variability of weather and other related factors from one period in a year to the same period in the subsequent year 
generating large sales volumes during the six month period ended march increases accounts receivable from the level at september  likewise  accounts payable increases to pay providers of the natural gas commodity 
accounts payable for the natural gas commodity can also vary significantly from one period to the next because of the volatility in the price of natural gas 
storage gas inventories  which usually peak by november  are largely drawn down in the six months ended march  and provide a source of cash as this asset is used to satisfy winter sales demand 
gas costs due from or to customers and deferred purchased gas costs  which represent the difference between gas costs that have been paid to suppliers and what has been collected from customers  can also cause significant variations in operating cash flows from period to period 
during the last six months of the company s fiscal year  after the winter heating season  the company will generally report a seasonal net loss due to reduced demand for natural gas during this period 
additionally  many of the company s assets  which were generated during the winter heating season  are converted into cash 
the company generally uses this cash to reduce and sometimes eliminate short term debt  and acquire storage gas for the next heating season 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
a description of certain material changes in working capital from september  to september  is listed below storage gas inventory increased million from the end of september  due to higher natural gas prices and increased storage capacity to accommodate the requirements for the winter heating season 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased million from september  largely to fund higher natural gas purchases 
higher liabilities associated with natural gas are due mostly to higher prices associated with storage injections 
customer deposits and advance payments increased million from september  the increase in cash deposits was driven by a revised credit policy requiring security deposits from new customers of the regulated utility  and the receipt of a security deposit held from an electricity supplier of wgeservices

accordingly  the remaining note receivable and corresponding long term note payable related to the gsa construction project were removed from the company s financial statements at december  as a result of gsa s final acceptance  gefa has no further recourse against the company related to the extinguished long term debt 
operating issues in prince george s county  maryland 
on april   washington gas reported that it would address a significant increase in the number of natural gas leaks on its distribution system in a portion of prince george s county  maryland 
washington gas determined that these leaks resulted from the shrinkage of seals located in mechanical couplings that connect sections of distribution mains and services 
given the increase in the number of natural gas leaks  washington gas announced that it would replace gas service lines and rehabilitate gas mains that contain the applicable mechanical couplings in the affected area of the distribution system in prince george s county the rehabilitation project by the end of december  even if no leaks have been detected 
the rehabilitation project is currently expected to cost million 
the company s planned capital expenditures for fiscal years through reflect the current cost estimate of the rehabilitation project refer to the section entitled liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures included herein 
this 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued current cost estimate could differ materially from the actual costs incurred for the work associated with this project 
however  washington gas has the financial resources necessary to fund this project due to its current strong cash position  and the financing options it has available 
management of washington gas considers the cost of the rehabilitation project described above necessary to provide safe and reliable utility service 
management anticipates that costs such as these eventually will be recognized in the ratemaking process as reasonable 
washington gas has not yet requested recovery of the costs 
however  washington gas is considering the effect of these capital expenditures on its ability to earn its allowed rate of return in maryland  and is evaluating the most appropriate options to enable full and timely recovery of  and return on  the amounts to be expended 
there can be no prediction at this time that recovery in rates will be allowed or at what point in time such recovery may begin to be reflected in rates 
significant negative effects on earnings in future years could result if such costs are incurred and recovery in rates is not allowed 
washington gas retained a consultant to determine the reason for the increase in leaks in the affected area of prince george s county 
based on the work conducted to date  there is a combination of three contributing factors to the higher leak rates of seals on couplings 
however  the relevant factor is the change in the gas composition resulting from a change in the gas supply arising from the reactivation of the cove point lng terminal owned by dominion resources  inc the cove point gas has a lower concentration of heavy hydrocarbons hhcs than domestic natural gas 
a characteristic of the rubber material comprising the seals in the couplings is the ability of the seals to both adsorb and desorb hhcs 
when seals are exposed to higher levels of hhcs  they swell in size and cause a tighter seal 
however  when gas is introduced that has a lower level of hhcs  the seals shrink in size and there is a greater propensity for those seals to cause the couplings to leak 
also considered as contributing factors to a higher failure rate for seals of this nature are the age of the couplings and the colder ground temperature during winter periods 
however  both the age of the couplings and the ground temperature are common to couplings in other areas of washington gas service territory where leak patterns have not been observed like those in the affected area of prince george s county 
thus  the relevant change that explains the higher incidence of leaks in the affected area of prince george s county is the composition of the gas resulting from the introduction of cove point gas 
the consultant hired by washington gas believes that the condition caused by the gas coming from the cove point terminal is reversible 
washington gas is examining potential approaches that will enable it to reverse or reduce the effect of the introduction of gas from the cove point terminal on the distribution system in the affected area of prince george s county 
washington gas is also examining these approaches to limit the potential effect of cove point gas on other areas of its distribution system 
the current cost estimate of the rehabilitation project  as discussed above  does not consider any costs associated with implementing any of these remediation activities 
because of the high concentration of cove point gas being received at the gate station that serves the affected area of prince george s county  washington gas has begun to construct a facility to inject hhcs at this particular gate station  this facility is expected to be operational in january  at an additional cost of million 
although the installation of the equipment at this gate station may reverse or partially reverse the effect of the cove point gas on the distribution system in the affected part of prince george s county and reduce the current cost estimate of million  washington gas plans to continue the rehabilitation of the area in prince george s county and to continue performing special leak surveys until there is appropriate evidence that the desired reversal has occurred 
washington gas has begun the planning necessary to construct similar facilities at the other six gate stations in anticipation that cove point gas flowing into the interconnected pipelines may increase prior to the concept of such a facility is similar in design to washington gas existing process of odorizing natural gas by injecting natural gas with a chemical that gives it its unique odor 
although small in scale  odorizing natural gas is an automated process completed at each gate station

credit risk regulated utility operations certain suppliers that sell gas to washington gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility may need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher than the original transaction prices  and pass these costs through to its sales customers under the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms refer to the section entitled market risk price risk related to regulated utility operations included herein 
to manage this supplier credit risk  washington gas screens suppliers creditworthiness and asks suppliers as necessary for financial assurances including  but not limited to  letters of credit and parental guarantees 
in response to the continued rise in natural gas prices  washington gas has requested and received increased levels of financial assurance from its suppliers 
retail energy marketing operations natural gas 
certain suppliers that sell natural gas or electricity to wgeservices have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
depending on the ability of these suppliers to deliver natural gas or electricity under existing contracts  wgeservices could be financially exposed for the difference between the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy these commodities  and the replacement cost of these commodities that may need to be purchased 
wgeservices has a wholesale supplier credit policy that is designed to mitigate wholesale credit risks through a requirement for credit enhancements 
in accordance with this policy  wgeservices has obtained credit enhancements from certain of its suppliers 
in response to the significant rise in natural gas prices  wgeservices has increased the unsecured credit limits it will accept from certain suppliers or their guarantors 
this will allow wgeservices to have greater flexibility in obtaining alternative sources of natural gas supplies in the event of non performance by one or more of its suppliers

for a further discussion of the credit risk associated with wgeservices electricity suppliers  refer to the section entitled market risk price risk related to retail energy marketing operations included herein 
market risk the company is exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity price risk  weather risk and interest rate risk 
the following discussion describes these risks and the company s management of them 
price risk related to regulated utility operations washington gas actively manages its gas supply portfolio to balance its sales and delivery obligations 
the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
the regulated utility s 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that allow it to recover the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
in order to mitigate commodity price risk for its firm customers  washington gas has specific regulatory approval in the district of columbia  maryland and virginia to hedge transactions for a limited portion of its natural gas purchases 
three types of hedge instruments were approved for the company s use i forward gas purchases at a fixed price  ii purchases of call options that effectively cap the cost of gas  and iii a combination of call options purchased and put options sold that limits natural gas price exposure within a narrow band 
while the regulatory approval for virginia is permanent  the regulatory approvals in the district of columbia and maryland are pursuant to pilot programs  and the company is seeking to continue these programs 
additionally  to provide for additional supply reliability  the regulated utility purchases natural gas under contracts that provide for volumetric variability 
certain of these contracts are required to be recorded at fair value refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for these derivative instruments 
at september   the company s variable gas purchase contracts had a net fair value gain of million 
of this amount  million represented a fair value gain that was recorded on the balance sheet as a receivable  with a corresponding amount recorded as a regulatory liability 
this was partially offset by a million fair value loss that was recorded on the balance sheet as a payable  with a corresponding amount recorded as a regulatory asset 
at september   the contracts had a net fair value loss of million which was recorded on the balance sheet as a payable  with a corresponding amount recorded as a regulatory asset 
this accounting is in accordance with regulatory accounting requirements for recoverable or refundable costs in each jurisdiction 
the regulated utility also mitigates price risk by injecting natural gas into storage during the summer months when prices are generally lower and less volatile  and withdraws that gas during the winter heating season when prices are generally higher and more volatile 
hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which occurred at a time when washington gas typically injects natural gas into storage  resulted in a disruption in natural gas production and processing from the gulf coast region 
this disruption reduced the availability of gulf coast based natural gas supply and placed significant upward pressure on natural gas prices 
despite these market conditions  washington gas has already delivered and injected into storage sufficient quantities of gas to maximize the availability of natural gas from its storage resources to meet customer demand for the winter heating season 
price risk related to retail energy marketing operations the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  sells natural gas and electricity to retail customers at both fixed and indexed prices 
the company must manage daily and seasonal demand fluctuations for these products 
the volume and price risks are evaluated and measured separately for natural gas and electricity 
natural gas 
wgeservices is exposed to market risk to the extent it does not closely match the timing and volume of natural gas it purchases with the related fixed price or indexed sales commitments 
wgeservices risk management policies and procedures are designed to minimize these risks 
wgeservices also faces risk in that approximately percent of its annual natural gas sales volumes are subject to variations in customer demand caused by fluctuations in weather 
purchases of natural gas to fulfill retail sales commitments are made generally under fixed volume contracts that are based on normal weather assumptions 
if there is a significant deviation from normal weather that causes purchase commitments to differ significantly from sales levels  wgeservices may be required to buy incremental natural gas or sell excess natural gas at prices that negatively impact gross margins 
wgeservices manages this volumetric risk by using storage gas inventory and peaking services offered to marketers by the regulated utilities that provide delivery service for wgeservices customers 
wgeservices may also manage price risk through the use of derivative instruments 
at september  and  these derivative instruments were recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets as a fair value gain of million and  respectively 
in connection with these derivative instruments  wgeservices 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recorded pre tax gains of million   and  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
electricity full requirements supply 
for a portion of its electricity supply  wgeservices limits its volumetric and price risks by purchasing full requirements services from its wholesale electricity suppliers under master purchase and sale agreements  including electric energy  capacity and certain ancillary services  for resale to retail electric customers 
wgeservices full requirements wholesale suppliers assume the risk for any volume and price risks associated with sales made by wgeservices 
wgeservices principal supplier of full requirements electricity is mirant americas energy marketing lp maem  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of mirant corporation mirant 
on july   mirant and substantially all of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
maem was included in these bankruptcy filings 
as of october   maem had completed performance on all of its supply obligations to wgeservices under contracts entered into prior to the bankruptcy 
these pre bankruptcy petition contracts expired on or before october  in october  wgeservices and maem signed a post bankruptcy petition contract that enables wgeservices to renew expiring contracts with its current electric customers  and to make purchases for new customers 
these post bankruptcy petition contracts include provisions that allow wgeservices to net payables to maem against any damages that might result from default on the part of maem  and allow wgeservices to request collateral under certain situations 
at september   wgeservices held collateral totaling million related to electric purchase transactions under the post bankruptcy petition contract 
this collateral is intended to represent the difference between the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy electricity  and the replacement cost of the electricity that may need to be purchased in the event of non performance by maem 
there was no collateral held at september  related to electric purchase transactions under the post bankruptcy petition contract 
due to timing differences that may arise between when collateral is requested by wgeservices and when it is actually received from maem  wgeservices exposure to maem under this contract may exceed the collateral held at any time 
wgeservices has made efforts to reduce its reliance on a single electric supplier for full requirements supply 
in addition to maem  wgeservices has separate master purchase and sale agreements under which it purchases full requirements services from other wholesale electricity suppliers 
these electric suppliers either have investment grade credit ratings or provide guarantees from companies with investment grade credit ratings 
electric suppliers other than maem accounted for approximately ten percent of wgeservices full requirements electric purchases for fiscal year electricity non full requirements supply 
in order to improve its competitive position and to further diversify its electricity supply sources  commencing in the second half of fiscal year  wgeservices began procuring electricity supply under contract structures other than full requirements contracts 
wgeservices assembled the various components of supply  including electric energy  capacity  ancillary services and transmission service from multiple suppliers to match its customer requirements 
this new strategy also reduces the potential credit exposure that wgeservices otherwise faced when dealing almost exclusively with maem 
under this purchasing approach  wgeservices assumes the responsibility of matching its customer requirements with its supply purchases 
to the extent wgeservices is not able to match its customer requirements relatively closely with its supply purchases  it is exposed to electricity commodity price risk on the unmatched portion of its portfolio 
wgeservices electric business also is exposed to fluctuations in weather 
these non full requirements purchases generally are made under fixed volume contracts that are based on certain weather assumptions 
if there are significant deviations in weather from these assumptions  wgeservices could be exposed to hourly price and volume risk that can negatively impact gross margins 
at september   percent of the wgeservices electric supply portfolio was provided under non full requirements contracts 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued value at risk 
wgeservices measures the market risk of its energy commodity portfolio and employs risk control mechanisms to measure and determine mitigating steps related to market risk  including the determination and review of value at risk 
value at risk is an estimate of the maximum loss that can be expected at some level of probability if a portfolio is held for a given time period 
based on a percent confidence interval for a one day holding period  wgeservices value at risk at september  was approximately  and  related to its natural gas and electric portfolios  respectively 
wgeservices value at risk calculations related to its electric portfolio results from wgeservices new procurement strategy for purchasing non full requirements electric services as discussed above 
weather risk the company is exposed to various forms of weather risk in both its regulated utility and unregulated businesses 
for the regulated utility  a large portion of the company s revenues is volume driven and its current rates are based upon an assumption of normal weather 
variations from normal weather will cause the company s earnings to increase or decrease  depending on the weather pattern 
prior to october   the company managed weather risk for all jurisdictions of the regulated utility with a weather insurance policy 
as discussed below  washington gas initiated efforts in fiscal year to obtain ratemaking provisions in maryland and virginia that are designed to moderate the volatility of its revenues and customers monthly billing due to variations in weather from normal levels 
washington gas has not sought a similar ratemaking provision in the district of columbia and  therefore  relies on weather insurance to protect against a portion of warmer than normal weather in the district of columbia  as discussed below 
the financial results of the company s non regulated energy marketing business  wgeservices  are also affected by variations from normal weather in the winter relating to its gas sales  and in the summer relating to its electricity sales 
wgeservices manages its weather risk with  among other things  a weather hedge  which is also discussed below 
billing adjustment mechanism 
in august  washington gas received approval from the psc of md to implement a revenue normalization adjustment rna  a billing adjustment mechanism that is designed to stabilize the level of distribution charge revenues received from maryland customers as a result of deviations in customer usage caused by variations in weather from normal levels and other matters such as conservation 
the rna became effective on october   which is the beginning of the company s fiscal year refer to the section entitled rates and regulatory matters under item of this report and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this matter 
weather insurance 
in october  washington gas purchased a weather insurance policy covering all of its jurisdictions in order to minimize a portion of the impact of warmer than normal weather on the company s financial results 
the policy had a five year term that expired on september   and had a pre tax annual cost of million for fiscal years  and on october   washington gas purchased a new weather insurance policy designed to protect against nearly all of its exposure to warmer than normal weather in the district of columbia 
this new policy has a three year term that expires on september  the new policy covers washington gas estimated net revenue exposure in the district of columbia to variations in heating degree days hdds  subject to a maximum annual payment of million pre tax and cumulative maximum payments of million pre tax over the three year policy period 
pre tax income is provided in the amount of approximately  for each hdd warmer than normal during each fiscal year subject to the limitations previously described 
other than the cost of the insurance  washington gas pays nothing if weather is colder than normal 
the policy s pre tax annual cost will be million for fiscal year  and million for each of fiscal years and no portion of the cost or benefit of this policy is considered in the regulatory 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued process 
a further description of the accounting for weather insurance may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
hdd derivatives 
on december   washington gas purchased an hdd derivative to protect against warmer than normal weather in virginia 
washington gas will receive  for every hdd below  during the period of december  through may  the maximum amount that washington gas can receive under this arrangement is million 
the pre tax cost of this derivative is million 
wgeservices utilizes hdd derivatives to manage its risk for natural gas customers who participate in a program that allows them to pay a fixed amount for their gas requirements regardless of the amount of gas consumed  and to manage other weather related risks 
these hedges cover a portion of wgeservices estimated net revenue exposure to variations in hdds 
for fiscal years and  the company recorded  net of premium costs  a net loss of  and  related to these hedges  respectively  and a net gain of  for fiscal year interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its debt financing costs 
management of this risk is discussed below 
long term debt 
at september   the regulated utility had fixed rate mtns and other long term debt aggregating million in principal amount  excluding current maturities and unamortized discounts  and having a fair value of million 
fair value is defined as the present value of the debt securities future cash flows discounted at interest rates that reflect market conditions as of september  while these are fixed rate instruments and  therefore  do not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
a total of million  or approximately percent  of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  excluding current maturities  have unexpired put options 
in addition  a total of million  or approximately percent  of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  excluding current maturities  have make whole call options  and no associated put options 
using sensitivity analyses to measure this market risk exposure  the regulated utility estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by ten percent  or basis points  from current market levels 
the company also estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates were to increase by ten percent  or basis points  from current market levels 
in general  such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
derivative instruments 
washington gas utilizes derivative financial instruments from time to time in order to minimize its exposure to the risk of interest rate volatility 
as discussed below  during fiscal years  and  washington gas entered into forward starting swaps that were intended to mitigate a substantial portion of the risk of rising interest rates associated with anticipated future debt issuances 
in july  washington gas entered into two forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
these swaps are scheduled to terminate concurrent with the execution of debt issuances that are planned for may at september   these swaps had a fair value gain totaling  in september  washington gas entered into two forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
at september   these swaps had a fair value loss totaling  in august  washington gas terminated the two forward starting swaps concurrent with the august issuances of mtns totaling million  as discussed previously in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources long term cash requirements and related financing included herein 
washington gas paid a total of million associated with the settlement of these hedge agreements 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in june  washington gas entered into two forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
in november  washington gas terminated million of the total million aggregate notional principal amount of the forward starting swaps concurrent with the november issuance of million of mtns  as discussed previously in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources long term cash requirements and related financing included herein 
washington gas received million associated with the settlement of this hedge agreement 
in december  washington gas terminated the remaining million aggregate notional principal of the forward starting swaps  and received million associated with the settlement of this hedge agreement 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the accounting for these transactions 
as discussed in this report  the company and washington gas utilize commercial paper to satisfy short term borrowing requirements 
short term interest rates had been relatively low in relation to historical levels 
actions and communications by the federal reserve in the past year  however  have resulted in increases in short term interest rates and have signaled a likely continuation of these increases 
increases in short term interest rates may reduce the profitability of the company and washington gas to the extent those higher interest rates are not timely reflected in utility rates or can not be reflected in the prices charged by wgeservices 

table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued washington gas light company this section of management s discussion focuses on the financial position and results of operations of washington gas for the reported periods 
in many cases  explanations for the changes in financial position and results of operations for both wgl holdings and washington gas are substantially the same 
results of operations summary results washington gas net income applicable to its common stock was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the following table provides the key factors contributing to the changes in utility net revenues between years 
composition of utility net revenue changes increase decrease in millions from prior year gas delivered to firm customers volumetric effect weather and usage customer growth impact of rate cases a gas delivered to interruptible customers other a total a for fiscal year  impact of rate cases includes a million benefit of an accounting tracker granted by the psc of dc related to pension and other post employment benefit expenses  and other excludes this benefit 
utility net revenues utility net revenues for washington gas were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year net revenues for fiscal year primarily reflect lower natural gas deliveries to firm customers  despite the fact that weather was relatively unchanged for the current fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year  as further discussed below 
favorably contributing to net revenues for fiscal year was the addition of  active customer meters  representing an increase of percent  coupled with the favorable effect of changes in rates charged to customers that were implemented in maryland on november  and the district of columbia on november  utility net revenues of million for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year net revenues for fiscal year were affected primarily by weather  which was percent warmer in fiscal year than in fiscal year favorably contributing to net revenues for fiscal year was the addition of  active customer meters  or percent 
fiscal year also benefited from the favorable effect of the november rate changes implemented in maryland and the district of columbia  and the effect of approximately one and one half months of the rate decision that became effective in virginia in november revenue taxes  comprised principally of gross receipts taxes  increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
changes in revenue taxes are impacted by changes in the volume of gas sold and delivered and the cost of the natural gas commodity 
although volumes decreased in both fiscal year and  tax rates charged in maryland increased significantly in fiscal year  and in both maryland and the district of columbia during fiscal year the regulated utility is allowed 
table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recovery of these amounts from its customers and  therefore  these increased fees do not affect total net revenues 
gas deliveries  weather and meter statistics years ended september  gas sales and deliveries thousands of therms firm gas sold and delivered gas delivered for others total firm interruptible gas sold and delivered gas delivered for others total interruptible electric generation delivered for others total deliveries degree days actual normal percent colder than normal active customer meters end of period new customer meters added gas service to firm customers 
the level of gas delivered to firm customers is highly sensitive to weather variability as a large portion of the natural gas delivered by washington gas is used for space heating 
the regulated utility s rates are based on normal weather and through the fiscal year ended september   none of the tariffs for the jurisdictions in which the regulated utility has operated had a weather normalization provision refer to the section entitled weather risk included in management s discussion for wgl holdings for changes related to weather normalization provisions 
nonetheless  declining block rates in the regulated utility s maryland and virginia jurisdictions  and the existence of a fixed demand charge in all jurisdictions to collect a portion of revenues  reduce the effect that variations from normal weather have on net revenues 
during the fiscal year ended september   total gas deliveries to firm customers were billion therms  a decrease of million therms  or percent  in deliveries from fiscal year the percent decline in natural gas deliveries to firm customers occurred even though heating degree days were relatively unchanged from the prior fiscal year 
weather for fiscal year was percent colder than normal  as compared to percent colder than normal for fiscal year the decrease in natural gas deliveries to firm customers is due  in part  to warmer weather experienced primarily during the second quarter of fiscal year  the most significant period of washington gas winter heating season 
however  during the current fiscal year particularly in the shoulder months of october and november within the first quarter  and the shoulder months of april and may within the third quarter  washington gas experienced lower natural gas deliveries because the change in heating degree days did not correlate highly with the change in the volume of gas delivered 
the decrease in total gas deliveries for fiscal year was net of the volumes delivered on the percent increase in active customer meters being served during the current fiscal year 

table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during fiscal year  firm therm deliveries decreased percent from fiscal year to billion therms 
this decrease primarily reflects percent warmer weather during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  partially offset by a percent increase in active customer meters being served 
weather for fiscal year was percent colder than normal  as compared to percent colder than normal for fiscal year many customers choose to buy the natural gas commodity from unregulated third party marketers  rather than purchase the natural gas commodity and delivery service from washington gas on a bundled basis 
gas delivered to firm customers but purchased from unregulated third party marketers represented percent of total firm therms delivered during fiscal year  compared to percent and percent delivered during fiscal years and  respectively 
on a per unit basis  washington gas earns the same net revenues from delivering gas for others as it earns from bundled gas sales in which customers purchase both the natural gas commodity and the associated delivery service from washington gas 
therefore  the regulated utility does not experience any loss in net revenues when customers choose to purchase the natural gas commodity from an unregulated third party marketer 
gas service to interruptible customers 
washington gas must curtail or interrupt service to this class of customer when the demand by firm customers exceeds specified levels 
therm deliveries to interruptible customers increased by million therms  or percent  in fiscal year over fiscal year  and increased by million therms  or percent  in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in both fiscal years is attributable to less curtailment of interruptible service due to warmer weather 
the effect on net income of any changes in delivered volumes and prices to the interruptible class is limited by margin sharing arrangements that are included in washington gas rate designs in the district of columbia  in maryland through september   and to a much smaller extent in virginia 
in the district of columbia  washington gas shares a majority of the margins earned on interruptible gas sales and deliveries with firm customers after a gross margin threshold is reached 
a portion of the fixed costs for servicing interruptible customers is collected through the firm customers rate design 
in the virginia jurisdiction  rates for customers using interruptible delivery service are based on a traditional cost of service approach  and washington gas retains all revenues from interruptible delivery service 
however  a few customers have been grandfathered into a bundled sales and delivery service with a previously approved bundled interruptible rate design 
there is some sharing of those revenues with firm customers  but the volumes are small and the amounts of revenues are not material to the financial statements or results of operations 
prior to october   interruptible customers in the maryland jurisdiction had similar margin sharing arrangements  as described above  for interruptible customers in the district of columbia 
effective october   pursuant to implementing a revenue normalization adjustment mechanism approved by the psc of md  rates for interruptible customers in maryland are based on a traditional cost of service approach  and washington gas retains a defined amount above a pre approved margin threshold level refer to the section entitled jurisdictional rates and regulatory matters maryland jurisdiction 
gas service for electric generation 
washington gas sells and or delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in maryland that are each owned by companies independent of wgl holdings 
during fiscal year  deliveries to these customers increased percent over fiscal year levels to million therms  reflecting the increased use by these customers of natural gas primarily due to the higher price of alternative fuels 
during fiscal year  these deliveries decreased percent to million therms compared to fiscal year  reflecting the use by these customers of alternative fuels primarily due to higher natural gas prices 
washington gas shares a significant majority of the margins earned from gas deliveries to these customers with firm customers 
therefore  changes in the volume of interruptible gas deliveries to these customers do not materially affect either net revenues or net income 

table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of gas the regulated utility s cost of natural gas includes both fixed and variable components 
the regulated utility pays fixed costs or demand charges to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas 
the regulated utility pays variable costs  or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself  to natural gas producers 
variations in the utility s cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes  the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms 
under these regulated recovery mechanisms  the regulated utility records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered from customers and included in revenues 
the difference between the firm gas costs paid and the gas costs recovered from customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to customers in future periods 
therefore  increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on net revenues and net income 
revenues can vary widely on an annual basis because of changes in the cost of gas  but such variations will not have any impact on net revenues or net income 
changes in the cost of gas can cause significant variations in the utility s cash provided by or used in operating activities 
the regulated utility receives from or pays to its customers in the district of columbia and virginia  at short term interest rates  carrying costs associated with under or over collected gas costs recovered from its customers 
the commodity costs of gas invoiced to the utility excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to sales made outside of the utility s service territory  referred to as off system sales were  and per therm for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the higher gas costs in fiscal year and reflect higher commodity gas prices associated with greater demand due to colder than normal weather during these years  and the increased price volatility in the wholesale market  as discussed above 
gas costs in fiscal year are expected to be significantly above fiscal year levels as a result of supply interruptions resulting from hurricanes in the gulf coast region in the late summer and early fall of calendar year the increased gas costs are likely to cause an increase in short term interest expense to finance higher accounts receivable balances and higher uncollectible accounts expenses refer to the section entitled gas supply and storage capacity included in management s discussion for wgl holdings for a further discussion of this matter 
utility operating expenses operation and maintenance expenses 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or percent  from fiscal year to fiscal year  and increased million  or percent  from fiscal year to fiscal year the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in operation and maintenance expenses 
composition of operation and maintenance expense changes increase decrease compared to prior year in millions labor and incentive plans employee severance employee benefits  excluding the medicare subsidy medicare subsidy uncollectible accounts other non labor operating expenses total 
table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued expenses related to labor and incentive plans increased million in fiscal year  and decreased  in fiscal year the current year increase in this expense was due primarily to increased employee base pay and increased incentive pay accruals related to performance based incentive awards  coupled with increased overtime incurred in connection with response to issues that arose in a portion of the company s distribution system in prince george s county  maryland  such as special leak surveys  emergency response site visits and repairs 
partially mitigating this increased expense was the effect of percent fewer employees in fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year also benefited million from reduced employee severance costs that were incurred in fiscal year related to operational efficiencies at the regulated utility 
the  decline in labor and incentive plan expenses for fiscal year primarily reflects eight percent fewer employees 
the million increase in employee benefits expenses in fiscal year when compared to was largely related to increased post retirement benefit costs 
in fiscal year  employee benefits increased million over fiscal year largely due to an increase in the cost of group medical insurance 
in fiscal year  the company recognized a benefit of million  representing a cost reduction associated with a medicare prescription drug subsidy 
this subsidy resulted from a law enacted in december that entitles the company to a federal subsidy for sponsoring a retiree health care benefit plan with a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit to be provided under medicare 
fiscal year reflects increased benefits recognized in connection with this subsidy 
the million increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts for fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices 
the million decrease in fiscal year was driven by improved collection efforts by the regulated utility  as well as warmer weather compared to fiscal year other non labor operating expenses for fiscal year decreased  in fiscal year from  and increased million in fiscal year over in fiscal year  the company reversed the remaining excess accrual that was previously recorded in fiscal year associated with unusual operational expenses  which resulted in a million favorable year over year comparison 
this benefit was offset by million of higher expenses associated with performing the initial assessment of internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as increased expense related to other miscellaneous items 
fiscal year included the accrual of million recorded in connection with unusual operational expenses  million associated with information technology improvements  and other miscellaneous items 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year fell to million  a decrease of million  or percent  from fiscal year the lower expense is attributable  in part  to a reversal in the current fiscal year of million of depreciation expense that was previously estimated and recorded in fiscal year related to the performance of an earnings test required by a virginia rate order 
the decline in this expense in fiscal year  when compared to  is also due to the inclusion in fiscal year of depreciation expense of million pre tax  applicable to the period from january  through november   that was recorded in connection with the virginia rate order refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s regulatory activities and related contingencies 
the year over year reduction in this expense was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense in the current fiscal year related to an increased investment in property  plant and equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year rose to million  an increase of million  or percent  over fiscal year this increase reflects increased investment in property  plant and equipment  as well as the recording in fiscal year of million pre tax of depreciation expense pursuant to a virginia rate order as discussed in the preceding paragraph and million of depreciation expense related to the earnings test also discussed above 
the regulated utility s composite depreciation and amortization rate was percent for fiscal years and  and percent for fiscal year 
table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued general taxes 
general taxes increased by million in fiscal year over  and decreased by million in fiscal year from the increased expense in fiscal year was attributable to a new sales and use tax assessment in virginia  increased real and personal property taxes in maryland  and other miscellaneous items 
the new virginia tax assessment primarily represents a surcharge that is collected from virginia customers  and thereby does not materially affect net income 
the decreased expense in fiscal year from fiscal year was due primarily to lower right of way fees that are collected on a per therm basis  principally in the district of columbia  and that are impacted by changes in volumes of gas sold and delivered 
income taxes 
income taxes for the regulated utility decreased million in fiscal year when compared to primarily due to a combination of lower pre tax income and a lower effective income tax rate 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate  from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  is primarily attributable to a favorable tax adjustment of million recorded in the fourth quarter  coupled with increased non taxable benefits associated with the medicare prescription drug subsidy 
the million decrease in fiscal year over primarily reflects lower pre tax income  a lower effective income tax rate attributable to the medicare subsidy  partially offset by an adjustment of million that reduced income tax expense in fiscal year other income expenses net other income expenses net reflects other net expenses of million for the fiscal year ended september   as compared to other net income of million for the fiscal year ended september  the million of increased expense in fiscal year was attributable primarily to reduced allocations in the current fiscal year of non operating tax benefits from wgl holdings to washington gas 
these allocations are made in accordance with the tax sharing agreement under which washington gas and all other subsidiaries of wgl holdings participate 
wgl holdings consolidated financial statements do not reflect the effect of such allocations since they are eliminated in consolidation 
favorably affecting fiscal year was increased interest income earned on higher average short term investment balances and yields
