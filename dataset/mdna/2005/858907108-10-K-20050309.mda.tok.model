item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note regulatory matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
imposition of liability for undercapitalized subsidiaries 
a bank holding company that fails to meet the applicable risk based capital standards will be at a disadvantage 
for example  federal reserve board policy discourages the payment of dividends by a bank holding company from borrowed funds as well as payments that would adversely affect capital adequacy 
failure to meet the capital guidelines may result in the issuance of supervisory or enforcement actions by the federal reserve board 
fdicia requires bank regulators to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels 
acquisitions by bank holding companies 
the bhca requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting shares of such bank 
in approving bank acquisitions  the federal reserve board considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned the convenience and needs of the communities to be served  and various competitive factors 
the attorney general of the united states may  within days after approval of an acquisition by the federal reserve board  bring an action challenging such acquisition under the federal antitrust laws  in which case the effectiveness of such approval is stayed pending a final ruling by the courts 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act of cra and the regulations promulgated by the fdic to implement cra are intended to ensure that banks meet the credit needs of their service area  including low and moderate income communities and individuals  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra regulations also require the banking regulatory authorities to evaluate a bank s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish new offices or consummate any merger or acquisition transaction 
under firrea  the federal banking agencies are required to rate each insured institution s performance under cra and to make such information publicly available 
in the case of an acquisition by a bank holding company  the cra performance records of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed as part of the processing of the acquisition application 
a cra rating other than outstanding or satisfactory can substantially delay or block a transaction 
based upon our most recent cra examination the bank has a satisfactory cra rating 
interstate banking 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate branching act increased the ease and likelihood of interstate branching throughout much of the united states 
the interstate branching act removes state law barriers to acquisitions in all states and allows multi state banking operations to merge into a single bank with interstate branches 
interstate banking and branching authority is subject to certain conditions and restrictions  such as capital adequacy  management and cra compliance 
the interstate branching act preempts existing barriers that restrict entry into all states  such as regional compacts and reciprocal agreements  thus creating opportunities for expansion into markets that were previously closed 
under the interstate branching act  bank holding companies are now able to acquire banks in any state  subject to certain conditions 
banks acquired pursuant to this authority may subsequently be converted to branches 
interstate branching is permitted by allowing banks to merge across state lines to form a single institution 
interstate merger transactions can be used to consolidate existing multi state operations or to acquire new branches 
a bank may establish a new branch as its initial entry into a state only if the state has authorized de novo branching 
in addition  out of state banks may merge with a single branch of a bank if the state has authorized such a transaction 
the federal reserve board  however  will only allow the acquisition by a bank holding company of an 
table of contents interest in any bank located in another state if the statutory laws of the state in which the target bank is located expressly authorize such acquisitions 
texas elected to opt out of the interstate branching act 
despite having opted out of the interstate branching act  the texas banking act permits  in certain circumstances  out of state bank holding companies to acquire certain existing banks and bank holding companies in texas 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act is intended to increase corporate responsibility  to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to securities laws 
the sarbanes oxley act is the most far reaching us securities legislation enacted in some time 
it generally applies to all companies  both us and us  that file or are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the exchange act 
the sarbanes oxley act includes additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules  requires the sec and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure  corporate governance and other related rules and mandates further studies of certain issues by the sec 
the sarbanes oxley act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 
the sarbanes oxley act addresses  among other matters audit committees for all listed companies  certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer  the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement due to material noncompliance of the issuer or misconduct  a prohibition on insider trading during pension plan black out periods  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers except for financial institutions  expedited filing requirements for form s  disclosure of a code of ethics  if applicable  and filing a form k for a change or waiver of such code  accelerated filing of periodic reports  the formation of a public accounting oversight board  auditor independence  and increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
sterling bank sterling bank is a texas chartered banking association and its deposits are insured  up to applicable limits  by the bank insurance fund of the fdic 
the bank is subject to supervision and regulation by both the texas department of banking and the fdic and may be subject to special restrictions  supervisory requirements and potential enforcement actions 
the bank is not a member of the federal reserve system  however  the federal reserve board also has supervisory authority that indirectly affects 
table of contents the bank 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank and  therefore  is subject also to compliance with its requirements 
permissible activities for state chartered institutions 
the texas constitution provides that a texas chartered bank has the same rights and privileges that are granted to national banks domiciled in texas 
however  fdicia provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as principal in any activity not permitted for national banks  unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the fdic determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the bank insurance fund bif 
branching 
texas law provides that a texas chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in texas provided that the branch is approved in advance by the commissioner of the texas department of banking the commissioner 
the branch must also be approved by the fdic  which considers a number of factors  including financial history  capital adequacy  earnings prospects  character of management  needs of the community  and consistency with corporate powers 
there are no federal limitations on the ability of insured non member state banks to branch across state lines  however  such branching would be subject to applicable state law restrictions 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 
transactions between the bank and its nonbanking affiliates  including sterling bancshares  are subject to section a of the federal reserve act and regulation w promulgated thereunder 
section a defines covered transactions  which include extensions of credit  and limits a bank s covered transactions with any affiliate to ten percent of such bank s capital and surplus 
all covered and exempt transactions between a bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and banks and their subsidiaries are prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from the bank s affiliates 
finally  section a requires that all of a bank s extensions of credit to its affiliates be appropriately secured by acceptable collateral 
affiliate transactions are also subject to section b of the federal reserve act which generally requires that covered and other transactions between the bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at that time for comparable transactions with or involving other non affiliated persons 
the restrictions on loans to directors  executive officers  principal shareholders and their related interests collectively  the insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies 
these restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made 
there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests 
these loans cannot exceed the institution s total unimpaired capital and surplus  and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate 
insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions 
capital adequacy requirements 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the fdic and the texas department of banking 
the fdic may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
the fdic s risk based capital guidelines generally require state banks to have a minimum ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets of and a ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of 
the fdic s leverage guidelines require state banks to maintain tier capital of not less than of average total assets  except in the case of certain highly rated banks for which the requirement is of average total assets 
the texas banking department has issued a policy which generally requires state chartered banks to maintain a leverage ratio defined in accordance with federal capital guidelines of 

table of contents corrective measures for capital deficiencies 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to capital deficient institutions 
agency regulations define  for each capital category  the levels at which institutions are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a well capitalized bank has a total risk based capital ratio of or higher  a tier risk based capital ratio of or higher  a leverage ratio of or higher  and is not subject to any written agreement  order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital ratio for any capital measure 
an adequately capitalized bank has a total risk based capital ratio of or higher  a tier risk based capital ratio of or higher  a leverage ratio of or higher or higher if the bank was rated a composite in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth 
a bank is undercapitalized if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized 
the company believes that as of december   the bank was well capitalized based on the guidelines and ratios for purposes of the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
in addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan  agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth  acquisition  branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business 
with certain exceptions  an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions  including dividends  and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment 
as an institution s capital decreases  the fdic s enforcement powers become more severe 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities  restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates  removal of management and other restrictions 
the fdic has only very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator 
banks with risk based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions  including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing  or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital 
for information regarding the capital ratios of the bank see the discussion under the section captioned capital resources included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note regulatory matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
brokered deposit restrictions 
firrea and fdicia generally limit institutions that are not well capitalized from accepting brokered deposits 
in general  undercapitalized institutions may not solicit  accept or renew brokered deposits 
adequately capitalized institutions may not solicit  accept or renew brokered deposits unless they obtain a waiver from the fdic 
even in that event  the institution must comply with rate limitations imposed by the federal deposit insurance act 
restrictions on subsidiary banks 
dividends paid by the bank provided substantially all of sterling bancshares cash flow during and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
under federal law  a bank may not pay a dividend that results in an undercapitalized situation 
at december   there was an aggregate of approximately million available for the payment of dividends by the bank to sterling bancshares 
other requirements in texas law affecting the operation of subsidiary banks include requirements relating to maintenance of reserves against deposits  restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and limitations relating to investments and other activities 
examinations 
the fdic periodically examines and evaluates insured banks 
fdic examinations are conducted every months 
the fdic may  however  accept the result of a texas department of banking examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination 
fdicia authorizes the fdic to assess the institution for its costs of conducting the examinations 

table of contents the texas banking commissioner also conducts examinations annually  unless additional examinations are deemed necessary to safeguard the interests of shareholders  depositors and creditors 
the commissioner may accept the results of a federal examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination 
however  since the bank s total assets exceed billion  the fdic and the texas department of banking conduct a joint examination on an annual basis 
audit reports 
insured institutions with total assets of million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by an independent registered public accounting firm to federal and state regulators 
in some instances  the audit report of the institution s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement 
in addition  financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements  internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the fdic  and an attestation by the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted 
for certain institutions with total assets of more than billion  an independent registered public accounting firm may be required to review quarterly financial statements 
fdicia requires that independent audit committees be formed  consisting solely of outside directors 
committees must include members with experience in banking or financial management  must have access to outside counsel  and must not include representatives of large customers 
our audit committee is comprised solely of outside directors with at least one certified public accountant designated as a financial expert 
deposit insurance assessments 
the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums on all banks in order to adequately fund the bif so as to resolve any insured institution that is declared insolvent by its primary regulator 
the fdic has established a risk based deposit insurance premium system to calculate a depository institution s semi annual deposit insurance assessment 
the fdic s semi annual assessment is based upon the designated reserve ratio for the bif and the probability and extent to which the bif will incur a loss with respect to the institution 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments to cover the cost of borrowings from the us treasury  the federal financing bank  and bif member banks 
the fdic may adjust the assessment rate schedule twice a year without seeking prior public comment  but only within a range of five cents per above or below the premium schedule adopted 
the fdic can make changes in the rate schedule outside the five cent range above or below the current schedule only after a full rulemaking with opportunity for public comment 
expanding enforcement authority 
one of the major additional impacts imposed by fdicia is the increased ability of banking regulators to monitor the activities of banks and their holding companies 
the federal reserve board and fdic have extensive authority to police unsafe or unsound practices and violations of applicable laws and regulations by depository institutions and their holding companies 
for example  the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that it determines has engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice 
the agencies can also assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist or removal orders  seek injunctions  and publicly disclose such actions 
fdicia  firrea and other laws have expanded the agencies authority in recent years  and the agencies have not yet fully tested the limits of their powers 
effect on economic environment 
the policies of regulatory authorities  including the monetary policy of the federal reserve board  have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
among the means available to the federal reserve board to affect the money supply are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
these means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits  and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
federal reserve board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our business and earnings cannot be predicted 

table of contents consumer laws and regulations 
banks are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
among the more prominent of such laws and regulations are the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the fair housing act and consumer privacy protection provisions of the gramm leach bliley 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
we must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of our ongoing customer relations

overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provides insight into important areas of management s focus 
this introduction highlights selected information in this report and may not contain all of the information that is important to you 
for a more complete understanding of trends  events  commitments  liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting estimates  you should carefully read this entire report 
this section should also be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our success is highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates 
because we operate primarily in houston  and to a lesser extent  in the dallas and san antonio metropolitan areas  the local economic conditions of these areas are particularly important 
the houston and texas economies continued to improve during and we remain fairly optimistic that our internal growth and related credit quality should steadily improve going forward 
we are seeing improved results in our customer s financial condition  including increases in their backlogs and improved liquidity and profitability in their financial statements 
in addition  local economists are predicting that job growth in key sectors such as energy and manufacturing should increase in houston during during the first half of  we undertook a significant effort related to improving asset quality 
with subsequent overall asset quality improvements  we were able to further focus our efforts toward loan growth  the further development of our new and existing customer base  as well as the redeployment of our capital in the second half of during  we implemented an expense management initiative whereby numerous expense reduction and alignment projects were identified including the consolidation of smaller offices  disposition of unprofitable initiatives  modification of certain perquisite benefit programs and continued reductions of staffing levels through attrition 
these projects are expected to reduce our non interest expense base and 
table of contents allow for greater control of expense growth in as part of this initiative  we terminated two consulting contracts and closed one unprofitable banking facility 
these combined two initiatives are expected to save approximately million annually beginning in we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
each of these financial instruments reacts differently to interest rates 
during  the federal reserve bank increased overnight interest rates a total of basis points beginning in june prior to these increases  interest rates were near year lows 
while we are impacted significantly by the size and timing of short term rate increases  as well as the shape of the yield curve and other competitive factors  our balance sheet is generally positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment 
there are several factors impacting comparisons of our financial statements for to earlier years 
these factors should be kept in mind when considering our future prospects as well sale of scmc divestitures of banking offices acquisition of plaza bank during and  we made several decisions designed to more clearly align our operations with our long term vision and strategy 
in we made the strategic decision to divest of scmc in order to better position us to focus our efforts on the commercial banking needs of small to mid sized businesses 
we have used the net proceeds of the sale to support our ongoing internal growth 
scmc s operations were reported previously as the company s mortgage banking segment  which is reported together with the net gain on sale as discontinued operations 
other areas of our financial statements affected by the sale of scmc are not as easily highlighted 
as a banking operation  the bank benefited by providing scmc with a warehouse line of credit which financed mortgage loans held for sale 
additionally  scmc maintained operating and escrow deposits with the bank reducing the bank s other borrowing needs 
due to decisions made by the buyer of scmc  the bank lost the benefit of these loans and deposit balances shortly after completing the sale of scmc in september in  we closed one of our banking offices and merged its operations into another location 
we retained substantially all of the loans and deposits associated with this location 
in  we sold five banking offices acquired as part of previous acquisitions 
these five banking offices were located in eagle pass  pearsall  crystal city  carrizo springs and highlands  texas and were sold because their operations and growth potential did not align with our business banking strategy of serving small and mid sized businesses in the major metropolitan areas 
finally  acquisitions we made will not only affect comparisons with previous periods  but also our future prospects 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of south texas capital group  inc of san antonio and its subsidiary bank  plaza bank 
critical accounting policies an understanding of our accounting policies is important to an understanding of our reported results 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses incurred on loans 
loans are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for credit losses and credited to the allowance for credit losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb losses 
management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans involves the consideration of 
table of contents current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential credit losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond our control 
please refer to the subsequent discussion of allowance for credit losses below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method 
because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized on options granted 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is based on the market price of the stock on the date of grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share assuming the fair value based accounting method in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment revised  on july  among other things  sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value based method of accounting and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
sfas r is effective on july  sfas r will require that management make assumptions related to our stock price volatility and employee turnover that are utilized to measure compensation expense 
results of operations performance summary net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share earned for and million  or per diluted share earned for income from continuing operations was equal to reported net income in  while income from continuing operations totaled million  or per diluted share for and million  or per diluted share for net income for and included discontinued operations related to the sale of scmc which was sold in income from continuing operations for decreased million compared to this decrease was primarily due to decreases during in both net interest income and other income of million and million  respectively  and an increase in total noninterest expense of million 
these changes were offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses of million and lower provision for income taxes of million 
net income for included total after tax net gains on the sales of securities of million  or per diluted share  impairment charges on certain bank assets totaling million  or per diluted share  net of taxes and contract termination charges of thousand  or per diluted share  net of taxes 
we also reduced income tax expense during by million  or per diluted share as a result of the expiration of previous tax contingencies and refunds received 
income from continuing operations for the period included after tax net gains on the sales of rural banking offices of million  or per diluted share 
income from continuing operations for decreased million compared to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in net interest income of million  an increase in the provision for credit losses of million  offset by an increase in noninterest income of million due primarily to the gain on sales of rural banking offices discussed above 

table of contents two commonly used industry measures of a banking institution s performance are return on average assets and return on average common equity 
return on average assets roa measures net income in relation to average total assets and is an indicator of a company s ability to employ its resources profitably 
for  our roa from continuing operations was  as compared to and for and  respectively 
return on average common equity roe measures net income in relation to average common equity and is an indicator of a company s return to its owners 
for  our roe from continuing operations was compared to and for and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including loans and securities  exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
the federal reserve board significantly influences market interest rates  including rates offered for loans and deposits by many financial institutions 
generally  when the federal reserve board changes the target overnight interest rate charged by banks  the market responds with a similar change in the prime lending rate 
our loan portfolio is impacted significantly by changes in short term interest rates 
during the fourth quarter of  the federal reserve board decreased overnight interest rates by basis points from to 
during the second quarter of  overnight interest rates decreased an additional basis points to 
during this period  market interest rates were near year lows 
this extended period of declining and then low interest rates negatively impacted our net interest margin and net interest income during these periods 
beginning in june the federal reserve board began increasing overnight interest rates for a combined increase of basis points to a fed funds target rate of at december  since our balance sheet is asset sensitive  our interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than the interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin began to improve during the second half of following these increases in interest rates 
net interest income for was million  down million or from million for interest income decreased million due to a decrease in average interest earning assets and a nine basis point decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets 
this was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of million compared to  resulting from a decrease in average interest bearing liabilities and a decrease in average yield paid on interest bearing liabilities of six basis points 
net interest income and margin were primarily impacted by the sale of scmc and the changes in interest rates as discussed above 
during  net interest income decreased million or from million earned for this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in yields on loans  securities and deposits due to decreases in interest rates discussed above offset by increases in volumes 
average interest earning assets decreased million or in compared to the average yield earned on interest earning assets decreased nine basis points in compared to these decreases resulted in part from a decrease in average loans held for sale of million compared to average loans held for sale for included million related to the mortgage warehouse we financed for our mortgage banking operation 
on september   we completed the sale of our mortgage banking operations and we lost the benefit of the mortgage warehouse shortly after completing the sale when the buyer decided to pay off this credit facility 
the decrease in interest income resulting from lower loan volumes was offset somewhat by additional investments in investment securities with lower yields than that of the mortgage warehouse 
average interest earning assets increased million or during compared to these increases were primarily due to growth in loans held for investment which increased on average million and an increase in average investments on securities of million 
the average yield on

on average  the securities portfolio was higher by million or for compared to and million or for as compared with as mentioned above  the average yields on these securities were less than the yield previously earned on the mortgage warehouse credit facility

the decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities helped offset the impact of declining yields on interest earning assets 
competitive pressures often limit our ability to reduce rates on deposits by the same amount as that of loans during periods of declining rates 
our net interest margin was for compared to for and for the decrease of three basis points from to was primarily attributable to the payoff of the higher yielding mortgage warehouse credit facility and declines in market interest rates that occurred prior to these declines were partially offset by increases in overnight interest rates during the last half of overall  the net interest margin decreased basis points from to certain average balances  together with the total dollar amounts of interest income and expense and the average interest yield rates are included below

table of contents asset quality risk elements our nonperforming and past due loans are substantially collateralized by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for credit losses 
on an ongoing basis  we receive updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses 
potential problem loans are those loans not classified as nonperforming  but where information known by management indicates serious doubt that the borrower will be able to comply with the present payment terms 
management identifies these loans through its ongoing loan review process 
as of december   potential problem loans decreased million to million at december  from million at december  nonperforming assets and potential problem loans consisted of the following in thousands nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans foreclosed assets real estate acquired by foreclosure other repossessed assets total foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to period end loans nonperforming assets to period end assets nonperforming assets to total period end loans and foreclosed assets potential problem loans accruing loans past due days or more nonperforming assets were million at december   down million or from million at year end the decrease was primary the result of our efforts to improve asset quality during during the first quarter of  we sold million of nonperforming loans which increased charge offs by million 
we had provided for the losses on these nonperforming loans during previous periods and decided to sell these loans to minimize further loss exposure 
interest foregone on nonaccrual loans was approximately million during at december   we had three large nonperforming relationships that were placed on nonaccrual status during the second half of these relationships individually were larger than million 
two of these nonperforming relationships were returned to performing status during the first half of the third of these relationships was partially charged off during the remainder of this relationship was paid off in the third quarter of management implemented more stringent credit approval standards for relationships of large size loans in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents accruing loans past due days or more at december  totaled million compared to thousand at december  the balance at december  included loans to one borrower totaling million which were in the process of being paid off at year end 
allowance for credit losses the provision for credit losses decreased million from million for to million for during  we incurred net charge offs of million or of average loans 
the provision for credit losses and net charge offs for were impacted by the partial charge off of one of the three problem loan relationships previously discussed 
a total of million was charged off during the fourth quarter of in conjunction with this relationship 
during  net charge offs were million or of average loans 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making our evaluation  we consider the industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
we also consider the results of recent regulatory examinations  our history of credit experience and our ongoing internal credit reviews 
we continually monitor economic conditions in our local market areas and the probable impact on borrowers  past due amounts  related collateral values  the number and size of non performing loans and on the resulting amount of charge offs for the period 
we have several systems and procedures in place to assist in managing the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
in addition to established underwriting guidelines and approval processes  we monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
we also perform reviews of the loan portfolios on a regular basis to identify troubled loans and to assess their overall probability of collection 
ongoing portfolio reviews are conducted by our internal loan review department under an established loan review program 
annually  we target a loan review penetration of at least of the total commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
through the loan review process  we maintain an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps us assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans on this listing are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss based on probability of repayment  collateral valuation and related collectibility 
loans classified as substandard have clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize the loan s recoverability 
loans classified as doubtful have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur or that at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
at december   substandard loans totaled million  of which million were loans designated as delinquent or nonaccrual  and doubtful loans totaled million all of which were designated as delinquent or nonaccrual 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  we maintain a separate watch list which further aids in monitoring the loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements  deficiencies that require attention in the short run  or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared 
table of contents with those of a satisfactory credit 
we review these loans in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   watch list loans totaled million 
management assigns loan grades by individual loan and allocations are made within each loan grade 
loans are assigned a grade according to payment history  collateral values  and financial condition of the borrower 
the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses through its watchlist classifications  allocating an increasing reserve amount as the severity of a problem loan increases 
the bank maintains an unallocated reserve for satisfactory non classified credits based  in part  on the average of the last three year s actual net charge offs

an interest sensitive asset or liability is one that experiences changes in cashflows as a direct result of changes in market interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk  remaining mindful of the relationship between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies for the management of interest rate risk are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we measure interest rate risk using a variety of methodologies including  but not limited to  dynamic simulation analysis  gap analysis and static balance sheet rate shocks 
dynamic simulation analysis is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk 
we model the effects of non parallel movements in multiple yield curves  changes in borrower and depositor behaviors  changes in loan and deposit pricing  and changes in loan and deposit portfolio compositions and growth rates over a month horizon 
a gap analysis measures maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time 
a bank is considered asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a bank is considered liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period

each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
because of uncertainties related to customer behaviors  loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor behaviors  and socio economic factors that could affect the shape of the yield curves  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the company 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market factors 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the affect actual changes in market rates will have on the company 
a number of factors have affected the change in the simulations from to among these are loan pricing assumptions that have resulted from the flattening of the yield curve as well as competitive pressures 
additionally  the composition of our loan  deposit  and securities portfolios has changed over this time period 
the objectives of our liquidity management is to maintain our ability to meet day to day deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to raise funds to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
we strive to manage a liquidity position sufficient to meet operating requirements while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the expectations of our shareholders 
in recent years  our liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits 
in addition to core deposits  we have access to funds from correspondent banks and from the federal home loan bank  supplemented by amortizing securities and loan portfolios 
the bank also accepts brokered certificates of deposit 
sterling bancshares must provide for its own liquidity and fund its own obligations 
the primary source of sterling bancshares revenues is from dividends declared by the bank

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following risks may affect us 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the nation  the houston metropolitan area and  to a lesser extent  that of the san antonio and dallas metropolitan areas 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the market areas in which we operate 
the local economic conditions of these areas have a significant impact on our commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  such as inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  an outbreak of hostilities  unemployment and other factors beyond our control will impact these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
in addition  houston remains largely dependent on the energy industry 
a downturn in the energy industry and energy related business could indirectly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on an owner operated business market 
our business development and marketing strategy primarily targets the banking and financial needs of owner operated businesses with credit needs of under million 
these owner operated businesses represent a major sector of the houston and national economies 
if general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the metropolitan areas in which we operate  our results of operations and financial condition will be significantly affected 
if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
we may experience significant credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the size of the allowance  we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio 
significant additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 

table of contents in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those we make 
any increase in our allowance or charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative affect on us 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
we are unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by the following factors inflation  recession  a rise in unemployment  tightening money supply  international disorder  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
our asset liability management strategy  which is designed to address the risk from changes in market interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  may not prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
we face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions  including savings institutions  finance companies and credit unions 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits  larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies and insurance companies 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we face competition primarily from other banks in attracting  developing and retaining qualified banking professionals 
we may not be able to maintain our historical growth rate which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
to implement our growth strategy  we have initiated internal growth programs  completed various acquisitions and opened additional offices in the past few years 
we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow at all 
we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable candidates for acquisition 
various factors  such as economic conditions and competition  may impede or prohibit the opening of new branch offices 
further  our inability to attract and retain experienced bankers may adversely affect our internal growth 
a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may be unable to complete acquisitions  and once complete  may not be able to integrate our acquisitions successfully 
our growth strategy includes our desire to acquire other financial institutions 
we may not be able to complete any future acquisitions and  if completed  we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations  management  products and services of the entities we acquire 
following each acquisition  we must expend substantial managerial  operating  financial and other resources to integrate these entities 
in particular  we may be required to install and standardize adequate operational and control systems  deploy or modify equipment  implement marketing efforts in new as well as existing locations and employ and maintain qualified personnel 
our failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our operations 
additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers  authority and operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us
