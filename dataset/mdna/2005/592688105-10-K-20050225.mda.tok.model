we supply automatic identification and data capture solutions  which integrate in motion weighing  dimensioning and identification technologies for transport  shipping and logistics customers 
we also offer heavy industrial scales and related software 
the industrial instruments business accounted for approximately of our net sales in industrial weighing instruments we offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances  such as bench scales and floor scales  for weighing loads from a few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing mail and packages 
our products are used in a wide range of applications  such as counting applications and in formulating and mixing ingredients 
industrial terminals our industrial scale terminals integrate collected data and control and automate manufacturing processes 
they allow users to remotely download programs or access setup data and can minimize down time through predictive rather than reactive maintenance 
transportation shipping and logistics we are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and data capture solutions  which integrate in motion weighing  dimensioning and identification technologies 
with these solutions  customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of packages for appropriate billing  logistics and quality control

in addition  our q 
i software controls batching processes by monitoring the material transfer control process 
q 
i also provides statistical  diagnostic and operational information for asset management  process control and database applications 
product inspection increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more and more sophisticated end of line inspection systems eg  for use in food processing and packaging  and pharmaceutical and other industries 
we are the world s leading provider of metal detectors  x ray visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries 
metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself 
x ray based vision inspection helps detect non metallic contamination  such as glass  stones and pits  which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons 
our x ray systems can detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control 
both x ray and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging 
table of contents lines 
checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food  pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 
freeweigh 
net is our statistical and quality control software that optimizes package filling  monitors weight related data and integrates it in real time into customers enterprise resource planning and or process control systems 
retail weighing solutions supermarkets  hypermarkets and other food retail organizations make use of multiple weighing applications for handling fresh goods such as meats  vegetables  fruits and cheeses 
we offer stand alone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing  price finding and printing 
in addition  we offer network scales and software  which can integrate backroom  counter  self service and checkout functions and can incorporate weighing data into a supermarket s overall fresh goods management system 
customer benefits are in the areas of pricing  merchandising  inventory management  and regulatory compliance 
the retail business accounted for approximately of our net sales in retail software our subsidiary softechnics provides retail software for in store item and inventory management solutions 
softechnics offering complements our solutions to food retailers 
its software provides the full scope of real time item management  thereby allowing retailers to match local store inventory levels with local customer demand 
as our traditional retail weighing business become more focused on information technology  the opportunity to cross sell softechnics software and services expands 
we have begun to introduce softechnics software for the improved management of fresh goods and plan to sell more integrated data management solutions for fresh goods now and in the future 
customers and distribution our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies  as well as independent research organizations  food producers  food retailers  the beverage industry  specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies  the transportation and logistics industry  the metals industry  the electronics industry  and the academic market 
our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels 
generally  more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force  while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels 
our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels 
a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through the indirect channels 
we have a diversified customer base  with no single customer accounting for more than of net sales 
sales and service market organizations we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service 
the market organizations are local marketing and service organizations designed to maintain close relationships with our customers 
each market organization has the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions 
market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas 
we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers 
at december   our sales and services group consisted of over  employees in sales  marketing and customer service including related administration and post sales technical service  located in countries 
this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe 
this is important because our customers are seeking to do more and more business with a consistent global approach 

table of contents service we have expanded our service business from one centered on calibration  repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance and other value added services  which we call service xxl 
we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in assuring that our instruments are used in compliance with fda regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the customer s location throughout the world 
this global service network also is an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets 
we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world 
in  service representing service contracts  repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
a significant portion of this amount is derived from replacement parts 
beyond revenue opportunities  we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention 
the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 
research and development and manufacturing producing organizations our research  product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations which specialize in specific products on a global basis 
our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs  improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership 
the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices  and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 
research and development we intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications 
over the last three years  we have invested million in research and development million in  million in  and million in 
in  we spent approximately of net sales on research and development 
our research and development efforts fall into two categories technology advancements  which increase the value of our products 
these advancements may be in the form of enhanced functionality  new applications for our technologies  more accurate or reliable measurement  additional software capability or automation through robotics or other means  and cost reductions  which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design 
we have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and development budget to software development 
this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments  application specific software  and software that connects our solutions into customers it systems 
we closely integrate research and development with marketing  manufacturing and product engineering 
we have over employees in research and development and product engineering 
manufacturing we are a worldwide manufacturer  with facilities principally in the united states  switzerland  germany  the united kingdom and china 
laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china  while our remaining products are produced worldwide 
we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations  and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications 
we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process 
all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso certification 
we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated needs 
we generally manufacture only critical components ourselves  usually components that contain proprietary technology 
when outside manufacturing is more efficient  we contract with others for certain components 
we use a wide range of suppliers 
we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate and that there are no material 
table of contents constraints on the sources and availability of materials 
from time to time we rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component 
supply arrangements for electronics are generally made globally 
backlog  seasonality our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products  which helps to limit inventory costs 
backlog is therefore generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 
our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation  particularly the high end laboratory instruments business 
traditionally  sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than  and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than  sales in the second and third quarters 
fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately of our sales 
this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees throughout the world  including approximately  in europe   in north and south america  and  in asia and other countries 
we believe our employee relations are good  and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years  except for a strike in early at our bethune  france facility  which has been closed 
labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 
intellectual property we hold over  patents and trademarks  primarily in the united states  switzerland  germany  the united kingdom  france  japan and china 
our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations  some of which are protected by patents of various durations 
products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents  and as a result  no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business 
we have numerous trademarks  including the mettler toledo name and logo  which are material to our business 
we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 
regulation our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities 
all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 
approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments  and are themselves not affected by other instruments 
in addition  some of our products are used in legal for trade applications  in which prices based on weight are calculated  and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required 
although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets  there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards  and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 
our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end user and market 
for example  laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp  industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp  pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations  and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations 
products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our competitors  we have 
table of contents incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad 
our subsidiary hi speed checkweigher co  inc hi speed is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain remedial actions under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep signed on june  with respect to certain property in landing  new jersey 
gei international corporation gei is the other ordered party 
gei has failed to fulfil all its obligations under the njdep order  and hi speed has recently entered into discussions with the njdep about the next steps to be undertaken as a result 
njdep has agreed with hi speed that the residual contaminants can be addressed through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site 
the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures  but rather as institutional controls that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated 
we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site will be approximately million over the next seven years 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
accordingly  although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to material environmental liabilities in the future 
competition our markets are highly competitive 
weighing and analytical instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the industrial and food retailing markets 
as a result  we face numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of which are well established in their markets 
in addition  some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own 
taken together  the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices 
although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors  we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 
these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions  our global brand and reputation  our track record of technological innovation  our comprehensive  high quality solution offering  our global sales and service offering  our large installed base of weighing instruments  and the fact that our revenue base is diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying  developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself  application support  service support and price 
in emerging markets  where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products  price is a more important factor than in developed markets 
competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well 

table of contents factors affecting our future operating results we have substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt  which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 
we have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately million  net of cash of million 
we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness  subject to the restrictions therein 
our debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  product development and other corporate requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  including changes in raw material costs  limit our ability to respond to business opportunities  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  which may be necessary  and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants  which  if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured  could result in an event of default under our debt 
to service our debt  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to an extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors  including those described in this section  that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt  including our senior credit facility and the senior notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 
the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our senior credit facility contain a number of covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business 
these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
the restrictions these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback arrangements  incur liens  and consolidate  merge  sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets 
our senior credit facility also requires us to meet several financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  and are subject to the risks in this section 
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the senior notes or under our senior credit facility 
an event of default under our senior credit facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts 
table of contents borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable 
acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 
currency fluctuations may affect our operating profits 
because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
accordingly  the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross rate monitored by the company 
we estimate that a strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
based on our outstanding debt at december   we estimate that a weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets 
we conduct business in many countries  including emerging markets in asia  latin america and eastern europe 
in addition to the currency risks discussed above  international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us 
for instance  various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks tariffs and trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  and or mandatory salary increases for local employees  credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  nationalization of private enterprises  restrictions on investments and or limitations regarding foreign ownership  adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and uncertain local economic  political and social conditions  including hyper inflationary conditions  or periods of low or no productivity growth 
we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies 
for example  converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals 
if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations  we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 
economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time deteriorated significantly  and some emerging markets are experiencing recessionary trends  severe currency devaluations and inflationary prices 
moreover  economic problems in individual markets can spread to other economies  adding to the adverse conditions we face in emerging markets 
we remain committed to emerging markets  particularly those in asia  latin america and eastern europe 
however  we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will affect our results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable future 

table of contents we operate in highly competitive markets  and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins  gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 
our markets are highly competitive 
weighing and analytical instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the industrial and food retailing markets 
as a result  we face numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of whom are well established in their markets 
in addition  some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our company 
taken together  the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices 
although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 
our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 
we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner  or our products could become technologically obsolete over time  which would harm our operating results 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and customer service and support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments 
in developing new products  we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability 
as a result  we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 
a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical  food  food retailing and chemicals industries could adversely affect our operating results 
our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical  food and beverage and chemical industries 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior years 
a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control  including the resources available for purchasing equipment  the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures generally 
any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 
we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 
we plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company 
if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future  completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners  increases in our debt and contingent liabilities  and additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
any of these acquisition related risks could materially adversely affect our profitability 
larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering  which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets 
in addition  we may not be able to identify  successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future 
however  even if we can do so  we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 

table of contents if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights  or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others  our operating results could be harmed 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets 
our patents may not provide complete protection  and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents 
our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed 
although we take measures to protect confidential information  improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome  and management attention could be diverted 
if we are unsuccessful in such litigation  we may have to pay damages  stop the infringing activity and or obtain a license 
if we fail to obtain a required license  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could result in a decline in our revenues 
departures of key employees could impair our operations 
we have employment contracts with each of our key employees 
in addition  our key employees own shares of our common stock and or have options to purchase additional shares 
nevertheless  such individuals could leave the company 
if any key employees stopped working for us  our operations could be harmed 
we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 
we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations both in the us and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the us and abroad 
in addition  some of these facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future 
these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation 
accordingly  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies 
our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies 
these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products  from design and development  to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution 
in addition  we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 
we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 
starting in  our goodwill amortization charges have ceased 
as at december   our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is 
table of contents based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections 
in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic conditions  future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses 
the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth  controllable cost growth  perpetual growth  effective tax rates and discount rates 
our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 
our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biopharma capital spending 
we currently estimate the fair value of the company s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of million as of december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company monitors the fair value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are being achieved 
for example  we monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being realized 
the company s intangible assets include a million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license 
this license is currently subject to litigation with the grantor 
while the company believes its rights under the license will be upheld  if they were not to be upheld  expected cash flows generated by the license would be reduced and the related million asset could be impaired  causing a non cash charge of up to million after tax 
management does not believe this outcome or any other consequences of the case will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs not be accurate  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units  possibly prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 
our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 
overview we operate a global business  with sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name and reputation  our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions  and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 
net sales in us dollars increased by and in and  respectively  of which and was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have continued to face a challenging world economy in with conditions generally strong in asia and stabilizing to improving in the united states and europe 
looking forward to  we anticipate overall customer spending patterns to be similar to with certain differences based on geographic regions 
in asia we expect continued growth  but at a slower level than specifically  we believe growth in china will be less than the growth we experienced in in the us we expect to see similar customer spending levels to what we saw in and in europe we expect some improvement from the relatively weak levels of recent years 
in respect of our end user markets  we experienced improved results during in our laboratory related end user markets  such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers 
we believe that the long term fundamentals of this market are attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug approval activity  heightened price regulation and industry consolidation 
in our industrial markets  the principal growth driver in recent years has been increased investment in china related to production capacity 
although this provides a significant opportunity for our chinese operations  this manufacturing shift has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user markets in the us and europe 
food producers and packagers also remain a large part of our industrial customer base 
in recent years  we have benefited from these companies efforts to improve product quality and safety 
however  this sector is experiencing high levels of competitive pressure which may negatively impact customer spending levels 
in our retail end markets  we experienced improved results in both the us and europe relative to weak activity in recent years 
traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors 
increased spending in the past has come from events such as yk and the introduction of the euro currency 
we have not experienced similar triggering events in recent years 
similar to our industrial business  china is also an important driver of growth as the expansion of their local economy is creating a significant number of new retail stores each year 
in  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years gaining market share 
we launched a global sales and marketing initiative during we aim to accelerate our sales growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales and marketing processes 
while this initiative is broad based  initial efforts to improve these processes include the implementation of more effective pricing strategies and processes  increased activities for leads generation and further automation of field processes 
our comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets 
in addition to traditional services  we offer installation  calibration  regulatory compliance services and remote service support 
expanding emerging markets 
we have a two pronged strategy in asia first  to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second  to leverage our low cost manufacturing operations in china 
we have a long track record in china  and our sales in asia have grown at more than per year in local currency since we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china 
we are shifting more of our manufacturing to china to reduce costs  where our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 

table of contents extending our technology lead 
we continue to focus on product innovation 
in the last three years  we spent between and of net sales on research and development 
we seek to drive shorter product life cycles  as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software 
maintaining cost leadership 
we continue to strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost basis 
during the period following our buyout in  we reduced the number of our manufacturing facilities from to shifting production to china has been an important component of this consolidation 
we have also implemented global procurement programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs 
pursuing strategic acquisitions 
while we have not completed a significant acquisition since  acquisitions remain part of our growth strategy 
we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network  respected brand  extensive distribution channels and technological leadership 
we have identified life sciences  packaging and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 
non gaap financial measures we supplement our us gaap results with non gaap financial measures 
the principal non gaap financial measure we use is adjusted operating income  which we define as gross profit less research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges  before amortization  interest  other charges and taxes 
the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is net earnings 
we believe that adjusted operating income is important supplemental information for investors 
adjusted operating income is used internally as the principal profit measurement by our segments in their reporting to management 
we use this measure because it excludes amortization  interest  other charges and taxes  which are not allocated to the segments 
on a consolidated basis  we also believe adjusted operating income is an important supplemental method of measuring profitability 
it is used internally by senior management for measuring profitability  setting performance targets for managers and has historically been used as one of the means of publicly providing guidance on possible future results 
we also believe that adjusted operating income is an important performance measure because it provides a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital or legal structures  which accordingly may be subject to disparate interest rates and effective tax rates  and to companies which may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges related to intangible assets 
adjusted operating income is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance because of the following limitations 
limitations of our non gaap measure  adjusted operating income our non gaap measure  adjusted operating income  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance some of our operations  interest is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations  it does not include taxes 
because payment of taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes taxes has material limitations  and it excludes amortization expense and other charges 
because these items are recurring  any measure that excludes them has material limitations 
adjusted operating income should not be relied upon to the exclusion of us gaap financial measures  but reflects an additional measure of comparability and means of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed together with our us gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation to net earnings  provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 

table of contents because adjusted operating income is not standardized  it may not be possible to compare with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or a similar name 
we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
our adjusted operating income increased from million in to million in this performance was achieved while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure 
adjusted operating income includes restructuring charges of million in this charge is described more fully below 
a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net earnings for to is included in results of operations below 
restructuring activities as further described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  during the three months ended june  we recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax which comprised severance  asset write downs and other exit costs  primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
as a result of these actions  we eliminated approximately million of costs from the business 
we estimate that approximately million of these savings were realized in  million in  and million in in accordance with us gaap  the charge taken in the second quarter of related to the exit of our french manufacturing facility was limited to the minimum contractual payment required by french law 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax  related to the final union settlement on the closure of this facility 
this charge comprised the additional employee related costs resulting from final settlement of the social plan negotiated with the french workers council during the first quarter of we assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing basis 
during the three months ended september   we recorded a reduction in the restructuring accrual of million  included within other charges income  net  as a result of lower employee related charges than originally anticipated 
also  a restructuring charge of million was recorded during the three months ended september   related to an extension of manufacturing consolidation activities 
this charge comprised severance of million  included within other charges income  net  and inventory write downs of million  included within cost of sales 
at december   we had substantially completed the restructuring programs described above

our sales growth of laboratory related products was also reduced by approximately during due to the phase out of our exit of third party electronic component sales 
excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations  net sales for our laboratory related products decreased during  primarily due to a decrease in drug discovery products as a result of weakness in customer spending

retail sales growth also includes improved sales of our in store retail item management software solutions and expansion of our core retail products into asia 
net sales in food retailing decreased in excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
this decrease was principally due to difficult comparisons relating to strong us project activity in  as well as suppressed spending patterns in europe after the significant euro conversion related investments by customers in previous years and weak consumer confidence in major european economies

during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions  including additional consideration related to earn out periods associated with acquisitions consummated in prior years 
the cash portions of these purchases were funded from cash generated from operations 
we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  the terms of certain of our acquisitions provide for possible additional earn out payments 
however  we do not currently believe we will make any material payments relating to such earn outs 
capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows  and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change

interest is payable semi annually in may and november 
discount and issuance costs approximated million and are being amortized to interest expense over the seven year term of the senior notes 

table of contents at our option  the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the senior notes  or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis at a comparable treasury rate plus a margin of 
the senior notes contain limitations on our ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding of our consolidated net worth 
at december   our consolidated debt  net of cash of million  was million 
in addition to the senior notes  we had borrowings of million under our credit facility and million under various other local arrangements 
also at december   we had million of availability remaining under the credit facility 
at december   approximately million of the borrowings under the credit facility and local working capital facilities were denominated in us dollars 
the balance of the borrowings under the credit facility and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately million 
changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our credit facility and senior notes agreements 
in addition  we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with liquidity available under our credit facility and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next several years 
contractual obligations the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt a non cancelable operating leases b purchase obligations c total d a as described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
c represents agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company 
d excludes normal employer pension contributions which are expected to be million in we have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services and fixed assets in the normal course of business 
due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions 
we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition 
this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 

table of contents share repurchase program on february   we announced a share repurchase program  commencing with an initial buyback of up to million over the two year period ending december  in november  in addition to the million buyback amount the company s board of directors approved an additional buyback of up to million under its share repurchase program over the two year period ending december  our share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities 
repurchases will be made through open market transactions  and the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity  business and market conditions  the stock price  trading restrictions and other factors 
during the year ending december   we spent million on the repurchase of  shares at an average price of 
as of december   approximately million stock options were outstanding that are scheduled to expire in october these options were granted before the company s initial public offering in connection with the buy out from ciba geigy 
the company expects that these options will be exercised before their expiration date 
any purchases under the share repurchase program over this time would operate to offset the dilution from these exercises 
investigation at the april audit committee meeting  management informed the committee that the company had received allegations from an employee 
as a matter of good corporate governance  management recommended  and the audit committee agreed  to conduct an independent investigation of the allegations 
the allegations covered a number of accounting  disclosure and non financial statement related items 
the audit committee retained independent outside counsel and forensic accountants to conduct an investigation of these matters  as well as certain other areas directly or indirectly related to the company s preparation of its financial statements 
in august  the company announced the completion of the financial aspects of the investigation and that the audit committee and board of directors concluded there would be no change to the company s financial statements 
based on the investigation  the board based on the recommendation of the audit committee made changes to improve the leadership and oversight of its financial operations and to reinforce the board s commitment to maintaining strong corporate governance 
mr 
william donnelly  who was chief financial officer from to mid returned from an operating job inside the company to the position of cfo in august the company has also stated that it plans additional changes to enhance its financial organization  as well as the methods by which complaints may be reported 
all aspects of the audit committee s investigation are now complete 
off balance sheet arrangements currently  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 
effect of currency on results of operations because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in 
table of contents those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
accordingly  the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross rate monitored by the company 
we estimate that a strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
based on our outstanding debt at december   we estimate that a weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions  earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a non consolidated non combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated non combined affiliated legal entities 
as a result  we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were approximately  and  respectively  as described in results of operations consolidated interest expense and taxes 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities in both the united states and abroad 
our subsidiary hi speed checkweigher co  inc hi speed is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain remedial actions under an administrative consent order that the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep signed on june  with respect to certain property in landing  new jersey 
gei international corporation gei is the other ordered party 
gei has failed to fulfill all its obligations under the njdep order  and hi speed has recently entered into discussions with the njdep about the next steps to be undertaken as a result 
njdep has agreed with hi speed that the residual contaminants can be addressed through the establishment of a classification exception area and concurrent well restriction area for the site 
the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures  but rather as institutional controls that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated 
the company estimates that the costs of compliance associated with the site will be approximately million over the next seven years 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
accordingly  although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use  including raw materials to manufacture our products 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we 
table of contents incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  as our presence in china and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge short term intercompany balances with our international businesses and a portion of our swiss franc euro exposure on a monthly basis 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar and swiss franc on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by against all of our currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million at december   as compared with million at december  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the market value of these contracts at both december  and was million 
based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million  as compared with a decrease of million at december  conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments  as compared with a net increase of million at december  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to pensions and other post retirement benefits  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue and warranty costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
employee benefit plans the net periodic pension cost for and projected benefit obligation as of december  were million and million  respectively  for our us pension plans  and million and million  respectively  for our international pension plans 
the net periodic post retirement cost for and projected benefit obligation as of december  for our us post retirement medical benefit plan were million and million  respectively 

table of contents pension and post retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations 
these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets  which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities 
in april  we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees 
consequently  no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans 
for  the average return on assets assumption was for the us plan and for the international plans 
a change in the rate of return of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
the discount rates for defined benefit and post retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high quality corporate bonds 
for  the average discount rate assumption was for the us plans and for the international plans  representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist 
a decrease in the discount rate of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
in and  we made voluntary incremental funding payments of million and million  respectively  to reduce the underfunded status of our us and us pension plans 
as a result of these voluntary incremental pension payments  we do not expect to make any significant required pension payments during the next two years 
however  if the equity markets do not mirror expected rates of return  in the future we could be required to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the million additional minimum pension liability recorded at december  the company also has employee stock option plans which are accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
as stock options have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date  no compensation cost has resulted 
notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements provide supplemental information  including pro forma earnings and earnings per share  as if the company had accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
that methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates  including future volatility and estimated option lives 
changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 
see also statement no 
revised issued by the fasb in regards to stock based compensation in note  summary of significant accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements 
inventory as of december   inventories net of allowances were million 
we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost  which includes direct materials  labor and overhead  is generally determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
excess and obsolete reserves are established based on forecast usage  orders and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections 
in preparing the valuation models  we consider a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic conditions  future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses 
the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth  controllable cost growth  perpetual growth  effective tax rates and discount rates 
our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 
our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in biotech and pharmaceutical capital spending 
we currently estimate the fair value of the company s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of million as of december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company monitors the fair value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are being achieved 
for example  we monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being realized 
the company s intangible assets include a million indefinite life intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license 
this license is currently subject to litigation with the grantor 
while the company believes its rights under the license will be upheld  if they were not to be upheld  expected cash flows generated by the license would be reduced and the related million asset could be impaired  causing a non cash charge of up to million after tax 
management does not believe this outcome or any other consequences of the case will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding paragraphs not be accurate  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units  possibly prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 
our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 
income taxes income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income  equity or goodwill in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in and  provisions were made for us income taxes on certain undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries as a decision was made to repatriate these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them 
if we decide to repatriate an amount of undistributed earnings in excess of those originally planned  we could be subject to additional income tax 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  or should our income mix from our geographical regions change  our effective tax rate can be materially affected 
based on pre tax income of million for the year ended december   each increase of million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled 
standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and  accordingly  title transfers upon shipment 
in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery  we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred 
other than a few small software applications  mettler toledo does not sell its software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument 
the company s typical solution requires no significant production  modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 
we also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and conditions 
to the extent the company s solutions have a post shipment obligation  such as customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed 
in addition  we also defer revenue where installation is required  unless such installation is perfunctory 
distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 
we also maintain accruals for outstanding credits 
revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period 
warranty the company generally offers one year warranties on most of its products 
product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material  freight and vendor charges  our cost of goods sold could be affected
