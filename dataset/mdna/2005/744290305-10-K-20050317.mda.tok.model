introduction we believe we are the nation s second largest independent provider based electronic healthcare transaction services company 
we provide connectivity and cost containment services and related value added products to physicians  payers  pharmacies  medical laboratories  and other healthcare providers and suppliers 
our services support a broad range of financial  clinical and administrative transactions  and are hipaa certified through edifecs 
to facilitate these services  we are completing the conversion of all our non clinical edi clients to phoenix  our secure proprietary national electronic information network  which provides physicians and other healthcare providers with direct connectivity to one of the industry s largest lists of payers 
our corporate headquarters is located in atlanta  georgia and our products and services are provided from various operational facilities located throughout the united states 
we also operate our clinical computer network and portions of our financial and real time production computer networks from a secure  third party co location site also located in atlanta  georgia 
our primary strategy is focused on leveraging our leading position as an independent back end connectivity provider to physician offices 
through strategic relationships and partnerships with front end solution providers  our goal is to drive more healthcare transactions through phoenix while remaining neutral in the battle for the physician s desktop 
additionally  we expect that there will be opportunities to increase revenues by cross selling our existing products and services to our current customer base of physicians and other healthcare providers  as well as revenue opportunities from the development of new services from our development efforts  including internet based transaction services 
we remain committed to developing additional capabilities and value added products and services  and to expanding our back end connectivity network 
in conjunction with this philosophy  we have recently introduced pcat and proxyenroll  our new web based service tools for support and enrollment 
we have also added new services offerings for our payer customers through our acquisition of planvista corporation planvista for claims repricing services 
acquisitions on december   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of medunite  inc medunite for million in cash and the issuance of an aggregate of million principal amount of convertible promissory notes 
in addition  we paid approximately million in transaction and exit related costs which were originally estimated at million 
interest on the convertible promissory notes is payable in cash on a quarterly basis 
the convertible promissory notes now currently payable at a maturity value of million after a claim setoff against the escrow in december are payable in full on december   and are convertible into an aggregate of  shares originally  shares before the claim setoff of our common stock if our revenues resulting from business with the former medunite owners exceed certain thresholds over a three and one half year period from the date of acquisition 
on march   we acquired planvista  a company that provides medical cost containment and business process outsourcing solutions for the medical insurance and managed care industries  as well as services for healthcare providers  including individual providers  preferred provider organizations and other provider groups for  shares of our common stock issued to planvista shareholders valued at million based on the average closing price of our common stock for the day of and the two days before and after december   the date of the announcement of the definitive agreement 
we also assumed debt and other liabilities of planvista  totaling million and paid million in acquisition related costs 
additionally  we raised million in a private placement sale of  shares of our common stock to general atlantic partners  commonwealth associates and other parties to partially fund repayment of certain of planvista s debts and other obligations outstanding at the time of the acquisition 
the merger enables us to offer a new suite of products and services  provide new end to end services  increase sales opportunities with payers  strengthen business ties with certain customers  expand technological capabilities  reduce operating costs and enhance our public profile 
upon completion of the acquisition  each share of planvista s outstanding common stock was cancelled and converted into shares of our common stock and each holder of planvista series c preferred stock received shares of our common stock in exchange for each share of planvista series c preferred stock  representing approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis  and the holders of our outstanding stock  options and warrants retained approximately of proxymed following the transaction 
planvista s operations are included in our transaction services segment commencing march sale of assets on june   we sold certain assets and liabilities of our laboratory communication solutions segment that were used in our non core contract manufacturing business to a new entity owned by a former executive of proxymed for million in cash 
under terms of the sale agreement  we received million in cash at closing and received the balance of million in cash in july and august following the presentation of the final accounting 
as part of the disposition  we agreed to purchase certain component parts from the new owner for use in our laboratory communication solutions business on a non exclusive basis at a fixed price deemed to be at fair market value by management 
these parts were valued at million at june  as of december   this remaining commitment had been reduced to less than million 
additionally  we agreed to sublease a portion of our current facilities through july and provide certain administrative services to the new entity 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded a loss on sale of assets of million in the year ended december  this loss includes the value of options to purchase  shares of the our common stock granted to the former executive at an exercise price of in july operating segments we currently operate in two reportable segments that are separately managed transaction services formerly known as electronic healthcare transaction processing and laboratory communication solutions 
transaction services includes transaction  cost containment and other value added services principally between physicians and insurance companies and physicians and pharmacies  and laboratory communication solutions includes the sale  lease and service of communication devices principally to laboratories and  through june   the contract manufacturing of printed circuit boards 
commencing in march  the operations of plan vista are included in our transaction services segment 
as a result of a re alignment of our corporate overhead functions in the second quarter of  we now report these expenses as part of our transaction services segment 
accordingly  our corporate expenses in the comparable periods have been combined with our transaction services segment to facilitate a better comparison between periods in this section 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
consolidated net revenues for increased by million  or  to million from consolidated net revenues of million for net revenues classified by our reportable segments are as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions net revenues in our transaction services segment for increased by million  or  over this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of planvista increase of million  offset by declines in volumes of electronic claims  statements and other real time transactions processed decrease million and additional revenue reserves required due to a degradation in the aging of outstanding traditional accounts increase of million 
while core transaction growth was down compared to the prior year see below  revenue dollars have grown significantly due to the higher per transaction revenue attributable to our cost containment transactions compared to our traditional core transactions 
for  approximately of our revenues came from our transaction services segment compared to from this segment for laboratory communication solutions segment net revenues for decreased by million  or  from primarily as a result of the asset sale discussed earlier in this report decrease of million 
a summary of the number of transactions we processed for the periods presented is as follows in thousands core transactions additional core transactions encounters total transactions includes million cost containment transactions in the period from proxymed s acquisition of planvista core transactions represent all transactions except for encounters 
additionally  as a result of a continued review of our business  we have made changes to our transaction counts to insure that our transactions are counted on the same methodology for all purposes  whether internal or external 
previously  we had excluded certain transactions primarily associated with an outsourcing contract due to the nature of the business model for those transactions 
these transactions are included above as additional core transactions in and cost containment transactions represent the number of claims sent by our payer clients to be re priced through our provider network 
encounters are an administrative reporting transaction for payers but do not generate revenue for the provider who must submit them 
accordingly  rather than submitting on a routine basis  most providers choose to periodically catch up on their submissions  creating monthly and quarterly swings in both the number of encounters we process and what percentage of our transaction mix they represent 
since encounters are at a significantly lower price point than claims  these swings make it difficult to analyze our quarter over quarter growth in our business 
in addition  we do not expect our encounter volume to grow on an annual basis  as payers are not expanding the capitated service model that is the foundation of encounters 
therefore  we believe that breaking out encounters shows more clearly our growth in core transactions 
cost of sales 
consolidated cost of sales decreased as a percentage of net revenues to for from for cost of sales classified by our reportable segments is as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions cost of sales in our transaction services segment consists of transaction fees  provider network outsourcing fees  services and license fees  third party electronic transaction processing costs  certain telecommunication and co location center costs  revenue sharing arrangements with our business partners  third party database licenses  and certain travel expenses

upon expiration of the warrant in december  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of million representing the original value of the warrant for the year 
interest expense  net 
consolidated net interest expense for the was million compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase in expense is primarily due to the assumption of debt in conjunction with the planvista acquisition increase of million

segment sg a expenses as a percentage of segment net revenues increased to for compared to in due to the higher expense run rate in the medunite operations earlier in the period compared to our existing business 
while we incurred significant sg a costs related to the medunite operations in the first quarter of  we were successful at significantly reducing the monthly operating expenses in the second and third quarters of and thus achieving much improved results in the second half of the year 
we were successful in eliminating or renegotiating substantial telecommunication expenses and duplicative contact management  human resources and customer relationship management systems 
however  this improvement was somewhat offset as the development projects related to the integration of medunite were moved into production resulting in a decrease in the amount of capitalized development related to our real time and phoenix platforms 
by the end of the period based on our unaudited fourth quarter results  sg a expenses in this segment were of segment revenues and indicative of the run rate we expected for a combined operation 
sg a expenses in our laboratory communication solutions segment decreased by in the period from the same period last year primarily due to cost cutting measures implemented in the third quarter of segment sg a expenses as a percentage of segment net revenues remained the same at for both periods 
corporate sg a expenses increased for the period compared to the same period of last year due to increased insurance premiums  professional fees and personnel costs 
we expect our corporate sg a expenses to increase in as a result of our compliance efforts related to the sarbanes oxley act of and financial systems consolidation plans for depreciation and amortization 
consolidated depreciation and amortization increased by million to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to million for the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the medunite acquisition  which includes amortization of proxymed 
net  our real time network based on the technology platform acquired from medunite  and the amortization of the customer relationships acquired from medunite

upon expiration of the warrant in december  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of million representing the original value of the warrant for the year 
interest income expense  net 
consolidated net interest expense was million compared to net interest income of million for this increase in expense is primarily due to interest related to proxymed s convertible debt issued to the former owners of medunite and the financing of certain liabilities of medunite during the period  and lower interest income earned on a smaller investment base at lower interest rates

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million as of december  compared to million at december  these available funds will be used for operations  strategic acquisitions  the further development of our products and services  repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes 
we continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities and strategic alternatives that may add synergies to our product offerings and business strategy 
on march   we acquired planvista through the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at million 
in addition  we raised an additional million in a private placement sale of our common stock and drew down million on our asset based line of credit 
these funds  along with available cash resources  were used to satisfy million of planvista s debt and other obligations outstanding as of the effective time of the acquisition 
we do not have any material commitments for any other capital expenditures  however  we have budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures and capitalized development for in  we spent million towards hardware and software costs primarily related to our technical infrastructure and administrative systems 
we have also spent million towards capitalized development of our internal systems 
furthermore  in  we have incurred costs of approximately million in connection with the implementation of our internal control procedures mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of and with our financial system consolidation efforts 
we have also spent the better part of two years on hipaa compliance efforts  which has resulted in significant costs 
we now have over of our total transaction volume migrated to a hipaa compliant connection to our payer customers 
however  on our submitter customer side  of our providers continue to submit their transactions to us in legacy formats and rely on us to help meet hipaa format requirements 
our continued efforts on the submitter side for hipaa compliance will force us to continue to spend additional funds in the future 
at the time of our acquisition of planvista  there existed several pending and threatened preacquisition contingencies 
we settled and or had dismissed the majority of these cases before december  resulting in payments of approximately million in and a net payment of million in january as of the filing of this report  two significant preacquisition contingencies remain unresolved 
one of these cases is a class action suit for which we cannot estimate any range of settlement at this time 
the other case is still in mediation and we have estimated a minimum settlement of million for which we have accrued this amount at december  in december  we closed on a million asset based line of credit with our commercial bank 
borrowing under such facility is subject to eligible cash  accounts receivable  and inventory and other conditions 
borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus or at libor plus or libor plus in the case of borrowings against eligible cash only 
as a result of our acquisition of planvista  we drew down million against this line at the end of february which was repaid in early march 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million 
during this period  we paid million for our acquisition of medunite and paid million for two other acquisitions  paid million for purchase of certain customer relationships  paid in full our million promissory note related to a acquisition  and paid million for fixed assets and capitalized software 
these activities were principally financed through a private placement of our common stock valued at million in april  proceeds of million from the exercise of b warrants  and available cash resources 
outstanding as of march  that we repaid in april with extensions granted by the commercial bank  this line of credit will expire on april  as of march   we have executed a term sheet with the bank to expand and extend its current line of credit 
the bank will receive first lien security on all proxymed assets including all subsidiaries 
we expect to repay the note the company assumed as part of the planvista acquisition through the proceeds of this expanded line of credit and its current cash balances prior to the due date of the assumed note 
as noted above  with our acquisition of planvista  we utilized the million in proceeds raised from our private placement  drew million on our line of credit and used available cash to satisfy million of planvista s debt and other obligations and expenses outstanding as of the effective time of the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  we acquired a cash flow positive company with million in senior debt due in may originally at an interest rate of until december when the interest rate increased to 
the company is currently negotiating financing with a bank to provide funds to be used with existing cash balances to make the may  million payment related to the debt assumed in the planvista acquisition 
if the company is unable to arrange this financing and is unable to make this balloon payment  the company may be unable to continue as a going concern 
the following table represents our contractual cash obligations due over the next several years 
operating leases are shown net of any sublease agreements 
in thousands interest on convertible notes interest on senior and other debt convertible notes senior debt notes payable litigation settlement capital lease obligations operating leases total assumes no conversion of convertible notes includes principal and interest net of insurance reimbursement we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to fund our future operational requirements and capital expenditures  and a sufficient level of capital in order to fund specific research and development projects or to pursue smaller additional strategic acquisitions 
we expect to refinance the planvista debt  by obtaining a new senior line of credit in order to satisfy this debt on or before maturity 
if we require additional funding in the future to satisfy any of our outstanding future obligations  or further our strategic plans  there can be no assurance that any additional funding will be available to us  or if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of significantly diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we believe that if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing for further product development or strategic acquisitions  such inability may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our business plan and may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  but we believe that any variation in results would not have a material effect on our financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition revenue is derived from our transaction services and laboratory communication solutions segments 
in our transaction services segment  we provide transaction and value added services principally between healthcare providers and insurance companies  and physicians and pharmacies 
such transactions and services include edi claims submission and reporting  insurance eligibility verification  claims status inquiries  referral management  electronic remittance advice  patient statement processing  encounters  and cost containment transaction services including claims repricing and bill renegotiation 
in our laboratory communication solutions segment  we sell  rent and service intelligent remote reporting devices and provide lab results reporting through our software products 
transaction services revenues are derived from insurance payers  pharmacies and submitters physicians and other entities including billing services  practice management software vendors  and claims aggregators 
such revenues are recorded on either a per transaction fee basis or on a flat fee basis per physician  per tax id  etc 
and are recognized in the period the service is rendered 
agreements with payers or pharmacies are for one to three years on a non exclusive basis 
agreements with submitters are for one year  renew automatically  and are generally terminable thereafter upon to days notice 
transaction fees vary according to the type of transaction and other factors  including volume level commitments 
revenue from medical cost containment business in our transaction services segment is recognized when the services are performed and are recorded net of their estimated allowance 
these revenues are primarily in the form of fees generated from the discounts we secure for the payers that access our provider network 
we enter into agreements with healthcare payer customers that require them to pay a percentage of the cost savings generated from our network discounts with participating providers 
these agreements are generally terminable upon days notice 
revenue from a percentage of savings contract is generally recognized when the related claims processing and administrative services have been performed 
the remainder of the revenue from our medical cost containment business is generated from customers that pay a monthly fee based on eligible employees enrolled in a benefit plan covered by our health benefits payers clients 
also in our transaction services segment  certain transaction fee revenue is subject to revenue sharing pursuant to agreements with resellers  vendors or gateway partners and is recorded as gross revenues in accordance with eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
such revenue sharing amounts are based on a per transaction amount or a percentage of revenue basis and may involve increasing amounts or percentages based on transaction or revenue volumes achieved 
revenue from certain up front fees charged primarily for the development of edi for payers and the implementation of services for submitters in our transaction services segment is amortized ratably over three years  which is the expected life of the customer in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

revenue from support and maintenance contracts on our products in both our transaction services and laboratory communication solutions segments is recognized ratably over the contract period  which does not exceed one year 
such amounts are billed in advance and established as deferred revenue 
in our laboratory communication solutions segment  revenue from sales of inventory and manufactured goods is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable in accordance with sab no 
revenues from maintenance fees on laboratory communication devices are charged on an annual or quarterly basis and are recognized ratably over the service period 
service fees may also be charged on a per event basis and are recognized after the service has been performed 
revenue from the rental of laboratory communication devices is recognized ratably over the applicable period of the rental contract 
such contracts require monthly rental payments and are for a one to three year term  then renewing to a month to month period after the initial term is expired 
contracts may be cancelled upon days notice 
a significant amount of rental revenues are derived from contracts that are no longer under the initial non cancelable term 
at the end of the rental period  the customer may return or purchase the unit for fair market value 
upon sale of the revenue earning equipment  the gross proceeds are included in net revenues and the undepreciated cost of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales 
goodwill we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a fair value methodology versus an undiscounted cash flow method required under previous accounting rules 
in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
 we completed our most recent annual test at december  utilizing cash flow based market comparables in assessing fair value for our goodwill impairment testing and we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
to the extent that future cash flows differ from those projected in our analysis  fair value of our goodwill may be affected and may result in an impairment change 
capitalized software development and research and development costs incurred internally and fees paid to outside contractors and consultants during the application development stage of our internally used software products are capitalized 
costs of upgrades and major enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized 
costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades are expensed as incurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred as research and development expenses and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
application development stage costs generally include software configuration  coding  installation to hardware and testing 
once the project is completed  capitalized costs are amortized over their remaining estimated economic life 
our judgment is used in determining whether costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we periodically review projected cash flows and other criteria in assessing the impairment of any internal use capitalized software and take impairment charges as needed 
purchased technology and other intangibles assets purchased technology and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
the carrying values of purchased technology and intangible assets are reviewed if the facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
this review indicates whether assets will be recoverable based on future expected cash flows  and  if not recoverable  whether there is an impairment of such assets 
reserve for doubtful accounts revenue allowances bad debt estimates we rely on estimates to determine revenue allowances  the bad debt expense and the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
additionally  in our medical cost containment business  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize revenue reserves based on past write off history  average percentage of receivables written off historically  and the length of time the receivables are past due 
to the extent historical credit experience is not indicative of future performance or other assumptions used by management do not prevail  loss experience could differ significantly  resulting in either higher or lower future provision for losses

 shares convertible from our million convertible notes may be required to be included in the calculation of our earnings per share in periods of net income  however  the fasb has yet to reach a conclusion as to the effect of non market price triggers on earnings per share calculations in situations where the instrument contains only non market price trigger  such as our convertible notes  and therefore the impact on the consolidated financial statements is not determinable at this time

sfas no 
r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments and will be recognized and expensed over the period which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
fair value is based on market prices if those prices are publicly available 
if not available  sfas r does not specifically require the use of a particular model  however  the most common models are the black scholes model and lattice binomial models 
additionally  modifications to an equity award after the grant date will require a compensation cost to be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the award immediately before the modification
