during  the bank opened one branch in chandler  in henderson county  and one branch in jacksonville  in cherokee county 
the company opened a loan processing office in gresham  in smith county  during january the company intends to expand into seven points  a city located approximately miles northwest of tyler in henderson county  during the company expects its presence in the gregg  cherokee and henderson county market areas to continue to increase in the future  however  the city of tyler in smith county presently represents the company s largest market area 
the principal economic activities in the company s market area include retail  distribution  manufacturing  medical services  education and oil and gas industries

these economic activities support a growing regional system of medical service  retail and education centers

the company serves its markets through twenty two branch locations  thirteen of which are located in grocery stores 
the branches are located in and around tyler  longview  lindale  jacksonville  bullard  chandler and whitehouse 
the company s television and radio advertising has extended into these market areas for several years  providing the bank name recognition throughout smith  gregg  cherokee and henderson counties

these products allow the company s customers to apply for loans from their computers  access account information and conduct various other transactions from their telephones and computers 
lending activities one of the company s main objectives is to seek attractive lending opportunities in east texas  primarily in the counties in which it operates 
substantially all of the company s loans are made to borrowers who live in and conduct business in east texas  with the exception of municipal loans 
total loans as of december  increased million or while the average balance was up million or when compared to real estate loans increased million or from december  to december  municipal loans as of december  increased million or from december  and commercial loans increased million or from december  loans to individuals decreased million or from december  the increase in real estate loans was due to the economic growth in the company s market area  the continued strong commitment to real estate lending and less refinancing of real estate loans on the company s books during when compared to the growth of loans made to municipalities in texas was a result of the company s continued strong commitment in this lending area combined with the company s ability to close these transactions in a timely manner 
the increase in commercial loans is reflective of the growth in the company s market area 
the decrease in loans to individuals reflects the difficulty the company has competing against extremely low interest rates offered by automobile manufacturers combined with the fact that home equity loans have replaced some of the traditional loans to individuals 
in the loan portfolio  loans dependent upon private household income represent a significant concentration 
due to the number of customers involved who work in all sectors of the local economy  the company believes the risk in this portion of the portfolio is adequately spread throughout the economic community  which assists in mitigating this concentration 

table of contents the aggregate amount of loans that the bank is permitted to make under applicable bank regulations to any one borrower  including related entities  is of unimpaired certified capital and surplus 
the bank s legal lending limit at december  was million 
the bank s largest loan relationship at december  was approximately million 
the average yield on loans for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  this decrease was reflective of the repricing characteristics of the loans  interest rates at the time loans repriced  and the competitive loan pricing environment 
loan portfolio composition and associated risk the following table sets forth loan totals net of unearned discount by category for the years presented december  in thousands real estate loans construction family residential other commercial loans municipal loans loans to individuals total loans for purposes of this discussion  the company s loans are divided into four categories real estate loans  commercial loans  municipal loans and loans to individuals 

table of contents real estate loans real estate loans represent the company s greatest concentration of loans 
however  the amount of risk associated with this group of loans is mitigated in part due to the type of loans involved 
at december   the majority of the company s real estate loans were collateralized by properties located in smith and gregg counties 
of the million in real estate loans  million or represent loans collateralized by residential dwellings that are primarily owner occupied 
historically  the amount of losses suffered on this type of loan has been significantly less than those on other properties 
the company s loan policy requires an appraisal or evaluation on the property  based on the size and complexity of the transaction  prior to funding any real estate loan and also outlines the requirements for appraisals on renewals 
management pursues an aggressive policy of reappraisal on any real estate loan that is in the process of foreclosure and potential exposures are recognized and reserved for or charged off as soon as they are identified 
the slow pace of absorption for certain types of properties could adversely affect the volume of nonperforming real estate loans held by the company 
real estate loans are divided into three categories family residential mortgage loans  construction loans and other 
the other category consists of million of commercial real estate loans  million of loans secured by multifamily properties and million of loans secured by farm land 
the commercial real estate portion of other will be discussed in more detail below 
family residential mortgage loans residential loan originations are generated by the company s loan officers  in house origination staff  marketing efforts  present customers  walk in customers and referrals from real estate agents  and builders 
the company focuses its lending efforts primarily on the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied  family residences 
substantially all of the company s family residential mortgage originations are secured by properties located in the company s market area 
historically  the company has originated a portion of its residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market 
these loans are reflected on the balance sheet as loans held for sale 
these secondary market investors typically pay the company a service release premium in addition to a predetermined price based on the interest rate of the loan originated 
the company warehouses these loans until they are transferred to the secondary market investor  which usually occurs within days 
the company s family residential mortgage loans generally have maturities ranging from five to years 
these loans are typically fully amortizing with monthly payments sufficient to repay the total amount of the loan or amortizing with a balloon feature  typically due in fifteen years or less 
the company s family residential mortgage loans are made at both fixed and adjustable interest rates 
the company reviews information concerning the income  financial condition  employment and credit history when evaluating the creditworthiness of the applicant 
included as part of the family residential mortgage loans  the company also makes home equity loans and at december   these loans totaled million 
construction loans the company s construction loans are collateralized by property located primarily in the company s market area 
a majority of the company s construction loans are directed toward properties that will be owner occupied 
construction loans for projects built on speculation are financed  but these typically have secondary sources of repayment 
the company s construction loans have both adjustable and fixed interest rates during the construction period 
construction loans to individuals are typically priced and made with the intention of granting the permanent loan on the property 

table of contents commercial real estate loans in determining whether to originate commercial real estate loans  the company generally considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower and the debt service coverage of the property 
commercial real estate loans are made at both fixed and adjustable interest rates for terms generally up to years 
commercial real estate loans primarily include commercial office buildings  retail  medical facilities and offices  warehouse facilities  hotels and churches 
commercial loans the company s commercial loans are diversified to meet most business needs 
loan types include short term working capital loans for inventory and accounts receivable and short and medium term loans for equipment or other business capital expansion 
management does not consider there to be any material concentration of risk in any one industry type  other than medical  in this loan category 
medical loan types include all loan types listed above for commercial loans 
collateral for these loans varies depending on the type of loan and financial strength of the borrower 
the primary source of repayment for loans in the medical community is cashflow from continuing operations 
the medical community represents a concentration of risk in the company s commercial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolio see market area 
we believe that risk in the medical community is mitigated because it is spread among multiple practice types and multiple specialties 
should the government change the amount it pays the medical community through the various government health insurance programs  the medical community could be adversely impacted which in turn could result in higher default rates by borrowers in the medical industry 
in its commercial business loan underwriting  the company assesses the creditworthiness  ability to repay  and the value and liquidity of the collateral being offered 
terms are generally granted commensurate with the useful life of the collateral offered 
municipal loans the company has a specific lending department that makes loans to municipalities and school districts throughout the state of texas 
the majority of the loans to municipalities and school districts have tax or revenue pledges and in some cases  are additionally supported by collateral 
municipal loans made without a direct pledge of taxes are usually made based on some type of collateral that represents an essential service 
lending money directly to these municipalities allows the company to earn a higher yield than it could if it purchased municipal securities 
total loans to municipalities and school districts as of december  increased million when compared to at december   the company had total loans to municipalities and school districts of million 
loans to individuals one of the company s goals is to be a major consumer lender in its market area 
the majority of consumer loans outstanding are collateralized by titled equipment  primarily vehicles  which accounted for approximately million or of total loans to individuals at december  the company s loans collateralized by titled equipment declined during due to extremely low interest rates offered by the automobile manufacturers 
should this type of low financing continue the company may see additional decreases in this portfolio 
home equity loans have also replaced some of the traditional loans to individuals 
in addition  the company makes loans for a full range of other consumer purposes  which may be secured or unsecured depending on the credit quality and purpose of the loan 
management believes that the economy in the company s market area appears to reflect stable growth 
one area of concern is the personal bankruptcy rate in the company s market area 
management expects the personal bankruptcy rate could have some adverse effect on the company s net charge offs 
most of the company s loans to individuals are collateralized  which management believes should limit the company s exposure should current bankruptcy levels continue 
consumer loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral  length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower 
the underwriting standards employed by the company for consumer loans include an application  a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts  with the greatest weight being given to payment history with the company  and an assessment of the borrower s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although creditworthiness of the 
table of contents applicant is a primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral  if any  in relation to the proposed loan amount 
loan maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates the following table represents loan maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the amounts of total loans outstanding at december   which  based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal  are due in one year or less  more than one year but less than five years  and more than five years  are shown in the following table 
the amounts due after one year are classified according to the sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
after one due in one but within after five year or less five years years in thousands real estate loans construction real estate loans family residential real estate loans other commercial loans municipal loans loans to individuals total loans loans with maturities after one year for which interest rates are fixed or predetermined  interest rates are floating or adjustable  the volume of commercial loans due within one year reflects the company s general policy of attempting to limit a majority of these loans to a short term maturity 
loans are shown net of unearned discount 
nonaccrual loans totaling  are reflected in the due after five years column 
loans to affiliated parties in the normal course of business  the company makes loans to certain of its own executive officers and directors and their related interests 
as of december  and  these loans totaled million in both years or and of shareholders equity  respectively 
such loans are made in the normal course of business at normal credit terms  including interest rate and collateral requirements and do not represent more than normal credit risks contained in the rest of the loan portfolio for loans of similar types 
loan loss experience and allowance for loan losses the loan loss allowance is based on the most current review of the loan portfolio at that time 
several methods are used to maintain the review in the most current manner 
first  the servicing officer has the primary responsibility for updating significant changes in a customer s financial position 
accordingly  each officer prepares status updates on any credit deemed to be experiencing repayment difficulties which  in the officer s opinion  would place the collection of principal or interest in doubt 
second  the internal loan review department for the company is responsible for an ongoing review of the company s loan portfolio with specific goals set for loans to be reviewed on an annual basis 
at each review of a credit  a subjective analysis methodology is used to grade the respective loan 
categories of grading vary in severity to include loans which do not appear to have a significant probability of loss at the time of review to grades which indicate a probability that the entire balance of the loan will be uncollectible 
if full collection of the loan balance appears unlikely at the time of review  estimates or appraisals of the collateral securing the debt are used to allocate the necessary allowances 
a list of loans or loan relationships of  or more  which are graded as having more than the normal degree of risk 
table of contents associated with them  is maintained by the internal loan review officer 
this list is updated on a periodic basis  but no less than quarterly in order to properly allocate necessary allowances and keep management informed on the status of attempts to correct the deficiencies noted in the credit 
industry experience shows that a portion of the company s loans will become delinquent and a portion of the loans will require partial or entire charge off 
regardless of the underwriting criteria utilized  losses may be experienced as a result of various factors beyond the company s control  including  among other things  changes in market conditions affecting the value of properties and problems affecting the credit of the borrower 
management s determination of the adequacy of allowance for loan losses is based on various considerations  including an analysis of the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans  previous loan loss experience  specific loans which would have loan loss potential  delinquency trends  estimated fair value of the underlying collateral  current economic conditions  the views of the regulators who have the authority to require additional allowances  and geographic and industry loan concentration 
as of december   the company s review of the loan portfolio indicated that a loan loss allowance of million was adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 

table of contents the following table presents information regarding the average amount of net loans outstanding  changes in the allowance for loan losses  the ratio of net loans charged off to average net loans outstanding and an allocation of the allowance for loan losses

table of contents nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of delinquent loans days or more past due  nonaccrual loans  other real estate owned  repossessed assets and restructured loans 
nonaccrual loans are those loans which are days or more delinquent and collection in full of both the principal and interest is in doubt 
additionally  some loans that are not delinquent may be placed on nonaccrual status due to doubts about full collection of principal or interest 
when a loan is categorized as nonaccrual  the accrual of interest is discontinued and the accrued balance is reversed for financial statement purposes 
restructured loans represent loans which have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrowers 
categorization of a loan as nonperforming is not in itself a reliable indicator of probable loan loss 
other factors  such as the value of collateral securing the loan and the financial condition of the borrower must be considered in judgments as to potential loan loss 
other real estate owned oreo represents real estate taken in full or partial satisfaction of debts previously contracted 
the dollar amount of oreo is based on a current evaluation of the oreo at the time it is recorded on the company s books  net of estimated selling costs 
updated valuations are obtained as needed and any additional impairments are recognized 
total nonperforming assets at december  were million  up million or from million at december  other real estate owned increased  or to  from december  to december  of the other real estate owned  are residential dwellings and are commercial properties 
the company is actively marketing all properties and none are being held for investment purposes 
from december  to december   nonaccrual loans increased  or to million 
of this total  are residential real estate loans  are commercial real estate loans  are commercial loans and are loans to individuals 
approximately million of the nonaccrual loans at december   are loans that have an average sba guarantee of approximately

table of contents nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased from the previous year and as a percentage of loans increased 
nonperforming assets represent a drain on the earning ability of the company 
decreases in earnings are due both to the loss of interest income and the costs associated with maintaining the oreo  for taxes  insurance and other operating expenses 
in addition to the nonperforming assets  at december  in the opinion of management  the company had  of loans identified as potential problem loans 
a potential problem loan is a loan where information about possible credit problems of the borrower is known  causing management to have serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and may result in a future classification of the loan in one of the nonperforming asset categories

table of contents the following is a summary of the allowance for losses on other real estate owned for the years presented years ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of year acquisition of oreo disposition of oreo balance at end of year securities activity the securities portfolio of the company plays a primary role in management of the interest rate sensitivity of the company and  therefore  is managed in the context of the overall balance sheet 
the securities portfolio generates a substantial percentage of the company s interest income and serves as a necessary source of liquidity 
the company accounts for debt and equity securities as follows held to maturity htm 
debt securities that management has the current intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as htm and are carried at their remaining unpaid principal balance  net of unamortized premiums or unaccreted discounts 
premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted using the level interest yield method over the estimated remaining term of the underlying security 
available for sale afs 
debt and equity securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time  including securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest or prepayment rates  needs for liquidity and changes in the availability of and the yield of alternative investments are classified as afs 
these assets are carried at market value 
market value is determined using quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities or estimates from independent pricing services 
unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
purchase of premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities 
declines in the fair value of htm and afs securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method 
management attempts to deploy investable funds into instruments which are expected to provide a reasonable overall return on the portfolio given the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  while maintaining acceptable levels of capital  interest rate and liquidity risk 
at december   the securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets was and was larger than net loans which were of total assets

table of contents the following table sets forth the carrying amount of investment securities  mortgage backed securities and marketable equity securities at december   and december  in thousands available for sale us treasury us government agencies mortgage backed securities direct govt

agency issues total the company invests in mortgage backed and related securities  including mortgage participation certificates  which are insured or guaranteed by us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises  and collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits 
mortgage backed securities which also are known as mortgage participation certificates or pass through certificates represent a participation interest in a pool of single family or multi family mortgages  the principal and interest payments on which are passed from the mortgage originators  through intermediaries generally us government agencies  government sponsored enterprises  and direct whole loans that pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities  to investors such as the company 
us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises  which guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors  primarily include freddie mac  the federal national mortgage association the fnma and the government national mortgage association the gnma 
government sponsored enterprises are not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
freddie mac  fnma and federal home loan bank are the primary government sponsored enterprises with which the company purchases securities 
the whole loans the company purchases are all aaa rated collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduit tranches rated aaa due to credit support and or insurance coverage 
mortgage backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts  and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a range and have varying maturities 
the characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages  such as  fixed rate or adjustable rate  as well as prepayment risk  are passed on to the certificate holder 
the term of a mortgage backed pass through security thus approximates the term of the underlying mortgages 

table of contents the company s mortgage backed securities include collateralized mortgage obligations  which include securities issued by entities that have qualified under the internal revenue code of  as amended  as real estate mortgage investment conduits 
collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits collectively collateralized mortgage obligations have been developed in response to investor concerns regarding the uncertainty of cash flows associated with the prepayment option of the underlying mortgagor and are typically issued by governmental agencies  government sponsored enterprises and special purpose entities  such as trusts  corporations or partnerships  established by financial institutions or other similar institutions 
a collateralized mortgage obligation can be collateralized by loans or securities which are insured or guaranteed by fnma  freddie mac  gnma  or whole loans which  in the company s case  are all currently rated aaa 
in contrast to pass through mortgage backed securities  in which cash flow is received pro rata by all security holders  the cash flow from the mortgages underlying a collateralized mortgage obligation is segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined priority to investors holding various collateralized mortgage obligation classes 
by allocating the principal and interest cash flows from the underlying collateral among the separate collateralized mortgage obligation classes  different classes of bonds are created  each with its own stated maturity  estimated average life  coupon rate and prepayment characteristics 
like most fixed income securities  mortgage backed and related securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  unlike most fixed income securities  the mortgage loans underlying a mortgage backed or related security generally may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the ability to prepay a mortgage loan generally results in significantly increased price and yield volatility with respect to mortgage backed and related securities than is the case with non callable fixed income securities 
furthermore  mortgage backed derivative securities often are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayments than traditional mortgage backed securities and are  therefore  even more volatile 
the combined investment securities  mortgage backed securities  and marketable equity securities portfolio increased to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
mortgage backed securities increased million or during when compared to state and political subdivisions decreased million or during u

of the million increase in trust preferred securities  million are adjustable rate securities 
during  interest rates remained relatively low and the yield curve remained steep during the first half of the year but began to flatten during the second half of the company used this low interest rate environment to reposition a portion of the securities portfolio in an attempt to reduce the overall duration and minimize prepayment of premium mortgage backed securities 
higher coupon premium mortgage backed securities with high selling prices or with a potentially greater prepayment exposure were replaced with mortgage backed securities that had characteristics which potentially might reduce the prepayment exposure 
specific low selling yield and  or long duration municipal securities were sold and  in some circumstances  partially replaced with better call protected municipal securities 
the decrease in the municipal securities portfolio was due partially in response to the growth of the company s municipal loan portfolio and the amount of tax free income the company can support without being subject to alternative minimum tax long term 
the market value of the securities portfolio at december  was million  which represented a net unrealized gain on that date of million 
the net unrealized gain was comprised of million in unrealized gains and million of unrealized losses 
to the best of management s knowledge  none of the securities at december  had an other than temporary impairment 
net unrealized gains and losses on afs securities  which is a component of shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet  can fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in interest rates 
because management cannot predict the future direction of interest rates  the effect on shareholders equity in the future cannot be determined  however  this risk is monitored closely through the use of shock tests on the afs securities portfolio using an array of interest rate assumptions 

table of contents on january   the company transferred mortgage backed securities totaling million from afs to htm due to overall balance sheet strategies and potential changes in market conditions 
the unrealized loss on the securities transferred from afs to htm was  net of tax  at the date of transfer based on the fair value of the securities on the transfer date 
during the second quarter of  the company transferred mortgage backed securities totaling million from afs to htm 
the unrealized loss on the securities transferred from afs to htm was million  net of tax  during the second quarter based on the fair value of the securities on the transfer dates 
there were no securities transferred from afs to htm during the third and fourth quarters of the company has a significant amount of long term federal home loan bank of dallas fhlb fixed rate liabilities and determined it was appropriate that a portion of the company s securities portfolio should be designated htm 
at december   the company did not have any plans to transfer additional afs securities to htm 
should conditions change  the asset liability management committee alco may consider additional transfers in the future 
there were no sales from the htm portfolio during the years ended december   or there were million and million of securities classified as htm for the years ended december  and  respectively

during  the average interest rate on the adjustable rate trust preferred securities averaged  providing an interest savings when compared to the fixed rate trust preferred issue redeemed during the banking industry in texas the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment and other factors beyond the company s control 
during the last ten years the east texas economy has diversified  decreasing the overall impact of fluctuating oil prices  however  the east texas economy is still affected by the oil industry 
during  the economy in the company s market appeared to reflect stable growth 
as described above  an area of concern to the company is the personal bankruptcy rate 
management anticipates this could have some effect on the company s net charge offs 
management of the company  however  cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 

table of contents competition the activities engaged in by the company are highly competitive 
financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  insurance companies  brokerage companies and other financial institutions with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions compete vigorously for a share of the financial services market 
the company expects the number of financial institutions in the company s market area to continue to increase 
brokerage and insurance companies continue to become more competitive in the financial services arena and pose an ever increasing challenge to banks 
legislative changes also greatly affect the level of competition the company faces 
during  federal legislation allowed credit unions to expand their membership criteria 
this allows credit unions to use their expanded membership capabilities combined with tax free status to compete more fiercely for traditional bank business 
because banks do not enjoy a tax free status  credit unions have a competitive advantage 
additionally  the company must compete against several institutions located in east texas and elsewhere in the company s market area which have capital resources and legal loan limits substantially in excess of those available to the company 
the company faces competition from institutions that offer products and services the company does not or cannot currently offer 
some institutions the company competes with offer interest rate levels on loan and deposit products the company is unwilling to offer due to interest rate risk and overall profitability concerns 
the company expects the competition to increase

table of contents supervision and regulation banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
consequently  the company s growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by decisions of management and national and local economic conditions  but also by the statutes administered by  and the regulations and policies of  various governmental authorities 
these authorities include  but are not limited to  the federal reserve  the fdic  the tdb  united states department of treasury the treasury department  the internal revenue service and state taxing authorities 
the primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress has created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and the banking industry 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to the bank and the company establishes a comprehensive framework for the company s operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance funds  the bank s depositors and the public  rather than the company s shareholders and creditors 
the following summarizes some of the relevant laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies  but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed 
the company bank holding company act 
as bank holding companies under the bank holding company act of  as amended  the company and southside delaware are registered with and subject to regulation by the federal reserve 
the company and southside delaware are both required to file annual and other reports with  and furnish information to  the federal reserve  which makes periodic inspections of the company and southside delaware 
the bank holding company act provides that a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve i for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting stock in any bank or bank holding company  ii for the acquisition of substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company or iii in order to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company 
the bank holding company act also provides that  with certain exceptions  a bank holding company may not engage in any activities other than those of banking or managing or controlling banks and other authorized subsidiaries or own or control more than five percent of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank 
the federal reserve has deemed limited activities to be closely related to banking and therefore permissible for a bank holding company 
as discussed below  the gramm leach bliley act  which was enacted in  established a new type of bank holding company known as a financial holding company that has powers that are not otherwise available to bank holding companies 
the bank holding company act restricts the extension of credit to any bank holding company by its subsidiary bank 
federal regulatory agencies also have authority to regulate debt obligations other than commercial paper issued by bank holding companies 
this authority includes the power to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt obligations 
a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of services 
the federal reserve has cease and desist powers over bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries where their actions would constitute a serious threat to the safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank 
gramm leach bliley act 
traditionally  the activities of bank holding companies had been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking 
the gramm leach bliley financial services act of glba  which became effective on march   amended the bank holding company act and removed certain legal barriers separating the conduct of various types of financial services businesses 
in addition  glba substantially revamped the regulatory scheme within which financial institutions operate 

table of contents under glba  bank holding companies meeting certain eligibility requirements may elect to become a financial holding company 
a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature  as well as additional activities that the federal reserve or treasury department determine are financial in nature or incidental or complimentary to financial activities 
under glba  financial activities specifically include insurance  securities underwriting and dealing  merchant banking  investment advisory and lending activities 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company under glba if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdic improvement act prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
in addition  the bank holding company must file a declaration with the federal reserve that the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company 
a bank holding company that falls out of compliance with these requirements may be required to cease engaging in some of its activities 
in a similar manner  glba expanded the types of activities in which a bank may engage 
generally  a bank may engage in activities that are financial in nature through a financial subsidiary if the bank and each of its depository institution affiliates are well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
however  applicable law and regulation provide that the amount of investment in these activities generally are limited to of the total assets of the bank  and these investments are not aggregated with the bank for determining compliance with capital adequacy guidelines 
further  the transactions between the bank and this type of subsidiary are subject to a number of limitations 
under glba  the federal reserve serves as the primary umbrella regulator of financial holding companies  with supervisory authority over each parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries 
expanded financial activities of financial holding companies generally will be regulated according to the type of such financial activity banking activities by banking regulators  securities activities by securities regulators and insurance activities by insurance regulators 
glba also imposes additional restrictions and heightened disclosure requirements regarding private information collected by financial institutions 
the company has not elected to become a financial holding company and to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not make such an election in the future 
interstate banking 
federal banking law generally provides that a bank holding company may acquire or establish banks in any state of the united states  subject to certain age and deposit concentration limits 
in addition  texas banking laws permit a bank holding company that owns stock of a bank located outside the state of texas to acquire a bank or bank holding company located in texas 
this type of acquisition may occur only if the texas bank to be directly or indirectly controlled by the out of state bank holding company has existed and continuously operated as a bank for a period of at least five years 
in any event  a bank holding company may not own or control banks in texas the deposits of which would exceed of the total deposits of all federally insured deposits in texas 
the company has no present plans to acquire or establish banks outside the state of texas but has not eliminated the possibility of doing so 
sound banking practice 
bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsound banking practices 
for example  the federal reserve s regulation y requires a bank holding company to give the federal reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the bank holding company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation 
as another example  a bank holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non banking subsidiaries or their customers if the federal reserve believed it not prudent to do so 
the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  or firrea  expanded the federal reserve s authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or 
table of contents regulations 
firrea increased the amount of civil money penalties which the federal reserve can assess for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
the penalties can be as high as  for each day the activity continues 
firrea expanded the scope of individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed 
anti tying restrictions 
bank holding companies and affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services  such as extensions of credit  to other services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates 
capital adequacy 
the federal reserve monitors the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  such as southside delaware and the company  and the fdic monitors the capital adequacy of the bank 
the federal bank regulators use a combination of risk based guidelines and leverage ratios to evaluate capital adequacy and consider the company s and the bank s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the company and the bank 
the federal reserve s capital adequacy regulations are based upon a risk based capital determination  whereby a bank holding company s capital adequacy is determined in light of the risk  both on and off balance sheet  contained in the bank holding company s assets 
different categories of assets are assigned risk weightings and are counted at a percentage of their book value 
the regulations divide capital between tier capital core capital and tier capital 
for a bank holding company  tier capital consists primarily of common stock  related surplus  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying cumulative preferred securities 
goodwill and certain other intangibles are excluded from tier capital 
tier capital consists of an amount equal to the allowance for loan and lease losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  limited other types of preferred stock not included in tier capital  hybrid capital instruments and term subordinated debt 
investments in and loans to unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries that constitute capital of those subsidiaries are excluded from capital 
the sum of tier and tier capital constitutes qualifying total capital  and the tier component must comprise at least of qualifying total capital 
under regulatory capital guidelines  the company must maintain a minimum tier capital ratio of at least and a minimum total capital ratio of at least 
in addition  banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage capital ratio of at least for the most highly rated  financially sound banks and bank holding companies and a minimum leverage ratio of at least for all other banks 
as of december   the company s total risk based capital ratio was  the company s tier risk based capital ratio was and the company s leverage capital ratio was 
the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory level  without significant reliance on intangible assets and that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is the ratio of tier capital  less intangibles not deducted from tier capital  to quarterly average total assets 
as of december   the federal reserve had not advised the company of any specific minimum tangible tier leverage ratio applicable to the company 
dividends 
as a bank holding company that does not  as an entity  currently engage in separate business activities of a material nature  the company s ability to pay cash dividends depends upon the cash dividends it receives from the bank through southside delaware 
the company s sources of income are dividends paid by the bank 
the company must pay all of its operating expenses from funds the company receives from the bank 
therefore  shareholders may receive dividends from the company only to the extent that funds are available after payment of the company s operating expenses 
in addition  in november the federal reserve adopted a policy statement concerning payment of cash dividends  which generally prohibits bank holding companies from paying dividends except out of 
table of contents operating earnings  and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the company is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that the company maintain an adequate level of capital as described above and serve as a source of strength for the bank 
change in bank control act 
under the change in bank control act  persons who intend to acquire control of a bank holding company  either directly or indirectly  must give days prior notice to the federal reserve 
control would exist when an acquiring party directly or indirectly has control of at least of the company s voting securities or the power to direct the management or policies of the company 
under federal reserve regulations  a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where  after the transaction  the acquiring party has ownership control or the power to vote at least but less than of the company s voting securities 
the bank the bank is subject to various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of texas  and to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the tdb and the fdic 
the tdb and the fdic have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking statutes and regulations 
these requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits  restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of the bank 
regulation of lending activities 
loans made by the bank are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations  including the truth in lending act  federal consumer credit protection act  the texas finance code  the texas consumer credit code  the texas consumer protection code  the equal credit opportunity act  the real estate settlement procedures act and adjustable rate mortgage disclosure requirements 
remedies to the borrower or consumer and penalties to the bank are provided if the bank fails to comply with these laws and regulations 
the scope and requirements of these laws and regulations have expanded significantly in recent years 
dividends 
all dividends paid by the bank are paid to the company  the sole indirect shareholder of the bank  through southside delaware 
the general dividend policy of the bank is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining liquidity and preserving applicable capital ratios and servicing obligations 
the dividend policy of the bank is subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the bank and will depend upon such factors as future earnings  financial conditions  cash needs  capital adequacy  compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and general business conditions 
the ability of the bank  as a texas banking association  to pay dividends is restricted under applicable law and regulations 
the bank generally may not pay a dividend reducing its capital and surplus without the prior approval of the texas banking commissioner 
all dividends must be paid out of net profits then on hand  after deducting expenses  including losses and provisions for loan losses 
the fdic has the right to prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank where the payment is deemed to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the bank is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirements that it maintain an adequate level of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by the fdic 
the exact amount of future dividends on the stock of the bank will be a function of the profitability of the bank in general  applicable tax rates in effect from year to year and the discretion of the board of directors of the bank 
the bank s ability to pay dividends in the future will directly depend on the bank s future profitability  which cannot be accurately estimated or assured 
capital adequacy 
in  the federal banking regulators promulgated capital adequacy regulations to which all national and state banks  such as the bank  are subject 
these requirements are similar to the federal reserve requirements promulgated with respect to bank holding companies 
table of contents discussed previously 
at december   the bank was well capitalized and had a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a leverage capital ratio of 
the bank is regulated by the tdb and the fdic 
the fdic requires minimum levels of tier capital and risk based capital for fdic insured institutions 
the fdic requires a minimum leverage ratio of of adjusted total assets for the highest rated banks 
other banks are required to meet a leverage standard of or more  determined on a case by case basis 
on december   the minimum ratio for qualifying total risk based capital was of which must be tier capital 
southside bank s actual capital to total assets and risk based capital ratios at december  were in excess of the minimum requirements 
also see discussion of capital resources under item prompt corrective action 
banks are subject to restrictions on their activities depending on their level of capital 
the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations divides banks into five different categories  depending on their level of capital 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a core capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more  and if the bank is not subject to an order or capital directive to meet and maintain a certain capital level 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a core capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more unless it receives the highest composite rating at its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  in which instance it must maintain a leverage ratio of or more 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a core capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a risk based capital ratio of less than  a core capital ratio of less than and a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 
in addition  the fdic has the ability to downgrade a bank s classification but not to critically undercapitalized based on other considerations even if the bank meets the capital guidelines 
if a state nonmember bank  such as the bank  is classified as undercapitalized  the bank is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the fdic 
an undercapitalized bank is prohibited from increasing its assets  engaging in a new line of business  acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution  or opening or acquiring a new branch office  except under certain circumstances  including the acceptance by the fdic of a capital restoration plan for the bank 
if a state nonmember bank is classified as undercapitalized  the fdic may take certain actions to correct the capital position of the bank 
if a bank is classified as significantly undercapitalized  the fdic would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions 
these actions would include  among other things  requiring sales of new securities to bolster capital  improvements in management  limits on interest rates paid  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  termination of certain risky activities and restrictions on compensation paid to executive officers 
if a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized  the bank must be placed into conservatorship or receivership within days  unless the fdic determines otherwise 
the capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank 
the fdic is required to conduct a full scope  on site examination of every bank at least once every twelve months 
banks also may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits  depending on their capital classification 
well capitalized banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits  but all banks that are not well capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 

table of contents community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods served by the bank 
the community reinvestment act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit the bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
on a periodic basis  the fdic is charged with preparing a written evaluation of the bank s record of meeting the credit needs of the entire community and assigning a rating 
the bank regulatory agencies will take that record into account in their evaluation of any application made by the bank or the company for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
an unsatisfactory community reinvestment act rating may be used as the basis to deny an application 
in addition  as discussed above  a bank holding company may not become a financial holding company unless each of its subsidiary banks have a community reinvestment act rating of at least satisfactory 
the bank was last examined for compliance with the community reinvestment act on april  and received a rating of outstanding 
deposit insurance 
the bank s deposits are insured up to  per depositor by the bank insurance fund 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by the bank 
the fdic assesses insurance premiums on a bank s deposits at a variable rate depending on the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the bank 
the fdic determines the deposit insurance assessment rates on the basis of the bank s capital classification and supervisory evaluations 
there is currently a basis point spread between the highest and the lowest assessment rates  so that banks classified as strongest were subject in to assessment  and banks classified as weakest were subject to an assessment rate of 
in addition to the insurance assessment  each insured bank was subject in to an assessment on deposits to service debt issued by the financing corporation  a federal agency established to finance the recapitalization of the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
under these assessment criteria  the bank was required to pay annual deposit premiums to the bank insurance fund in the bank s deposits insurance assessments may increase or decrease depending upon the risk assessment classification to which the bank is assigned by the federal deposits insurance corporation 
any increase in insurance assessments could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings 
usa patriot act 
following the events of september   president bush  on october   signed into law the united and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of also known as the usa patriot act  the law enhances the powers of the federal government and law enforcement organizations to combat terrorism  organized crime and money laundering 
the usa patriot act significantly amends and expands the application of the bank secrecy act  including enhanced measures regarding customer identity  new suspicious activity reporting rules and enhanced anti money laundering programs 
under the act  each financial institution is required to establish and maintain anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs  which include  at a minimum  the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test programs 
in addition  the act requires the bank regulatory agencies to consider the record of a bank or bank holding company in combating money laundering activities in their evaluation of bank and bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions 
on april   the treasury department issued regulations under the usa patriot act 
the regulations state that a depository institution will be deemed in compliance with the act provided it continues to comply with the current bank secrecy act regulations 
transactions with affiliates 
transactions between the bank and any of their affiliates including the company are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
an affiliate of a bank 
table of contents is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution is not treated as an affiliate of a bank for purposes of sections a and b unless it engages in activities not permissible for a national bank to engage in directly 
generally  sections a and b i limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  and limit such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus  and ii require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans to an affiliate  the purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate  the purchase of assets from an affiliate  the issuance of a guarantee for the benefit of an affiliate  and similar transactions 
most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the nature of the collateral 
in addition  any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
the bank is also restricted in the loans that it may make to its executive officers  and directors  the executive officers and directors of the company  any owner of or more of its stock or the stock of the company  and certain entities affiliated with any such person 
on october   the federal reserve issued a new regulation  regulation w  effective april   that comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act  which are intended to protect insured depository institutions from suffering losses arising from transactions with affiliates 
the regulation unifies and updates staff interpretations issued over the years  incorporates several new interpretative proposals such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate and addresses new issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of nonbanking activities engaged in by banks and bank holding companies in recent years and authorized for financial holding companies under glba 
branch banking 
pursuant to the texas finance code  all banks located in texas are authorized to branch statewide 
accordingly  a bank located anywhere in texas has the ability  subject to regulatory approval  to establish branch facilities near any of the bank s facilities and within the bank s market area 
if other banks were to establish branch facilities near the bank s facilities  it is uncertain whether these branch facilities would have a material adverse effect on the business of the bank 
in  congress adopted the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of that statute provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching  subject to certain aging and deposit concentration limits that may be imposed under applicable state laws 
texas law permits interstate branching in two manners  with certain exceptions 
first  a financial institution with its main office outside of texas may establish a branch in the state of texas by acquiring a financial institution located in texas that is at least five years old  so long as the resulting institution and its affiliates would not hold more than of the total deposits in the state after the acquisition 
in addition  a financial institution with its main office outside of texas generally may establish a branch in the state of texas on a de novo basis if the financial institution s main office is located in a state that would permit texas institutions to establish a branch on a de novo basis in that state 
the fdic has adopted regulations under the reigle neal act to prohibit an out of state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production 
these regulations include guidelines to insure that interstate branches operated by an out of state bank in a host state are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the out of state bank 
enforcement authority 
the federal banking laws also contain civil and criminal penalties available for use by the appropriate regulatory agency against certain institution affiliated parties primarily including management  employees and agents of a financial institution  as well as independent 
table of contents contractors such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution s affairs and who caused or are likely to cause more than minimum financial loss to or a significant adverse affect on the institution  who knowingly or recklessly violate a law or regulation  breach a fiduciary duty or engage in unsafe or unsound practices 
these practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the submission of inaccurate reports 
these laws authorize the appropriate banking agency to issue cease and desist orders that may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnification or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets or take other action as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate 
governmental monetary policies 
the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  control of borrowings  open market operations  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks  deposits and assets of foreign branches  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates which member banks may pay on time and savings deposits are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve 
those monetary policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of all bank loans  investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits 
the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the company  therefore  cannot be predicted accurately 
annual audits 
every bank with total assets in excess of million  such as the bank  must have an annual independent audit made of the bank s financial statements by a certified public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the fdic 
all of the above laws and regulations add to the cost of the company s operations and thus have a negative impact on profitability 
it should be noted that there has been a tremendous expansion experienced in recent years by financial service providers that are not subject to the same rules and regulations as are applicable to southside delaware and the company 
the company s management and the bank s management cannot predict what other legislation might be enacted or what other regulations might be adopted and the effects thereof on the company and the bank 
usury laws texas usury laws limit the rate of interest that may be charged by state banks 
certain federal laws provide a limited preemption of texas usury laws 
the maximum rate of interest that southside bank may charge on direct business loans under texas law varies between per annum and i per annum for business and agricultural loans above  or ii per annum for other direct loans 
texas floating usury ceilings are tied to the week united states treasury bill auction rate 
other ceilings apply to open end credit card loans and dealer paper purchased by the company 
a federal statute removes interest ceilings under usury laws for loans by the company that are secured by first liens on residential real property 
economic environment the monetary policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve  have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
the federal reserve regulates the national supply of bank credit 
among the means available to the federal reserve are open market operations in united states government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  changes in reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits  and loans and limitations on interest rates which member banks may pay on time or demand deposits 
these methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits

forward looking information certain statements of other than historical fact that are contained in this document and in written material  press releases and oral statements issued by or on behalf of southside bancshares  inc  the company a bank holding company  may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may include words such as expect  estimate  project  anticipate  believe  could  should  may  intend  probability  risk  target  objective and similar expressions 
forward looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
for example  certain market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
see item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  actual income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  either in the state of texas  nationally or globally  legislation or regulatory changes which adversely affect the businesses in which the company is engaged  adverse changes in government sponsored enterprises the gse s status or financial condition impacting the gse s guarantees or ability to pay or issue debt  economic or other disruptions caused by acts of terrorism or military actions in iraq  afghanistan or other areas  changes in the interest rate yield curve or interest rate environment which reduce interest margins and may impact prepayments on the mortgage backed securities portfolio  changes effecting the leverage strategy  significant increases in competition in the banking and financial services industry  changes in consumer spending  borrowing and saving habits  technological changes  the company s ability to increase market share and control expenses  the effect of compliance with legislation or regulatory changes  the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices and the costs and effects of unanticipated litigation 
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting estimates of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance for losses on loans represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans is increased by the provision for losses on loans charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for losses on loans is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current and anticipated economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experience  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 

table of contents the loan loss allowance is based on the most current review of the loan portfolio at that time 
the servicing officer has the primary responsibility for updating significant changes in a customer s financial position 
each officer prepares status updates on any credit deemed to be experiencing repayment difficulties which  in the officer s opinion  would place the collection of principal or interest in doubt 
the internal loan review department for the company is responsible for an ongoing review of the company s entire loan portfolio with specific goals set for the volume of loans to be reviewed on an annual basis 
at each review of a credit  a subjective analysis methodology is used to grade the respective loan 
categories of grading vary in severity to include loans which do not appear to have a significant probability of loss at the time of review to grades which indicate a probability that the entire balance of the loan will be uncollectible 
if full collection of the loan balance appears unlikely at the time of review  estimates or appraisals of the collateral securing the debt are used to allocate the necessary allowances 
a list of loans or loan relationships of  or more  which are graded as having more than the normal degree of risk associated with them  is maintained by the internal loan review officer 
this list is updated on a periodic basis  but no less than quarterly in order to properly allocate necessary allowance and keep management informed on the status of attempts to correct the deficiencies noted in the credit 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions eg  discount rates and methodologies eg  comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for losses on loans and the associated provision for loan losses 
as of december   the company s review of the loan portfolio indicated that a loan loss allowance of million was adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
refer to item entitled loan loss experience and allowance for loan loss and notes to financial statements no 
 summary of significant accounting and reporting policies for a detailed description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
estimation of fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including available for sale investment securities and other real estate owned 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 

table of contents fair values for most available for sale investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or estimates from independent pricing services 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
defined benefit pension plan 
the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit pension plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plan 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s plan were discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets  and assumed salary increases 
material changes in pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the level of benefits provided  changes in the discount rates  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plan and other factors 
impairment of investment securities and mortgage backed securities 
investment and mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair values and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of equity 
in addition  securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are subject to the company s review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value  credit event or interest rate related  the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
overview operating results during the year ended december   the company s net income increased million  or  to million  from million for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income and a decrease in interest expense 
interest income increased primarily from increases in interest income on mortgage backed and related securities 
interest expense decreased primarily from decreases in the interest expense on deposits and long term obligations 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in noninterest income and increases in noninterest expenses and income taxes 
the decreases in noninterest income were primarily a result of decreases in gain on sale of securities available for sale and decreases in gain on sale of loans 
the majority of the increase in noninterest expense was a result of increases in salaries and employee benefits due to normal payroll increases  staff increases due to opening new branches  and higher benefit costs 
there was also a significant increase in professional fees 
earnings per fully diluted share were and  respectively  for the years ended december  and 
table of contents financial condition total assets increased million or to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in the securities portfolio and a million increase in net loans 
the securities portfolio totaled million at december  compared to million at december  at december   net loans were million compared to million at december  the increase in securities and loans was funded by increases in deposits and fhlb advances

table of contents shareholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase primarily reflects the net income recorded for the year ended december   and the increase in the common stock issued of million as a result of the company s incentive stock option and dividend reinvestment plans 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of the outstanding common stock at an average price of per share  the payment of cash dividends and a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million 
the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is composed of a million  net of tax  unrealized loss on securities  net of reclassification adjustment see note and a million  net of tax  minimum pension liability adjustment 
during the economy in the company s market area appeared to reflect stable growth 
one area of concern is the personal bankruptcy rate 
management expects the personal bankruptcy rate could have some effect on the company s net charge offs 
management of the company  however  cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 
key financial indicators management follows include but are not limited to  numerous interest rate sensitivity and interest rate risk indicators  credit risk  operations risk  liquidity risk  capital risk  regulatory risk  competition risk  yield curve risk  and economic risk 

table of contents leverage strategy in may the company implemented a leverage strategy designed with the potential to enhance its profitability by maximizing the use of the company s capital with acceptable levels of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
the leverage strategy consists of borrowing a combination of long and short term funds from the fhlb and investing the funds primarily in premium mortgage backed securities  and to a lesser extent  long term municipal securities 
although premium mortgage backed securities often carry lower yields than traditional mortgage loans and other types of loans the company makes  these securities generally increase the overall quality of the company s assets by virtue of the securities underlying insurance or guarantees  are more liquid than individual loans and may be used to collateralize the company s borrowings or other obligations 
in addition  in low interest rate environments the amortization expense for premium mortgage backed securities is associated with substantially higher prepayments experienced and reduces the overall yields of the premium mortgage backed securities portfolio 
while the strategy of investing a substantial portion of the company s assets in premium mortgage backed and municipal securities has resulted in lower interest rate spreads and margins  the company believes that the lower operating expenses and reduced credit risk combined with the managed interest rate risk of this strategy have enhanced its overall profitability over the last several years 
at this time  the company maintains the leverage strategy for the purpose of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of the company s capital 
risks associated with the asset structure the company maintains are a lower net interest rate spread and margin when compared to its peers  changes in the yield curve  and increased interest rate risk 
during and continuing into the first two months of  the yield curve has flattened significantly 
during this flattening curve cycle  there has been a combination of increasing short term interest rates combined with relatively flat to decreasing long term years and out interest rates 
should this trend in the yield curve continue  the company may not see prepayment speeds on its mortgage backed securities slow and could see prepayment speeds increase 
in addition  at the same time the company could see its funding costs rise 
increased prepayment speeds and rising funding costs would most likely squeeze the company s net interest margin 
the company s asset structure  spread and margin increases the need to monitor the company s interest rate risk 
an additional risk is the change in market value of the afs securities portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
significant increases in interest rates could impact the company s equity capital significantly 
the company will attempt to adopt a balance sheet strategy going forward to manage the securities portfolio as a percentage of earning assets in combination with adequate quality loan growth available in the company s market area 
if adequate quality loan growth is not available to achieve the company s goal of enhancing profitability by maximizing the use of the company s capital  as described above  then additional securities will be purchased if they can be purchased at what the company believes are acceptable margins 
if acceptable securities are not available to purchase  the company could reduce the level of securities through maturities of securities  principal payments and  or sales of securities 
during  sufficient quality loan growth was not available at a market price the company was willing to accept 
as a result  the securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets increased to at december  from at december  on the liability side  the company will continue to utilize a combination of advances and deposits to achieve its strategy of minimizing cost while achieving overall interest rate risk objectives as well as alco objectives 
during the interest rate environment  long term deposits necessary to balance alco objectives  as a result of long term assets added to the balance sheet  were not available in the company s market area at a market price the company was willing to accept 
as a result  fhlb borrowings as a percentage of deposits increased to at december  from at december  the increase in fhlb advances were primarily long term advances 
the intended net result of the overall balance sheet strategy is to increase the company s net interest spread 
the leverage strategy is dynamic and requires ongoing management 
as interest rates  yield curves  funding costs and security spreads change  the company s determination of the proper securities  proper amount of securities to own and funding to obtain must be re evaluated 
management has attempted to design the leverage strategy so that in a rising interest rate environment the interest income earned on the premium mortgage backed securities may increase to help offset the increase in funding costs 
if the flattening yield curve cycle trend discussed above continues  the overall yield on the mortgage backed securities may not increase and could decrease 
if all interest rates were to decrease  the interest income on the premium mortgage backed securities may decrease due to increased prepayments on these securities as funding costs decrease 
due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments  the length of interest rate cycles  and 
table of contents the slope of the interest rate yield curve  net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under the alco scenarios modeled 
results of operations the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s noninterest income  provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  changes in interest rate yield curves  prepayment rates of mortgage backed securities and loans  repricing of loan relationships  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
comparison of operating results for the years ending december  compared to december  net interest income net interest income is one of the principal sources of a financial institution s earnings stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates or interest rate yield curves as well as volume and mix changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities materially impact net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to the same period in the overall increase in net interest income was primarily the result of increases in mortgage backed and related securities and taxable investment securities combined with a decrease in interest expense on deposits and long term obligations 
during the year ended december   total interest income increased million or  as a result of an increase in average interest earning assets of million or  which more than offset the slight decrease in average yield on average interest earning assets from at december  to at december  total interest expense decreased million or to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average yield on interest bearing liabilities december   to from for the same period in which was partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million or 
net interest income increased during as a result of increases in the company s net interest margin and spread during the year ended december  to and  respectively when compared to and  respectively for the same period in  which was due to several factors 
the higher overall interest rate environment during when compared to  contributed to a decrease in residential mortgage refinancing nationwide and in the company s market area 
this decrease in prepayments on mortgage loans combined with a restructuring of the securities portfolio reduced overall amortization expense which contributed to the increase in interest income 
a return to long term interest rate levels experienced in may and june of could impact the company s net interest margin in the future due to increased prepayments and repricings 
other factors that impacted the company s net interest margin and spread included a reduction in interest expense on the company s trust preferred securities during the year ended december  of million or and a decrease in the interest expense on the company s interest bearing deposits of million or 
partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense was an increase in interest expense on long term fhlb advances of  or due to the increase in the average balance outstanding 

table of contents during the year ended december   average loans  funded by the growth in average deposits  increased million or  compared to the same period in the average yield on loans decreased from at december  to at december  the decrease in the yield on loans was reflective of the repricing characteristics of the loans  interest rates at the time the loans repriced  and the competitive loan pricing environment 
if interest rates remain low or move lower the company anticipates it will be required to continue to meet lower interest rate offers from competing financial institutions in order to retain quality loan relationships  which could continue to impact the overall loan yield 
the decrease in interest income on loans of  or was the result of the decrease in the average yield on loans which was partially offset by the increase in average loans 
average investment and mortgage backed securities increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily funded by an increase in fhlb advances and an increase in average deposits 
the overall yield on average investment and mortgage backed securities increased to during the year ended december  from during the same period in  due in large part to decreased prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities which led to decreased amortization expense 
interest income on investment and mortgage backed securities increased million in or compared to due to an increase in both the average yield and the average balance on securities during interest income from marketable equity securities  federal funds and other interest earning assets decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to primarily as a result of lower average interest rates paid on fhlb stock during during the year ended december  securities increased more than loans 
as a result  the mix of the company s average interest earning assets reflected a decrease in average total loans as a percentage of total average interest earning assets compared to the prior year end as loans averaged during compared to during  a direct result of less loan growth when compared to the growth in securities 
securities averaged of average total interest earning assets and other interest earning asset categories averaged for december  during the comparable mix was in securities and in the other interest earning asset categories 
total interest expense decreased million or to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average yield on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million or

as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on 
table of contents the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
management of liquidity liquidity management involves the ability to convert assets to cash with a minimum of loss 
the company must be capable of meeting its obligations to its customers at any time 
this means addressing the immediate cash withdrawal requirements of depositors and other funds providers  the funding requirements of all lines and letters of credit  and the short term credit needs of customers 
liquidity is provided by short term investments that can be readily liquidated with a minimum risk of loss 
cash  interest earning deposits  federal funds sold and short term investments with maturities or repricing characteristics of one year or less continue to be a substantial percentage of total assets 
at december   these investments were of total assets  as compared with for december   and for december  liquidity is further provided through the matching  by time period  of rate sensitive interest earning assets with rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
the company has three lines of credit for the purchase of federal funds 
two million and one million unsecured lines of credit have been established with bank of america  frost bank and texas independent bank  respectively 
the company has obtained a million letter of credit from fhlb as collateral for a portion of the company s public funds deposits 
the alco of the bank closely monitors various liquidity ratios  interest rate spreads and margins  interest rate shock reports and market value of portfolio equity with rates shocked plus and minus basis points to ensure the company a satisfactory liquidity position 
market value of portfolio equity is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
market value of portfolio equity analysis is one of the general measures used by regulatory authorities for assessing an institution s interest rate risk 
the extent to which assets will gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities and or interest rate contracts determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
such market value analysis is intended to evaluate the impact of immediate and sustained parallel interest rate shifts of the current yield curve upon the market value of the current balance sheet 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank attempts to determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mix to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios 
the bank uses fhlb as a significant source of liquidity 
fhlb advances are collateralized by fhlb stock  nonspecified real estate loans and securities 
if this source of funding were not available the costs associated with obtaining funding to replace fhlb advances maturing could be more expensive or could be unavailable 
in the event alternative funding was not available  sales of securities would be necessary to provide liquidity which could impact net income 

table of contents the bank issues letters of credit and has unfunded loan commitments and lines of credit 
if all of these were to fund at one time the company would need to draw on some of it s sources of liquidity which would include fhlb advances  federal funds purchase lines  brokered cd s  or the sale of securities 
off balance sheet arrangements  commitments and contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments for borrowings do not include interest

the total balance of debt was million at december  with a scheduled maturity date of the rate of interest for the first quarter of associated with this debt is 
the company had fhlb advances with maturity dates ranging from through  with a total balance of  at december  the company had various operating leases for its office machines that total  and expire on or before the end of in addition  the company has operating leases totaling million on its retail branch locations and mortgage lending center which have future commitments of up to five years and additional options  the company controls  beyond the commitment period 
the bank has deferred compensation agreements the agreements with seven officers of the company and the bank totaling million 
payments from the agreements are to commence at the time of retirement 
as of december   no payments had been made from such agreements 
of the seven officers included in the agreements  two were eligible for retirement at december  and one is eligible for retirement in april all other officers are eligible at various dates after five years 
the totals reflected under five years assume the two eligible officers retired at december  and the officer eligible in will retire at the scheduled retirement date 
additional information regarding executive compensation is presented in item of this annual report on form k 
the contractual amounts and expected maturities of loan commitments and standby letters of credit are as of december  the commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
included in the less than one year category are unused commitments for credit card and ready reserve of million  which have no stated maturity date and therefore are not expected to expire 
the company expects to contribute million to its defined benefit plans during the company also expects to contribute to its defined benefit plans in future years  however  those amounts are indeterminable at this time 
the table on page shows the expected maturities for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
the primary objective of monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity  or risk  is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates 
federal reserve monetary control efforts  the effects of deregulation and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of managing interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
the table on page shows interest sensitivity gaps for four different intervals as of december  in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position 
the company primarily uses two methods for measuring and analyzing interest rate risk net income simulation analysis and market value of portfolio equity modeling 
through these simulations the company attempts to estimate the impact on net interest income of a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
policy guidelines limit the estimated change in net interest income to percent of forecasted net income over the succeeding months and basis point parallel rate shock 
policy guidelines limit the change in market value of equity in a basis point parallel rate shock to percent of the base case 
the results of the valuation analysis as of december   were within policy guidelines 
due to the level of interest at december   many of the interest rates cannot move down basis points 
as part of the overall assumptions  certain assets and liabilities have been given reasonable floors 
in the present interest rate environment  management is primarily focusing on the shock down basis points and the shock up and basis points 
this type of simulation analysis requires numerous assumptions including but not limited to changes in balance sheet mix  prepayment rates on mortgage related assets and fixed rate loans  cash flows and repricings of all financial instruments  changes in volumes and pricing  future shapes of the yield curve  relationship of market interest rates to each other basis risk  credit spread and deposit sensitivity 
assumptions are based on management s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain changes in interest rates 

table of contents the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

table of contents residential fixed rate loans are assumed to have annual prepayment rates between and of the portfolio 
residential adjustable rate loans are assumed to have annual prepayment rates between and 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
consumer loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
commercial loans are assumed to prepay at an annual rate between and 
municipal loans are assumed to prepay at an annual rate between and 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
at december   the contractual maturity of substantially all of the company s mortgage backed or related securities was in excess of ten years 
the actual maturity of a mortgage backed or related security is less than its stated maturity due to regular principal payments and prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and affect its yield to maturity 
the yield to maturity is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the security 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans  which decrease and increase interest income  respectively 
the prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage backed or related security  and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  including the type of mortgages  the coupon rate  the age of mortgages  the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of falling mortgage interest rates  if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans  refinancing may increase and accelerate the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security 
at december   of the million of mortgage backed and related securities held by the company  all were secured by fixed rate mortgage loans 
the company assumes of savings accounts and transaction accounts at december   are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the company assumes of money market accounts at december  are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the company does not consider any of its platinum money market accounts as core deposits 
no roll off rate is applied to certificates of deposit 
fixed maturity deposits reprice at maturity 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels associated with mortgage backed securities may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk

the alco of the bank monitors the desired gap along with various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for the company 
management continually evaluates the condition of the economy  the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities 
using this analysis  management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of interest rates 
regulatory authorities also monitor the bank s gap position along with other liquidity ratios 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios
