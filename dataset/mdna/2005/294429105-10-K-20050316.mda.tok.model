item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  change in control agreements 
we have change in control agreements with certain of our key officers 
these agreements have renewable five year terms and become effective only upon a change in control of equifax 
a change in control is generally defined by the agreements to mean i an accumulation by any person  entity or group of or more of the combined voting power of equifax s voting stock  or ii a business combination resulting in the shareholders immediately prior to the combination owning less than two thirds of the common stock and combined voting power of the new company  iii a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of equifax s assets  or iv a complete liquidation or dissolution of equifax 
if any of these events occur and the officer s employment terminates within three years after the date of the change in control  other than from death  disability or termination for cause or voluntary termination other than for good reason  the officer will be entitled to receive a unpaid compensation accrued through the date of termination  b three times the sum of i the officer s highest annual salary for the twelve months prior to termination  and ii the officer s highest bonus for the three years prior to termination  c additional compensation and service credit under retirement plans to age five years maximum additional service credit  and d continuation of group health  dental  vision  life  disability  k and similar coverages for three years 
benefits payable under these agreements and other compensation or benefit plans of equifax are not reduced to satisfy the limits of section g of the internal revenue code 
as a result  any payments the officer receives will be increased  if necessary  so that after taking into account all taxes the officer would incur as a result of those payments  the officer would receive the same after tax amount he or she would have received had no excise tax been imposed under section of the code 
assuming a change in control had occurred on december   and employment had been terminated on that date  the approximate payments that would have been made under the change in control agreements not including the gross up portion would have been million  and the officers unvested outstanding stock options and restricted stock units would have become fully vested 
the amount of the gross up  if any  to be paid may be substantial and will depend upon numerous factors  including the price per share of equifax common stock and the extent  if any  that payments or benefits made to the officers constitute excess parachute payments within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
guarantees 
we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit  performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business 
the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby of all letters of credit is less than million and all have a maturity of less than one year 
guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of operating units 
the only outstanding guarantee that is not reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets was extended in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings  llc rma in october  at which time we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan 
the operating lease  which expires december   has a remaining balance of million based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments at december  our obligations under such guarantee are not secured 
we believe the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expect no material losses to occur in connection with these instruments 
subsidiary dividends and fund transfers 
the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments  which do not  individually or in the aggregate  materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness  meet our current obligations or pay dividends 
litigation 
in november  the landlord of our former headquarters facility brought an action  peachtree  llc v 
equifax inc  against us in the superior court of fulton county  georgia  which asserted claims related to our guaranty obligations under our lease termination agreement 
this lawsuit seeks damages  of approximately million  substantially all of which represents future rent contingencies  and punitive damages 
on motions for summary judgment  the superior court ruled against our discharge defense and against plaintiff s fraud claim 
on june   the georgia court of appeals affirmed the superior court s rulings 
both parties appealed these rulings to the georgia supreme court  which on september  declined to hear the appeals 
the remaining issues in the case will now be tried in superior court 
trial is set to commence on may  we intend to continue to contest in the superior court the damages claimed by the plaintiff 
in the third quarter of  the canada revenue agency cra issued notices of reassessment asserting that acrofax  inc  a wholly owned canadian subsidiary of equifax  is liable for additional tax for the through tax years  related to certain intercompany capital contributions and loans 
in  acrofax invested uk million pounds in luxembourg sa  a luxembourg subsidiary of equifax lux  which subsequently lent that amount to equifax plc  a uk subsidiary of equifax 
in june  acrofax distributed via dividend shares of lux to equifax credit information services  inc another subsidiary of equifax 
the cra claimed that by using lux as an intermediary  acrofax avoided paying tax on interest earned on the loan to equifax plc and is therefore taxable on the dividends it received from lux  and in the alternative  the transactions should be recharacterized as a loan directly from acrofax to equifax plc and tax should be paid by acrofax on the amount of interest income that it would have received from such a loan as well as withholding tax on the loan principal 
the additional tax sought by the cra for these periods ranges  based on alternative theories  from million to million  plus interest and penalties 
acrofax has filed notices of objection in response to the notices 
on september   we paid a statutorily required deposit of million against the cra s primary assessment theory 
we intend to vigorously contest these reassessments and do not believe we have violated any statutory provision or rule 
on december   equifax and naviant served a demand for arbitration alleging  among other things  that the shareholder sellers of naviant had breached various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of naviant in the arbitration demand seeks rescission of our naviant purchase and the recovery of the purchase price or  in the alternative  recovery of monetary damages on various grounds 
on march   we recommenced our demand for arbitration in order to utilize the procedures of the american arbitration association 
some of the respondents have answered and denied liability 
the arbitration has been stayed by agreement pending determination of the motions noted in the litigation described in the next paragraph 
we cannot at this time predict the probable outcome of this matter 
on april   in a case captioned softbank capital partners lp  et al 
v 
equifax inc and naviant  inc  certain of the former shareholders of naviant filed suit in the us district court for the southern district of florida seeking declaratory relief to prevent equifax and naviant from proceeding with the arbitration discussed in the the preceding paragraph  except for claims asserted against softbank capital partners lp  as shareholders representative  for certain indemnified losses capped at the amount of a million escrow fund specified in the agreement pursuant to which equifax acquired naviant 
the parties are awaiting rulings on the issues presented by the motion for summary judgment filed by plaintiffs and the motion to dismiss filed by equifax and naviant 
although equifax believes it and naviant have substantial factual and legal defenses to plaintiffs claims  we cannot at this time predict the probable outcome of this matter 
on august   in a case captioned equifax inc v 
austin ventures viii  lp  et al  equifax filed suit in the lp district court for the southern district of florida to preserve its claims against the shareholder sellers of naviant pending the arbitration proceeding described above 
we are involved in other lawsuits  claims and proceedings as is normal in the ordinary course of our business 
any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position  either individually or in the aggregate 
however  our evaluation of the likely impact of these pending lawsuits could change in the future 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and can be estimated  we accrue a liability for estimated settlements and incurred but unpaid legal fees for services performed to date 
in our opinion  the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations
