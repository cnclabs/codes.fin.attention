management recruiters international mri mri is a franchisor providing support services to its franchisees who engage in the search and recruitment of primarily management and sales personnel for employment by the franchisees customers 
the mri franchisees provide permanent placement services primarily under the mri brand umbrella name 
in addition  mri provides temporary staffing services to its franchisees as support to the franchisees network 
as of december   mri had approximately franchised offices in the united states and approximately franchised offices located in other countries throughout the world 
in  approximately of mri s total revenue was generated outside the united states 
services support for mri s franchise network is provided by administrative offices in new castle  delaware  philadelphia  pennsylvania  cleveland  ohio  and in the united kingdom for international franchise operations 
the broad geographic scope of operations and underlying support and related systems enables franchisees to provide international recruiting and matching of employers with job candidates 
pricing initial franchise fees and ongoing royalties are the primary component of mri s revenues 
individual franchises and international master franchises may be acquired by qualified candidates both in the united states and internationally 
franchisees located in the united states pay an initial fee approximating  while franchisees located internationally pay an initial fee approximating  ongoing royalty fees are based on a contractual percentage of the franchisee s permanent placement service fees and any other revenue collected 
new franchise agreements generally have a term of years 
in accordance with the franchise agreement  the franchisee is entitled to the use of mri s intellectual property  such as trademarks and trade names  as well as ongoing field service and public relations support  training  and purchasing leverage 
franchisees also have access to mri s extensive performance development curriculum which is designed specifically for the recruitment industry  and an inter office referral network which provides franchisees international recruiting capabilities in fulfilling customer requirements 
mri does not control the business operations of its franchisees 
in addition  in conjunction with mri  franchisees offer temporary staffing services to their customers in the areas of administrative  legal  finance  and other professions 
franchisees are responsible for selling these services to their customers and for recruiting temporary personnel 
mri employs the temporary personnel recruited by the franchised offices  and also bears the responsibility for billing and collection services to customers 
the franchisee receives a portion of the gross profit on the temporary staffing service accounts 
customers markets mri s primary objectives are to sell new franchises  renew existing franchises  and  most importantly  provide superior service  training  and support to its franchisees in a way that enables them to increase their revenues 
new franchisees are brought into the mri network primarily on a referral basis 
the ability of mri s franchisees to compete in the staffing services industry is important to the segment s prospects for growth 
the ability of an individual franchisee to compete and operate successfully may be affected by the location and service quality 
table of contents of its office  the number of permanent placement offices in the area  community reputation  and other general and local economic factors 
the potential negative effect of these conditions on the segment s results of quarterly and annual operations is generally reduced by the diverse geographical locations of its franchisees 
no part of mri s business is dependent on a single franchisee 
other information competition all segments of the company s operations face competition in attracting both clients and high quality specialized employment candidates 
the temporary and permanent placement businesses are very competitive and highly fragmented  with limited barriers to entry into the market 
cdi competes in global  national  regional  and local markets with numerous temporary staffing and permanent placement companies 
in many areas  the local companies are the strongest competitors 
in  some of cdi s largest competitors included kelly services  inc  adecco  sa  spherion corporation  volt information services  inc  and jacobs engineering group  inc competition varies from market to market 
in most areas  no single company has a dominant share of the market 
many customers use more than one staffing services company  however  the practice of using a primary supplier has become increasingly prevalent among the largest customers 
this has led to intense price competition within the staffing and recruitment industry in recent years 
these sole supplier relationships can have a significant impact on the company s revenue and operating profit growth as volume reductions by such customers  whether related to economic factors or otherwise  could have an adverse effect on the company s results in any period 
key factors that influence success in cdi s industries include quality of service  price  and geographic location 
the company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience in and commitment to its industries  its national presence  and its various marketing activities 
safeguards business  disaster and contingency planning cdi has a number of safeguards to protect the company from various system related risks 
given the significant amount of data generated in the company s key processes including recruiting  payroll  and customer invoicing  cdi has established redundant processing capability within the company s primary data center 
this redundancy mitigates the risks related to hardware failure 
additionally  cdi has contracted with a third party provider to restore its primary data center operations in the event of a disruption 
finally  the company maintains site disaster plans for a majority of its operating offices as well as maintaining data back up requirements throughout the company 
employees as of december   cdi had approximately  staff employees 
in addition  there were approximately  employees and workers as billable personnel 
the number of billable employees and workers varies in relation to the number of assignments in progress at any particular time 
risk factors the company s business involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond its control 
the risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 
management believes that the more significant of these risks and uncertainties are as follows economic trends the demand for the company s services  in particular its temporary and managed staffing and permanent placement services  is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the company s customers 
the pace of customer capital spending programs  new product launches  and similar activities has a direct impact on the need for temporary and permanent employees and for project outsourcing 
any variation in the economic condition or employment levels of the united states or any of the foreign countries in which the company does business  or in any specific industry  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
government regulations changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional benefits  licensing  or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce cdi s future earnings 
there can be no assurance that cdi would be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner or in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing 
material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting as of december   the company has identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting 
cdi is committed to  and is actively engaged in  remedying these matters 
see item a controls and procedures  in this form k for further information 
the failure to implement  or delays in implementing  the improvements necessary to remedy the material weakness could adversely affect the ability of the company to report reliable financial information on a timely basis and to comply with the financial reporting requirements under applicable governmental and stock exchange rules 
highly competitive business the staffing services business is highly competitive and fragmented with limited barriers to entry 
cdi competes in global  national  regional  and local markets with numerous temporary 
table of contents staffing and permanent placement engineering and it outsourcing companies 
price competition is significant  and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing 
there has been a significant increase in the number of customers consolidating their staffing services and engineering and it outsourcing purchases with a single provider or with a small number of providers 
the trend to consolidate purchases has in some cases made it more difficult for the company to obtain or retain customers 
the company also faces the risk that certain customers may decide to provide similar services internally 
additionally  pricing pressures have intensified as customers have continued to competitively bid new contracts 
this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future which could limit cdi s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability 
offshore outsourcing markets there is increasing pressure on companies to outsource certain areas of their businesses to low cost offshore outsourcing firms 
many staffing  engineering and it outsourcing companies are now seeking an offshore solution to support their technology and business process functions  and as a result  a significant amount of technology and financial staffing may be replaced by offshore resources 
cdi has established partnering arrangements with offshore companies to provide lower cost options to its customers 
however  offshore solution providers could develop direct relationships with cdi s customers which could result in the company losing significant market share and revenue 
availability of qualified candidates cdi depends upon its ability to attract qualified personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of its customers or to successfully bid for new customer projects 
cdi must continually evaluate its base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs and emerging technologies 
competition for individuals with proven professional or technical skills always exists  and demand for such individuals is expected to remain very strong in the foreseeable future 
there is always uncertainty whether qualified personnel will continue to be available to cdi in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to cdi 
potential liability to employees  customers and subcontractors from time to time  various types of legal claims can be alleged against cdi that arise in connection with the ordinary course of its business 
employees of the company may make a variety of claims including workplace injury claims and employment related claims such as discrimination  harassment  and wage and hour claims 
since the company s staffing business involves employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing them in customer workplaces where cdi has limited ability to control the workplace environment  these types of claims may arise more frequently in those business operations 
customers of the company may make claims based on the company s alleged failure to perform in accordance with contract requirements 
since the company s project business often involves responsibility to produce specified deliverables  these types of claims may arise more frequently in those business operations 
customers in the staffing business may allege claims based on the conduct of staffing employees assigned to the customer s worksite 
customers and subcontractors may make claims alleging the company s failure to abide by certain contract provisions 
fixed price contracts cdi  within its bs segment  enters into fixed price contracts with customers  largely for engineering project services 
revenue recognized under fixed price contracts accounts for less than of consolidated revenue over the past three years 
under these fixed price contracts  prices are established based on cost and scheduling estimates  which in turn are based in part on assumptions about the prices and availability of skilled personnel  equipment  and materials 
if the company s price estimates for a particular project prove to be inaccurate  then cost overruns may occur  and cdi could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project 
cost overruns may also be caused by changes in the scope of the project after the contract has been entered into or by a failure of the parties to adequately define and agree upon the entire scope of the project upfront 
in those cases  there may be disputes between the parties over who should pay for the cost overruns 
in general  fixed price contracts can offer greater profit potential but also entail more inherent risk both in terms of possible financial losses and the potential for significant disputes with customers than contracts containing pricing on a time and materials basis 
workers compensation the company self insures a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers compensation 
the company has established reserves for workers compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic independent actuarial valuations 
while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s future financial results 
dependence upon personnel the company s operations depend on the continued efforts of its officers and executive management 
the loss of key officers and members of executive management may cause a significant disruption to the company s business 
cdi also depends on the performance and productivity of its local managers and field personnel 
the company s ability to attract and retain new business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered 
the loss of key managers and field personnel may also jeopardize existing client relationships  which could cause future revenues to decline in that event 
concentration of stock ownership certain members of cdi s directors  and trusts for which some of the company s directors serve as trustee  own  in the aggregate  a substantial portion of the company s outstanding common stock 
by virtue of this stock ownership  such share 
table of contents holders have the power to significantly influence cdi s affairs and are able to influence the outcome of matters required to be submitted to shareholders for approval  including the election of members of any board of directors and the amendment of the company s articles of incorporation or bylaws 
such shareholders could exercise influence over the company in a manner detrimental to the interests of cdi s other shareholders 
foreign currency fluctuations the company is exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates 
cdi s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relates primarily to operations in foreign countries conducted through subsidiaries  principally in the united kingdom and canada 
exchange rate fluctuations impact the us dollar value of reported earnings derived from these foreign operations as well as the carrying value of cdi s investment in the net assets related to these operations 
from time to time  the company engages in hedging activities with respect to its foreign operations 
historically  the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations have been immaterial on cdi s consolidated earnings 
acquisitions the company may selectively pursue acquisitions as an element of its growth strategy 
acquisitions involve a number of risks  including the diversion of management s attention from its existing operations  the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business  the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business  and the inability to successfully integrate the business 
there can be no assurance that any future acquired businesses will generate anticipated revenues or earnings 
data center capacity and telecommunication links the company s ability to protect its data centers against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  and other disasters is critical 
in order to provide many of its services  cdi must be able to store  retrieve  process  and manage large databases and periodically expand and upgrade its capabilities 
any damage to the company s data centers or any failure of the company s telecommunication links that interrupts its operations or results in an inadvertent loss of data could adversely affect cdi s ability to meet its customers needs and their confidence in utilizing cdi for future services

table of contents as part of the company s restructuring and reorganization efforts  some of the company s offices accommodate more than one operating segment 
in such cases  square foot usage is allocated among the segments primarily based on utilization 
each reporting segment has numerous active facilities and locations under operating lease agreements 
most of the leased space is devoted to sales  marketing and administrative functions  in house services  and back office functions

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview despite the improvement in economic conditions in both the united states and abroad  as well as the implementation of the company s new go to market strategy  cdi s revenues declined slightly from this was due primarily to a number of factors  including slower then anticipated ramp up of significant new contracts and continued weak capital spending by clients in key business verticals  particularly within the business solutions bs segment 
additionally  the company incurred higher costs related to incremental hiring of revenue generating personnel at its todays staffing todays and anderselite anders segments as a result of higher than normal turnover in both the management and recruitment functions and the inherent delay before newly hired sales staff generate revenue
