overview we commenced operations in and currently develop  market and support software technologies that enable mobile operators and phone manufacturers to update the firmware of mobile devices using standard over the air data networks 
before  our principal product line was the jeode platform  based on our embedded virtual machine evm technology 
the jeode platform was our implementation of sun microsystems  inc s sun java technology tailored for smart devices 
during  we began development of a range of products secure system provisioning or ssp products for the mobile phone and wireless operator industry 
these ssp products build on our position as a virtual machine vm supplier for manufacturers of mobile devices and allow wireless operators and phone manufacturers to reduce customer care and software recall costs as well as increase subscriber revenue by deploying new mobile services based on dynamically provisional capabilities 
with the sale of our jvm product line in april  our sole product line consists of our ssp product 
we shipped our first ssp product in december  but have achieved only minimal sales to date 
international our operations outside of the united states are primarily in the united kingdom  where part of our research and development operations and our european sales activities are located 
we sell our ssp platform directly to customers or through our hosted partners such as metrowerks and accord customer care solutions 
sales to customers outside the united states were derived mainly from customers in europe and asia  and represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
economic conditions in europe and japan  as well as fluctuations in the value of the euro and japanese yen against the us dollar and british pound sterling  could impair our revenue and results of operations 
our revenues from customers outside the united states are generally affected by the same factors as our revenues from sales to customers in the united states 
the operating expenses of our operations outside the united states are mostly incurred in europe and relate to our research and development and european sales activities 
such expenses consist primarily of ongoing fixed costs and consequently do not fluctuate in direct proportion to revenues 
in  approximately of our total revenues and over of our operating expenses were denominated in us dollars 
most of our remaining expenses are british pound sterling denominated and  consequently  we are exposed to fluctuations in british pound sterling exchange rates 
our expenses outside the united states can fluctuate from period to period based on movements in currency exchange rates 
historically  movements in currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our revenues 
we did not enter into any currency option hedge contracts in  or we operate with the us dollar as our functional currency  with a majority of revenues and operating expenses denominated in us dollars 
pound sterling exchange rate fluctuations against the dollar can cause uk expenses  which are translated into dollars for financial statement reporting purposes  to vary from period to period 

table of contents significant financial events in in early january  insignia solutions issued and sold to certain institutional and other accredited investors  in a private placement   newly issued american depository shares adss  and warrants to purchase  adss  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
on june   insignia and esmertec  a swiss software company focused on java technologies  entered into a termination and waiver agreement  effectively concluding the remaining business between the two companies and dissolving any ties going forward between insignia and the java virtual machine jvm product line it sold to esmertec in april as a result  esmertec agreed to pay insignia  on july  in full and final satisfaction of the deferred consideration and waived all other consideration pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated march  the new agreement accelerated the termination under the asset purchase agreement from march to june  all existing and future outstanding obligations between the two companies were waived resulting in net other income of  to insignia 
on october   insignia announced that it had closed two equity financing transactions totaling approximately million  net of transaction costs 
we closed a private placement financing with certain institutional and other accredited investors pursuant to which we sold newly issued adss and warrants to purchase adss  for a total purchase price of approximately million  or million net of transaction costs 
additionally  under a previously executed securities subscription agreement  we sold to fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital  shares of newly issued adss at a purchase price of per share  resulting in proceeds of approximately million  net of transaction costs 
in addition during the fourth quarter of  we issued additional shares under the october  securities subscription agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc at a rate of  per day 
we issued an additional  shares and received an additional  at december    was due from fusion capital for stock purchases made and the amount is included in other receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in item of this form k 
payment was received in january critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of prepaid royalties  and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition and statement of position no 
 modification of sop no these statements of position require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or 
table of contents determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue on the earlier of due date or the date on which cash is collected 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we will defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  we use either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order primarily for maintenance renewals as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we will allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we will defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair value for the ongoing maintenance and support obligation is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us for these services to other customers 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we will generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  we will assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
prepaid royalties our agreements with licensors sometimes require us to make advance royalty payments and pay royalties based on product sales 
prepaid royalties are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales based on the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales 
we continually evaluate recoverability of prepaid royalties and  if necessary  will charge to cost of sales any amount that we deem unlikely to be recoverable in the future 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and will adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  credit loss rates may increase 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivables and future operating results 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer 
table of contents concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset 
based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
sale of java virtual machine assets on february   we entered into a loan agreement with esmertec whereby esmertec loaned insignia million at an interest rate of prime plus two percent 
the principal amount of million was repaid on january  by offsetting that amount with a receivable relating to the product line purchase 
all remaining accrued interest of  was repaid on march  by offsetting the accrued interest against prepaid royalties 
accordingly  there are no outstanding balances or future amounts due to esmertec under the loan agreement as of december  on march   we entered into several other agreements the agreements with esmertec  including a definitive agreement to sell certain assets relating to our jvm product line in exchange for million due in installments through april the transaction closed on april  and was amended on june  the assets sold primarily included the fixed assets  customer agreements and employees related to the jvm product line

additionally  the parties entered into a cooperative agreement whereas esmertec would promote insignia s secure system provisioning ssp software product to esmertec s mobile platform customers 
as part of the sale of our jvm product line  we transferred employees to esmertec  of which were development engineers 
in addition  as part of the sale  esmertec entered into an agreement with our uk building landlord in order to assume the lease on one of the two buildings leased by insignia 
on february   insignia and esmertec executed the final purchase agreement upon signing the limited assignment of rights of technology license and distribution agreement 
the final purchase agreement transferred the intellectual property of jeode and the title for insignia s remaining prepaid royalties to esmertec 
on june   insignia and esmertec executed a termination and waiver agreement 
the agreement offset esmertec related liabilities and deferred revenue totaling  against  of remaining guaranteed royalty payments due from esmertec in exchange for final cash payment of  the resulting net gain of  was recorded as other income in the second quarter of and is net of expenses 
the final payment was received from esmertec on july  the jeode platform had been our principal product line since the third quarter of with the completion of the sale of our jvm product line to esmertec in february  insignia s sole product line currently consists of its ssp products for the mobile handset and wireless carrier industry

the cost of license revenue for and was mainly comprised of royalties to third parties on sales of our jeode product line 
in all three years the cost of service revenue was a result of costs associated with non recurring engineering activities and end user support under maintenance contracts 
the gross margin on sales of our ssp platform is typically affected by whether we are using internal or external representatives to sell the ssp product line and the percentage commission negotiated with the sales people or companies selling the ssp software 
we believe that the significant factors affecting the jeode platform gross margin in and included pricing of the technology license  the unit usage and royalties to third parties  in particular sun microsystems 
license revenue gross margins in were compared to in the increase in gross margin was due to lower sales of our jeode product in  and hence lower royalties paid to sun  as a result of our sale of the jeode business to esmertec in april license revenue gross margins in were compared to in the decrease was due to lower margins on revenue due to the sale of the jeode product line to esmertec ag gross margin for services revenue is impacted by the level of and pricing terms of non recurring engineering activities  which can vary from customer to customer  from contract to contract and based on the level of maintenance contracts sold

allocated overhead costs also decreased by  due to the resulting headcount decrease 
in addition  marketing programs and public relations costs decreased by  as a result of cost cutting measures 
these costs decreases were offset by a  increase in costs for the french sales office and a  increase in costs to an outside sales firm targeting the asian markets

we have granted extended payment terms to customers from time to time depending on various factors  including the length of the requested payment extension and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we report these future payments as accounts receivable and either recognized revenue or deferred revenue 
deferred revenue decreased by  for the decrease was primarily the result of assigning our jeode support and maintenance contracts to esmertec in early insignia warrants its software products against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of ninety days 
there is no warranty accrual recorded because potential future payments either are not probable or we have yet to incur the expense 
on october   we entered into a securities subscription agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital  pursuant to which fusion capital agreed to purchase  on each trading day following the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the american depository shares adss to be purchased by fusion capital   of our adss up to an aggregate of million over a period of months

insignia intends to file as soon as practicable and within days of fusion capital s request a registration statement on form s in order to register the resale of these shares 
on february   insignia and fusion capital entered into a mutual termination agreement pursuant to which the fusion capital securities subscription agreement was terminated 
as a result of this termination  the  shares issued on exercise of the warrants described above may be resold by fusion capital under the company s existing s registration statement 
on february   insignia entered into a new securities subscription agreement with fusion capital to sell up to million in adss  representing ordinary shares  to fusion capital over a period of months subject to daily maximum purchase amounts the fusion capital securities subscription agreement 
the shares will be priced based on a market based formula at the time of purchase 
the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement is subject to certain conditions  including the declaration of effectiveness by the securities and exchange commission of a registration statement covering the adss to be purchased by fusion capital under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement 
under the rules and regulations of the nasdaq smallcap market  the company would be required to obtain shareholder approval to sell more than of the issued and outstanding shares as of february  under this agreement 
insignia currently expects that commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement will begin during the second quarter of  however the timing and certainty of the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement are not within insignia s control 
any delay in the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement could jeopardize our business

these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
based upon our current forecasts and estimates  including the timely closing of the fusion capital securities subscription agreement and the achievement of our target revenues  cost cutting and accounts receivable collection goals  our current forecasted cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through december  if cash currently available from all sources is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek additional sources of financing  including selling additional equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our shares  and the terms of such securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when needed and on acceptable terms our business may be jeopardized

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf in september which delayed the effective date of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in april  the eitf issued statement no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share eitf 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on insignia s results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs sfas 
sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overhead costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities and unallocated overhead costs recognized as an expense in the period incurred 
in addition  other items such as abnormal freight  handling costs and wasted materials require treatment as current period charges rather than a portion of the inventory cost 
sfas is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires measurement of all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas r is effective beginning in our third quarter of fiscal we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in stock based compensation charges that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in our first quarter of fiscal we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects we may need additional financing to sustain our operations  and we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of million at december  we had recurring net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  and we also had net cash used in operations of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled million at december   compared to million at december  based upon our current forecasts and estimates  including the timely closing of the fusion capital securities subscription agreement and the achievement of our target revenues  cost cutting and accounts receivable collection goals  our current forecasted cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through december  if cash currently available from all sources is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek additional sources of financing including selling additional equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our shares  and the terms of such securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when needed and on acceptable terms our business may be jeopardized 
pursuant to the fusion capital agreement  insignia sold to fusion capital  adss at a purchase price of per share  resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
these shares were issued to fusion capital in a private placement  and the shares are not resaleable under the company s existing form s registration statement 
insignia intends to file as soon as practicable and within days of fusion capital s request a registration statement on form s in order to register the resale of these shares 
on february   insignia and fusion capital entered into a mutual termination agreement pursuant to which the fusion capital securities subscription agreement was terminated 
as a result of this termination the  shares issued on exercise of the warrants may be resold by fusion capital under the company s existing s registration statement 
on february   insignia entered into a new securities subscription agreement with fusion capital to sell up to million in adss  representing ordinary shares  to fusion capital over a period of months the fusion capital securities subscription agreement 
the shares will be priced based on a market based formula at the time of purchase 
the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement is subject to certain conditions  including the declaration of effectiveness by the securities and exchange commission of a registration statement covering the adss to be purchased by fusion capital under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement 
under the rules and regulations of the nasdaq smallcap market  the company would be required to obtain shareholder approval to sell more than of the issued and outstanding shares as of february  under this agreement 
insignia currently expects that commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement will begin during the second quarter of  however the timing and certainty of the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement are not within insignia s control 
any delay in the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement could jeopardize our business 

table of contents our stock could be delisted from nasdaq 
insignia s shareholders equity at december  was  which was below the minimum  in shareholders equity required for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the company believes that its recent financing of  with fusion capital announced on february  should raise its shareholders equity above the minimum required by nasdaq 
we also announced on february  that we have entered into a new million securities subscription agreement with fusion capital llc

any delay in the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement could jeopardize our business 
the sale of our shares to fusion capital may cause dilution  and the sale of the shares by fusion capital could cause the price of our shares to decline 
the subscription price for the shares to be issued to fusion capital pursuant to the securities subscription agreement with fusion capital will fluctuate based on the price of our shares 
shares sold to fusion capital under the securities subscription agreement will be freely tradable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares purchased from us at any time 
we expect that the shares to be sold to fusion capital will be sold over a period of up to months from the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with the transaction 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of such shares at any given time could cause the trading price of our shares to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares  or anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
we have achieved minimal sales of our ssp product line to date 
our future performance depends upon sales of products of our ssp product line  which is our sole product line 
we only began shipping the ssp product in december and have achieved only minimal sales to date  including revenues of only  relating to sales of the ssp product in if we are unable to gain the necessary customer traction for our ssp product  our business may be jeopardized 
our ssp product represents the next generation of products that enable carriers to repair and update mobile phones over the air without having their customers send back their handsets to the carrier for repair or update 
to the extent that carriers continue to use the current generation of over the air products  such as those offered by bitfone  innopath  openwave and mformation  to make repairs and updates and do not believe that the next generation products  such as our ssp product  offer a sufficiently important improvement at a reasonable cost  then we may not achieve our targeted sales and our business could fail 
in addition  some prospective customers have been reticent to buy our ssp product because of our current financial position 
while we believe that upon the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement  we will have an adequate funding source through  to the extent that prospective customers believe that we are under capitalized  they may be hesitant to buy our ssp product 
in addition  the commencement of funding under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement is subject to conditions  the timing and certainty of which are not within our control 

table of contents the long and complex process of licensing our ssp product makes our revenue unpredictable 
our revenue is dependent upon our ability to license our ssp product to third parties 
licensing our ssp product has to date been a long and complex process  longer than the typical six to nine months sales cycle for our former product 
before committing to license our products  potential customers must generally consider a wide range of issues including product benefits  infrastructure requirements  functionality  reliability and our ability to work with existing systems 
the process of entering into a development license with a company typically involves lengthy negotiations 
because of the sales cycle  it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  a particular prospect might sign a license agreement 
development license fees may be delayed or reduced because of this process 
we only began shipping the ssp product in december and have achieved only minimal sales to date 
we rely on third parties for software development tools  which we distribute with some of our products 
we license software development tool products from other companies to distribute with some of our products 
these third parties may not be able to provide competitive products with adequate features and high quality on a timely basis or to provide sales and marketing cooperation 
furthermore  our products compete with products produced by some of our licensors 
when these licenses terminate or expire  continued license rights might not be available to us on reasonable terms  or at all 
we might not be able to obtain similar products to substitute into our tool suites 
if handset manufacturers and other third parties do not achieve substantial sales of their products that incorporate our ssp technology  we will not receive royalty payments on our licenses 
our success depends upon the use of our technology by our licensees in their smart devices 
our licensees undertake a lengthy process of developing systems that use our technology 
until a licensee has sales of its systems incorporating our technology  they will not pay commercial use royalties to us 
we expect that the period of time between entering into a development license and actually recognizing commercial use royalties will be lengthy and difficult to predict 
we have a history of losses and we must generate significantly greater revenue if we are to achieve profitability 
we have experienced operating losses in each quarter since the second quarter of to achieve profitability  we will have to increase our revenue significantly 
our ability to increase revenue depends upon the success of our ssp product line  and to date we have received only minimal revenue 
if we are unable to create revenue from ssp in the form of development license fees  maintenance and support fees  commercial use royalties and nonrecurring engineering services  our current revenue will be insufficient to sustain our business 
we need to increase our sales and marketing expenditures in order to achieve sales of our ssp product  however  this increase in expenses is expected to decrease our cash position 
in and  we spent and  respectively  of our total revenue on sales and marketing 
we expect to continue to incur disproportionately high sales and marketing expenses in the future 
to market ssp effectively  we must develop client and server channel markets 
we will continue to incur the expenses for a sales and marketing infrastructure before we recognize significant revenue from sales of the product 
because customers in the smart device market tend to remain with the same vendor over time  we believe that we must devote significant resources to each potential sale 
if potential customers do not design our products into their systems  the resources we have devoted to the sales prospect would be lost 
if we fail to achieve and sustain significant increases in our quarterly sales  we may not be able to continue to increase our investment in these areas 
with increased expenses  we must significantly increase our revenue if we are to become profitable 

table of contents our business strategy is focused on our sole product line  the ssp product line 
we face significant risks associated with the development and future deployment of our ssp product and the successful execution of the related business strategy 
with the sale of the jeode product line to esmertec  ssp is our sole product line 
we only began shipping the ssp product in december and have achieved only minimal sales to date 
if we are unable to stay abreast of technological changes  evolving industry standards and rapidly changing customer requirements  our business reputation will likely suffer and revenue may decline 
the market for mobile devices is fragmented and characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements 
ssp will need to be continually improved to meet emerging market conditions  such as new interoperability standards  new methods of wireless notifications  new flash silicon technologies and new telecom infrastructure elements 
our existing products will become less competitive or obsolete if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that anticipate the features and functionality that customers demand 
the success of our new product introductions will depend on our ability to accurately anticipate industry trends and changes in technology standards  complete and introduce new product designs and features in a timely manner  continue to enhance our existing product lines  and respond promptly to customers requirements and preferences 
development delays are commonplace in the software industry 
we have experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products in the past and are likely to experience delays in the future 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis or at all  competitive products  product enhancements and new products that respond to technological change  changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
our targeted market is highly competitive 
our ssp product line is targeted for the mobile operator and mobile device market 
the market for these products is fragmented and highly competitive 
this market is also rapidly changing  and there are many companies creating products that compete or will compete with ours 
as the industry develops  we expect competition to increase in the future 
this competition may come from existing competitors or other companies that we do not yet know about 
our main competitors include bitfone  innopath  thpass  openwave and redbend 
if these competitors develop products that are less expensive or provide better capabilities or functionality than does our ssp product line  we will be unable to gain market share 
many of our current competitors and potential competitors have greater resources  including larger customer bases and greater financial resources than we do  and we might not be able to compete successfully against these companies 
a variety of other potential actions by our competitors  including increased promotion and accelerated introduction of new or enhanced products  could also harm our competitive position 
our revenue model may not succeed 
competition could force us to reduce the prices of our products  which would result in reduced gross margins and could harm our ability to provide adequate service to our customers and our business 
our pricing model for our software products is a combination of initial license fees  activated subscriber fees  support and maintenance fees  and currently engineering service fees  any of which may be subject to significant pricing pressures 
also  the market may demand alternative pricing models in the future  which could decrease our revenues and gross margins 

table of contents fluctuations in our quarterly results could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  the mix of and changes in customers to whom our products are sold  the mix of product and service revenue received during the quarter  the mix of development license fees and commercial use royalties received  the timing and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us or by our competitors  changes in product pricing  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and ability to recognize revenue on orders received 
all of these factors are difficult to forecast 
our future operating results may fluctuate due to these and other factors  including our ability to continue to develop innovative and competitive products 
due to all of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be viewed as an indication of our future performance 
we have engineering and other operations both in the united states and foreign countries  which is expensive and can create logistical challenges 
we currently have employees in the united states and employees in the united kingdom 
in the past  the geographic distance between our engineering personnel in the united kingdom and our principal offices in california and primary markets in asia  europe and the united states has led to logistical and communication difficulties 
in the future  we may experience similar difficulties  which may have an adverse impact on our business 
further  because a substantial portion of our research and development operations is located in the united kingdom  our operations and expenses are directly affected by economic and political conditions in the united kingdom 
economic conditions in europe and fluctuations in the value of the euro against the us dollar and british pound sterling could impair our revenue and results of operations 
international operations are subject to a number of other special risks 
these risks include foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where we do business  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
in march  we acquired mie device management  ab  a scandinavian company headquartered in sweden 
we now have approximately employees and an office in sweden 
it takes substantial management time and financial resources to integrate operations in connection with an acquisition  and the potential logistical  personnel and customer challenges are exacerbated when  as in this case  the acquirer and target companies are separated by great geographic distance 
international sales of our products  which we expect to comprise a significant portion of total revenue  expose us to the business and economic risks of international operations 
sales from outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for and  respectively 
we expect to market ssp to mobile operators and handset manufacturers in europe 
economic conditions in europe and fluctuations in the value of the euro against the us dollar and 
table of contents british pound sterling in particular could impair our revenue and results of operations 
international operations are subject to a number of other risks 
these risks include longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where we do business  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  terrorism  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
product defects can be expensive to fix and may cause us to lose customers 
our software products  like all software products  may have undetected errors or compatibility problems 
software errors are particularly common when a product is first introduced or a new version is released 
despite thorough testing  our products might be shipped with errors 
if this were to happen  customers could reject our products  or there might be costly delays in correcting the problems 
our products are increasingly used in systems that interact directly with the general public  such as in transportation and medical systems 
in these public facing systems  the failure of our product could cause substantial property damage or personal injury  which could expose us to product liability claims 
our products are used for applications in business systems where the failure of our product could be linked to substantial economic loss 
our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability and other claims 
it is likely  however  that these provisions are not effective in all circumstances and in all jurisdictions 
we may not have adequate insurance against product liability risks  and renewal of our insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
further  our errors and omissions insurance may not be adequate to cover claims 
if we ever had to recall our product due to errors or other problems  it would cost us a great deal of time  effort and expense 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases against damage by fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events 
the measures we have taken to reduce the risk of interruption in our operations may not be sufficient 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced any major interruptions in our operations because of a catastrophic event 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or sell our products 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and operations personnel 
we do not have agreements with any of our key personnel that require them to work for us for a specific term  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we currently intend to hire additional salespeople and believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and operations personnel  many of whom are in great demand 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense in the san francisco bay area  where our us operations are headquartered 

table of contents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors could introduce similar or superior products  and we could lose market share 
we depend on our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use information that we consider proprietary 
our competitors could independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which software piracy of our products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
the status of us patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the united states patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
patents have been granted on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued that relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into our products 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may result in lawsuits and prevent us from selling our products 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases  products based on our technology may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims 
third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future 
infringement claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims  whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
if there is an adverse ruling against us in any litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology 
our failure to develop or license a substitute technology could prevent us from selling our products 
we are at risk of securities litigation which  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
stock market volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by us and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against high technology companies 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  the target of similar litigation 
regardless of the outcome  securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
our investors may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us in us courts because many of our assets and some of our management are located in england 
insignia is incorporated under the laws of england and wales 
two of our directors reside in england 
all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons  and a portion of our assets  are located outside of the united states 
it may not be possible for investors to serve a complaint within the united states upon these persons or to enforce against them or against us  in us courts  judgments obtained in us courts based upon the civil liability provisions of us securities laws 
there is doubt about the enforceability outside of the united states  in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts  of civil liabilities based solely upon us securities laws 
the rights of holders of our shares are governed by english law  including the companies act  and by our memorandum and articles of association 
the rights of holders of our adss are also affected by english law 
these rights differ from the rights of security holders in typical us corporations 

table of contents insignia has undergone a class action lawsuit and an sec investigation in the past eight years 
on april   a class action lawsuit was filed against us alleging that we misrepresented our business  the strength of our sales force and our financial health 
the suit stemmed from our failure to achieve the consensus earnings estimates of research analysts in the first quarter following our initial public offering in november in august  we reached a memorandum of understanding to settle the suits 
although we never agreed with the allegations  we paid million to the plaintiffs  of which our insurance company paid million 
in february  we restated our financial results for the quarters ended march and june  we revised our revenue and net income numbers downward for these two quarters due to inflated revenue resulting from misstatement of inventory levels of one of our resellers by two of our sales and marketing personnel 
we agreed with the sec to cease and desist from engaging in similar accounting practices 
the two insignia sales and marketing people involved in the revenue misstatement are no longer with insignia and were forced to pay significant fines 
we did not have to pay any fines 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had  in cash held in foreign currencies as translated at period end foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our foreign currencies are british pound sterling and are primarily used for paying the local operating expenses of our uk office 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operations resulted in income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  we did not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
we have  at times  an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities
