item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of selected factors  including those set forth under risks related to our business in item all forward looking statements included herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix  inc  based in minneapolis  develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive medical products for the treatment of urological disorders 
we have developed and offer non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of bph  a disease that dramatically affects more than million men worldwide by causing adverse changes in urinary voiding patterns 
we market our products under the targis and prostatron names 
both systems utilize cooled thermotherapy  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without anesthesia or intravenous sedation and  as a result  can be performed in a physician s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph that is clinically superior to medication and is without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the adoption of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy is key to obtaining this reimbursement 
we estimate that to of patients who receive treatment in the united states will be eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market adoption of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
the level of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
beginning on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms replaced the reasonable cost basis of reimbursement for outpatient hospital based procedures  including cooled thermotherapy  with a new fixed rate or prospective payment system 
under this method of reimbursement  a hospital receives a fixed reimbursement for each cooled thermotherapy treatment performed in its facility  approximately  in calendar year  although the rate varies depending on a wage index and other factors for each hospital 
the urologist performing the cooled thermotherapy treatment receives reimbursement of approximately per procedure 
in january  cms began to reimburse for cooled thermotherapy treatments performed in the urologist s office 
the reimbursement rate inclusive of the physician s fee in calendar year for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office is approximately  compared to  in calendar  which is subject to geographic adjustment 
reimbursement rates for calendar year will be published in the november edition of the federal register 
in july  cms added the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy to the asc list of medicare approved procedures providing a reimbursement rate for ambulatory surgical centers asc 
as a result  procedures performed in an asc were reimbursed under a two part system similar to hospitals the asc received 
table of contents a fixed fee of approximately  the highest amount allowable under this system  while the urologist performing the procedure was reimbursed the same amount as if the treatment occurred in a hospital  approximately the relatively low facility reimbursement relative to the cost of the procedure potentially limited the number of cooled thermotherapy treatments done in an asc 
effective july  the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy was deleted from the asc list of medicare approved procedures 
as a result  effective with that change  urologists who perform cooled thermotherapy procedures in an asc are reimbursed at the office based reimbursement rates  approximately  inclusive of the physician s fee in calendar year  subject to geographic adjustment 
our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is i educate both patients and physicians on the benefits of cooled thermotherapy compared to other treatment options  ii increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by physicians who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system  iii increase the number of physicians who provide cooled thermotherapy to their patients  and iv satisfy demand for cooled thermotherapy systems through the efficient use of both new systems and systems already in use 
we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing programs and research and development projects as we focus on growing our revenues  continue clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  and continue improving our therapy 
our future profitability will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving increased treatment volume and market adoption of the cooled thermotherapy procedures in the physician s office  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the extent to which medicare and other health care payers continue to reimburse costs of cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in physicians offices  hospitals  and ambulatory surgery centers and the amount of reimbursement provided 
critical accounting policies in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy system control units upon delivery to the customer 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy system control units with customers under a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use 
we retain title to these control units and do not recognize any revenue on these control units until title has transferred 
these programs are designed to expand access to our technology  and thus expand the market for our single use treatment catheters 
revenue from the sale of single use treatment catheters is recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue for warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents product warranty we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim and other factors 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories and related allowance for excess and obsolete inventory we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  single use treatment catheters  and raw materials to produce the control units and treatment catheters  at the lower of cost or market value on the first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill at june   the net carrying value of goodwill was million 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the impairment test are considered critical  due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
as of june  other intangible assets consist of developed technologies  customer base and trademarks of million  million and million  respectively 
developed technologies and customer base are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
the trademark asset is considered to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  and it will not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
we review intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make the determination 
we continue to assess the need for a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
we consider factors such as having a cumulative pretax loss of million in the past three fiscal years 
the valuation allowance at june  was million 
we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales growth resulted primarily from increased revenues from the sale of our single use treatment catheters in the united states partially offset by a decrease in the number of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold during the period as well as lower revenues internationally 
sales of single use treatment catheters accounted for of revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal average per unit selling prices of our single use treatment catheters increased over fiscal prices primarily due to our price standardization initiative implemented in the second half of fiscal as well as a stronger mix of sales to our direct office accounts 
we expect demand for our treatment catheters to increase in fiscal over fiscal as we continue to focus on increasing the utilization rates of our existing customers while continuing to develop new direct accounts and re invigorate the mobile channel 
at june   we had a domestic installed base of cooled thermotherapy systems  including the units that are being used by customers pursuant to our evaluation and long term use programs  compared to an installed base of units at june  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  and amortization expense related to developed technologies 
effective july   we began including amortization expense related to developed technologies within cost of goods sold 
this expense was previously reported within amortization of other intangible assets 
consistent with the change  we re classified  of amortization expense to cost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended june  cost of goods sold for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in the number of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold during the year  combined with lower per unit manufacturing costs of our single use treatment catheters  as well as a  charge we incurred in fiscal related to a commitment to purchase additional control unit inventory at prices which exceeded the expected future sales value 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the gross profit rate resulted primarily from an increase in the average per unit selling prices of our single use treatment catheters combined with a reduction in their average per unit manufacturing costs 
additionally  fiscal gross profit rates were negatively impacted by the  charge described above 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in expense is due primarily to a reduction in legal expenses related to the patent infringement suit we filed to protect our intellectual property that was settled in january  as well as a reduction in corporate overhead and variable selling expenses  partially offset by an increase in expenses related to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal to increase as we continue to invest in sales and marketing programs and resources designed to generate awareness and further acceptance of cooled thermotherapy with both physicians and patients 
research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 

table of contents the increase in expenses resulted primarily from increased expenditures on product development activities related to our next generation coolwave control unit partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses 
we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in fiscal as we invest in development programs and clinical research aimed at further improving our technology and treatment outcomes 
amortization of other intangible assets effective july   we began including amortization expense related to the developed technologies acquired from edap within cost of goods sold 
consistent with this change  we re classified  from amortization of intangibles to costs of goods sold for the fiscal year ended june  amortization of other intangible assets was  for both fiscal and this amortization expense is related to the acquired customer base that resulted from the purchase of the prostatron cooled thermotherapy product line from edap in october restructuring in may  we announced plans for organizational restructuring that eliminated positions within the company and also resulted in our vacating a portion of our leased facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge to cover the expenses associated with these items 
all of the targeted headcount reductions were completed by june  and we sublet the vacated space beginning in the second quarter of fiscal there were no restructuring charges in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a  restructuring benefit  which resulted from a reduction in our severance obligations related to the may workforce reduction 
all severance obligations have been paid 
the lease term on the vacated space runs through fiscal net interest income net interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is due to higher cash and investment balances  higher interest rates  as well as a reduction in interest expense associated with the lease obligation assumed as part of the prostatron acquisition in october the lease obligation was completed during the third fiscal quarter of provision for income taxes income tax expense increased to  for fiscal from  in the prior year 
the majority of income tax expense represents the increase in the deferred tax liability resulting from the amortization of goodwill and trademarks for tax purposes 
the deferred tax liability related to the indefinite lived intangible assets cannot be offset against deferred tax assets with finite lives 
the increase in income tax expense in fiscal is due to federal alternative minimum taxes and state taxes 
income tax expense is expected to be approximately  in fiscal fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of single use treatment catheters at moderately higher average per unit selling prices  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units 
although the number of control units sold increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal  a decrease in the average per unit sales price of these systems more than offset the increased unit volume 
sales of single use treatment catheters accounted for of revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we believe that our sales and marketing efforts focused on improving office based utilization through physician education on the clinical benefits of cooled thermotherapy combined with the increased medicare reimbursement rate for cooled 
table of contents thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office  which went into effect january   resulted in increased interest and demand for our products in fiscal at june   we had a domestic installed base of cooled thermotherapy systems  including the units that are being used by customers pursuant to our evaluation and long term use programs  compared to an installed base of units at june  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to higher sales volumes of both single use treatment catheters and control units  partially offset by lower per unit manufacturing costs 
additionally  fiscal cost of goods sold included a charge of  for a lower of cost or market write down of control unit inventory and fiscal cost of goods sold included a  charge for a commitment to purchase additional control unit inventory at prices which exceeded the expected future sales value 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the gross profit rate resulted primarily from the increased volume of higher margin single use treatment catheters sold in fiscal year  combined with a modest increase in the average per unit selling prices and a reduction in the average per unit manufacturing cost of single use treatment catheters  partially offset by a decrease in the average per unit selling price of cooled thermotherapy system control units 
additionally  fiscal gross profit rates were negatively impacted by the  charge described above 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in expense is attributable to the organizational restructuring and workforce reduction that occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of  and a reduction in legal expenses related to the patent infringement suit we filed to protect our intellectual property that was settled in january research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in expenses resulted primarily from the organizational restructuring and workforce reduction that occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of  and decreased expenditures on product development activities and clinical trial expenses 
amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets was  for both fiscal and effective july   we began including amortization expense related to the developed technologies acquired from edap within cost of goods sold 
consistent with this change  we re classified  from amortization of intangibles to costs of goods sold for the fiscal years ended june  and restructuring in may  we announced plans for organizational restructuring that eliminated positions within the company and also resulted in our vacating a portion of our leased facility

all severance obligations have been paid 
the lease term on the vacated space runs through fiscal 
table of contents net interest income net interest income for fiscal decreased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was due to lower interest income resulting from lower cash and investment balances  partially offset by lower interest expense 
provision for income taxes income tax expense was  for fiscal and fiscal income tax expense represents the increase in the deferred tax liability resulting from the amortization of goodwill and trademarks for tax purposes 
the deferred tax liability related to the indefinite lived intangible assets cannot be offset against deferred tax assets with finite lives 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million compared million as of june  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments resulted primarily from improvements in operating results in fiscal  as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately  cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
our net earnings of million combined with depreciation and amortization of million were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses and deferred income of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was driven by a number of factors  including higher sales volume in june versus june  and lower fourth quarter cash collections in fiscal due to turnover in collections staff and increased focus of accounting personnel on sarbanes oxley compliance 
the significant decreases in accrued expenses and deferred income resulted primarily from a decrease in accrued compensation expense related to annual employee bonuses earned in fiscal but not paid as of june  increases in accounts payable and decreases in prepaid and other assets of  and  respectively  were partially offset by an increase in inventory of  cash provided by investing activities we generated million from investing activities  resulting from the maturity of million of available for sale investments partially offset by the purchase of  of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal we generated  from financing activities as a result of  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the  principal payment to edap for the retirement of the promissory note associated with the prostratron acquisition 
the final payment on the promissory note was made to edap on december  we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use of our cooled thermotherapy system control units in addition to purchase options 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately million of control units used in evaluation or long term use programs 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance the units used by these customers 

table of contents future contractual commitments  including interest  that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands total building and equipment leases we have no contractual commitments beyond fiscal year based upon our financial performance in fiscal  we believe our million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments at june   together with the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital resources needs for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant

sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  and we adopted this standard on july  using the modified prospective method 
beginning in fiscal year  our results of operations will reflect compensation expense for new stock options granted under our stock incentive plan  and for the unvested portion of previous stock options granted 
while we cannot precisely determine the impact on net earnings as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimate our equity based compensation expense will be between million and million for fiscal year the decrease in the expected expense of million to million in fiscal compared to the pro forma expense of million in fiscal is due primarily to the reduction in unvested options as of the beginning of fiscal versus earlier years and to the final vesting of options granted in fiscal and fiscal with weighted average fair values of and  respectively  compared to the continuing vesting and expense associated with options granted in fiscal and fiscal with lower weighted average fair values of and  respectively 
the ultimate amount of equity based compensation expense will be dependent on the number of option shares granted during the year  as well as the timing  the vesting period  and the determined fair value of the awards  and other factors such as future forfeitures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments 
our financial investment portfolio at june  is carried at market value 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for the issues contained in the available for sale investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward commodity contracts since we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
