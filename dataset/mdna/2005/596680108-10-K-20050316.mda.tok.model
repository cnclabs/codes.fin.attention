the following discussions of the company s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview middlesex water company has operated as a water utility in new jersey since  and in delaware  through our wholly owned subsidiary  tidewater  since we are in the business of collecting  treating  distributing and selling water for domestic  commercial  municipal  industrial and fire protection purposes 
we also operate a new jersey municipal water and wastewater system under contract and provide wastewater services in new jersey and delaware through our subsidiaries 
we are regulated as to rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services in new jersey and for water services in delaware  as to the quality of water service we provide and as to certain other matters 
our tesi subsidiary is expected to commence operations during as a regulated wastewater utility in delaware 
only our usa  usa pa and white marsh subsidiaries are not regulated utilities 
our new jersey water utility system the middlesex system provides water services to approximately  retail customers  primarily in central new jersey 
the middlesex system also provides water service under contract to municipalities in central new jersey with a total population of approximately  in partnership with our subsidiary  usa pa  we operate the water supply system and wastewater system for the city of perth amboy  new jersey 
our other new jersey subsidiaries  pinelands water and pinelands wastewater  provide water and wastewater services to residents in southampton township  new jersey 
our delaware subsidiaries  tidewater and southern shores  provide water services to approximately  retail customers in new castle  kent and sussex counties  delaware 
our other delaware subsidiary  white marsh  services an additional  customers in kent and sussex counties 
the majority of our revenue is generated from retail and contract water services to customers in our service areas 
we record water service revenue as such service is rendered and include estimates for amounts unbilled at the end of the period for services provided after the last billing cycle 
fixed service charges are billed in advance by our subsidiary  tidewater  and are recognized in revenue as the service is provided 
our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on three factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  and customer growth 
these factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years 
results of operations in compared to operating revenues for the year rose million  or over the same period in water sales improved by million in our middlesex system  which was primarily a result of base rate increases 
customer growth of in delaware provided additional consumption revenues of million and higher base rates provided million 
our meter services venture provided million of additional revenues for completed meter installations 
new unregulated wastewater contracts in delaware provided million in additional revenues 
base rate increases for our pinelands system contributed million of additional revenues 
revenues from our operations and maintenance contracts decreased million due to scheduled reductions in fixed fees under the city of perth amboy contract 
while we anticipate continued growth in the number of customers and increased water consumption among our delaware systems  such growth and increased consumption cannot be guaranteed 
weather conditions may adversely impact future consumption even with an anticipated growth in the number of customers 
our new jersey systems are also highly dependent on the effects of weather 
our ability to generate operating revenues by our meter services venture is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional contracts  however usa did not submit bids for any meter service contracts during fiscal and currently does not expect to submit any bids during fiscal the existing meter services contracts were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of operating expenses increased by million  or as compared to the same period in operation and maintenance expenses increased million or 
in new jersey  payroll costs  employee benefits and corporate governance related fees increased costs by million 
source of supply and pumping costs for the middlesex system increased by million combined due to increased costs for electricity and purchased water 
costs to operate the tidewater system  as well as an increase in our delaware employee base  general wage increases and higher costs associated with employee medical and retirement benefits increased costs by million 
the costs of our meter services venture increased million due to completed installations 
the costs of our non regulated wastewater operations and maintenance contracts increased million due to additional contracts obtained during the year 
these increases were partially offset by million of reduced costs related to our city of perth amboy contract due to reduced water treatment costs and a decrease of million for water main repair costs in our middlesex system 
going forward we anticipate an increase in new jersey s electric generation costs due to deregulation of electricity 
these increasing costs  in addition to higher business insurance and corporate governance costs  as well as completion of the new raw water pipeline during the second quarter of will require us to file for a base rate increase with the bpu for middlesex during we cannot predict whether the bpu will approve  deny or reduce the amount of any request 
depreciation expense for increased by million  or  due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
allowance for funds used during construction rose by million for the year  due to large construction projects in new jersey for the renew program and a new raw water pipeline see liquidity and capital resources for additional discussion of capital spending 
as our investments in utility plant and operating expenses increase  we continue to seek timely rate relief through base rate filings as discussed above 
other taxes increased by million generally reflecting additional taxes on higher taxable gross revenues  payroll and real estate 
improved operating results in compared to led to higher income taxes of million  which was partially offset by million of tax benefits 
other income increased million  primarily due the recognition of a gain on the sale of real estate that had previously been deferred pending the outcome of the middlesex rate case 
interest expense increased by million  primarily due to higher average long term borrowings as compared to the prior year period 
net income increased by to million from million in the prior year  and basic earnings per share increased from to 
diluted earnings per share increased from to 
the increase in earnings per share was impacted by the higher number of shares outstanding during the current year as a result of the sale of  shares of common stock in may results of operations in compared to operating revenues for the year rose million  or over the same period in customer growth of in delaware provided additional facility charges and connection fees of million 
higher base rates in our delaware service territories provided million of the increase 
for the year ended december   cool wet weather in the mid atlantic region pushed tidewater s consumption revenue down by million and middlesex consumption revenue down by million 
despite such adverse weather conditions  revenues from our operations and maintenance contracts rose million due to scheduled increases in fixed fees under the city of perth amboy contract 
new unregulated wastewater operations in delaware provided million in additional revenues 
our new meter services venture provided million in additional revenues 
all other operations accounted for million of the higher revenues 
operating expenses increased by million  or 
costs related to main breaks resulting from severe winter weather conditions in the first quarter of contributed to additional expenses of million 
there were also higher sewer disposal fees and security costs for usa pa that helped increase costs by million 
an increase in our delaware employee base  general wage increases and higher costs associated with employee medical and retirement benefits pushed up costs by million 
in new jersey  payroll costs  employee benefits and legal fees pushed up costs by million 
non regulated operations of meter installations and wastewater  which began in  contributed million of the overall expense increase 
water treatment  source of supply and pumping costs increased by million combined 
depreciation expense for increased by million  or  due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
allowance for funds used during construction rose for the year as tidewater s capital program included larger projects with longer construction schedules 
other taxes increased by million generally due to higher payroll related taxes and real estate taxes in both new jersey and delaware 
lower federal income taxes of million over last year are attributable to the reduced operating results for as compared to other income decreased by million as interest rates fell on short term cash balance investments 
interest expense increased by million due to a higher level of overall debt outstanding as compared to last year 
net income decreased to million from million and basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by to due to lower earnings 
outlook in addition to some of the factors previously discussed under results of operations in compared to  our revenues are expected to increase in from anticipated customer growth in delaware for our regulated operations and  to a lesser degree  from growth of non regulated operations in delaware and elsewhere 
we settled four rate cases during  from which we expect to receive the full annualized benefit in revenues and earnings will also be influenced by weather 
changes in these factors  as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs are the primary factors that determine the need for rate increase filings 
the level of revenues and earnings will be impacted by the ultimate timing and outcome of the anticipated base rate filing in new jersey during we continue to explore viable plans to streamline operations and reduce costs  particularly in delaware  where customer growth continues to exceed industry averages 
part of the challenge is that our delaware operations are a combination of over stand alone production and distribution systems serving communities 
as a result of anticipated regulation of wastewater services in delaware  we have established a new regulated wastewater operation that will commence operations during fiscal due to the start up nature of this operation  we expect our expenses with respect to this subsidiary to exceed its revenues in the near term 
we expect our interest expense to increase during as a result of incurring a full year of interest expense on the approximately million of long term debt we financed during fiscal and higher expected average borrowings and interest rates on short term credit facilities in order to finance a portion of our capital expenditures during the coming year see liquidity and capital resources 
our strategy includes continued revenue growth through acquisitions  internal expansion  contract operations and when necessary  rate relief 
we will continue to pursue opportunities in both the regulated and non regulated sectors that are financially sound  complement existing operations and increase shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations are largely based on three factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  and customer growth 
the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in results of operations 
for  cash flows from operating activities increased million to million  as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to improved profitability during the current year period and the timing of payments made toward prepaid expenses  materials and supplies  and employee benefit plans 
these increases in cash flows were partially offset by the timing of collection of customer accounts and payments to vendors 
the million of net cash flow from operations allowed us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures for the period internally  with the remainder funded with both short term and long term borrowings 
net proceeds from issuing long term debt were used to fund the balance of those expenditures 
for  net cash flow from operations of million  which increased over due to lower working capital requirements  and proceeds from prior year financings allowed us to find approximately of our utility plant expenditures 
net proceeds from issuing long term debt were used to fund the balance of those expenditures 
increases in certain operating costs will impact our liquidity and capital resources 
as described in our results of operations discussion  during we received rate relief for middlesex  tidewater and the pinelands companies 
we also plan to file for a base rate increase for middlesex in in conjunction with the completion of the raw water pipeline project see capital expenditures and commitments 
there is no certainty  however  that the bpu will approve any or all of this or other future requested increases 
sources of liquidity short term debt 
the board of directors has authorized lines of credit for up to an aggregate of million 
as of december   the company has established revolving lines of credit aggregating million 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under these credit lines were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of that date  the company had borrowing capacity of million under its credit lines 
the weighted average daily amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit lines and the weighted average interest rates on those amounts were million and million at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
long term debt 
subject to regulatory approval  the company periodically finances capital projects under state revolving fund srf loan programs in new jersey and delaware 
these government programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the financial markets 
a portion of the borrowings under the new jersey srf is interest free 
we participated in the srf loan programs during and will continue to pursue opportunities to participate as circumstances allow us in the future 
during  middlesex closed on million of first mortgage bonds through the new jersey environmental infrastructure trust njeit under the new jersey srf loan program in order to finance the costs of a new raw water pipeline and our and renew programs see capital expenditures and commitments for discussion of these projects 
the proceeds of these bonds and any interest earned are held by a trustee  and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
during  tidewater closed on a delaware srf loan of million to fund a portion of its multi year capital program 
the delaware srf program will allow  but does not obligate  tidewater to draw down against a general obligation note for three specific projects 
substantially all of the utility plant of the company is subject to the lien of its mortgage  which also includes debt service and capital ratio covenants  certain restrictions as to cash dividend payments and other distributions on common stock 
the company is in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions 
common stock 
the company periodically issues shares of common stock in connection with its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
periodically  the company may issue additional equity to reduce short term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 
during  the company issued million of common stock  which included a common stock offering of  shares that was priced at in may 
the majority of the net proceeds of approximately million from the common stock offering were used to repay most of the company s short term borrowings outstanding at that time 
capital expenditures and commitments as shown in the following table  we expect our capital expenditures in and to increase over these increases are attributable to a major pipeline installation in the middlesex system and continued customer growth and service improvement requirements in our tidewater systems in delaware  where we spent million on utility plant in at this time we have not determined any amounts anticipated to be spent by tesi in the table below 
millions of dollars delaware systems raw water line renew program scheduled upgrades to existing systems total under our capital program for  we plan to expend million for water system additions and improvements for our delaware systems  which include the construction of several storage tanks and the creation of new wells and interconnections 
we expect to spend approximately million to complete the new raw water line to the middlesex primary water treatment plant that began in we expect to spend million for the renew program  which is our program to clean and cement line unlined mains in the middlesex system 
there remains a total of approximately miles of unlined mains in the mile middlesex system 
in  nine miles of unlined mains were cleaned and cement lined 
the capital program also includes million for scheduled upgrades to our existing systems in new jersey 
the scheduled upgrades consist of million for improvements to existing plant  million for mains  million for service lines  million for meters  million for hydrants  and million for computer systems and various other items 
to pay for our capital program in  we will utilize internally generated funds and funds available under existing njeit loans currently  million and delaware srf loans currently  million 
the srf programs provide low cost financing for projects that meet certain water quality and system improvement benchmarks 
if necessary  we will also utilize short term borrowings through million of available lines of credit with four financial institutions 
as of december   we had million outstanding against the lines of credit 
going forward into through  we currently project that we will be required to expend approximately million for capital projects 
to the extent possible and because of the favorable interest rates available to regulated water utilities  we will finance our capital expenditures under the srf loan programs 
we also expect to use internally generated funds and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations in the course of normal business activities  the company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
some of these items result in direct obligations on the company s balance sheet while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  which are disclosed in the company s underlying consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of december  payment due by period millions of dollars less than more than total year years years years long term debt notes payable interest on long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations total guarantees usa pa operates the city of perth amboy s perth amboy water and wastewater systems under a service contract agreement through june  the agreement was effected under new jersey s water supply public private contracting act and the new jersey wastewater public private contracting act 
under the agreement  usa pa receives a fixed fee and a variable fee based on increased system billing 
scheduled fixed fee payments began at million in the first year and will increase over the term of the contract to million at the end of the contract 
in connection with the agreement  perth amboy  through the middlesex county improvement authority  issued approximately million in three series of bonds 
middlesex guaranteed one of those series of bonds  designated the series c serial bonds  in the principal amount of approximately million 
perth amboy guaranteed the two other series of bonds 
the series c serial bonds have various maturity dates with the final maturity date on september  as of december   approximately million of the series c serial bonds remained outstanding 
we are obligated to perform under the guarantee in the event notice is received from the series c serial bonds trustee of an impending debt service deficiency 
if middlesex funds any debt service obligations as guarantor  there is a provision in the agreement that requires perth amboy to reimburse us 
there are other provisions in the agreement that we believe make it unlikely that we will be required to perform under the guarantee  such as scheduled annual rate increases for the water and wastewater services as well as rate increases due to unforeseen circumstances 
in the event revenues from customers could not satisfy the reimbursement requirements  perth amboy has ad valorem taxing powers  which could be used to raise the needed amount 
critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
changes in these variables may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance provided in the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
in accordance with sfas no 
 costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded would be treated differently by the regulators in the future 
revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors and are not significant  are recorded upon approval of the amount by perth amboy 
pension plan we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all employees with more than  hours of service 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations has decreased from at december  to at december  to at december  lowering the discount rate by would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million in lowering the expected long term rate of return on the pension plans by from to would have increased the net periodic pension cost in by approximately million 
the discount rate for determining future pension obligations are determined based on market rates for long term  high quality corporate bonds at our december measurement date 
the expected long term rate of return for pension assets is determined based on historical returns and our asset allocation 
future actual pension income will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population participating in the pension plans 
recent accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment  which replaces sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees  except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
this statement is effective for quarters beginning after june  the company currently recognizes compensation expense at fair value for stock based payment awards in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and does not anticipate adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in quarters beginning after june  the company does not anticipate adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare drug act for employers who sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
fsp also requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the medicare drug act 
the medicare drug act generally permits plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits that are actuarially equivalent to the benefits of medicare part d to be eligible for a non taxable federal subsidy 
fsp is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  fsp provides that if the effect of the medicare drug act is not considered a significant event  the measurement date for the adoption of fsp is delayed until the next regular measurement date 
based on management s discussions with its actuary  management determined the effect of the medicare drug act was not considered a significant event and thus the company will account for the effects of fsp at its next measurement date january  
the adoption of fsp will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf further defines the meaning of an other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity securities 
impairment occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its cost basis 
when such a condition exists  the investor is required to evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary as defined in eitf when an impairment is other than temporary  the security must be written down to its fair value 
eitf also requires additional annual quantitative and qualitative disclosures for available for sale and held to maturity impaired investments that are not other than temporarily impaired 
on september   the fasb issued fsp eitf  effective date of paragraph s of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp eitf 
fsp eitf delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf until further implementation guidance is issued 
the company does not expect any material effects from the adoption of eitf on its financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of ten existing long term debt instruments will mature 
combining this amount with the million in short term debt outstanding at december   and applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings
