references to we  our  and us refer to sonicwall  inc and its subsidiaries 
overview sonicwall provides security  productivity and mobility solutions for businesses of all sizes 
our access security products are typically deployed at the edges of small to medium sized local area networks 
these networks are often aggregated into broader distributed deployments to support companies that do business in multiple physical locations  interconnect their networks with trading partners  or support a mobile or remote workforce 
our products are sold in over countries worldwide 
we generate revenues from the following sources the sale of products  the license of software applications that provide additional functionality to these products  the sale of ancillary subscription based services delivered through our products  and support and maintenance agreements for our products and software 
we currently outsource our manufacturing primarily to one contract manufacturer  flash electronics  under an agreement that provides for an initial term of one year and automatic renewal terms of one year each unless cancelled by either party upon days prior notice by either party 
outsourcing our manufacturing enables us to reduce fixed overhead and personnel costs and to provide flexibility in meeting market demand 
we design and develop the key components of our products 
in addition  we determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
product testing and burn in are performed by our contract manufacturer using tests that we specify 

table of contents we generally sell our products through distributors and value added resellers  who in turn sell our products to end user customers 
some of our resellers are carriers or service providers who provide solutions to the end user customers as managed services 
with current suggested retail prices ranging up to  we seek to provide our channel and customers with differentiated solutions that are innovative  easy to use  reliable  and provide good value 
to support this commitment  we dedicate significant resources to developing new products and marketing our products to our channels and end user customers 
key success factors of our business we believe that there are several key success factors of our business  and that we create value in our business by focusing on our execution in these areas 
channel we bring our products to market through distributors and resellers  who we believe provide a valuable service in assisting end users in the design  implementation and service of our security  productivity and mobility applications 
we support our distribution and channel partners with sales  marketing and technical support to help them create and fulfill demand for our offerings 
with this business model  we reduce the potential for conflict with our channel 
we are also focused on helping our channel partners succeed with our products by concentrating on cost efficiencies in the distribution channel  comprehensive reseller training and certification  and support for our channel s sales activities 
product and service platform our products serve as a platform for revenue generation for both us and our channel 
each appliance sale can result in additional revenue through the simultaneous or subsequent sale of add on software licenses  such as our global management system  or through the sale of additional value added services  such as our content filtering  anti virus  gateway anti virus and intrusion prevention service 
we plan to introduce more service options for our platforms  which will allow us to generate additional revenues from both our installed base of platforms as well as from those services coupled to incremental product sales 
distributed architecture our security solutions are based on a distributed architecture  which allow our offerings to be deployed and managed at the most efficient location in the network 
specifically  we can provide protection at the gateway and enforced protection at the client level  and we can monitor and report on network activity 
thus  we are providing our customers and their service providers with mechanisms to enforce the networking and security policies they have defined for their business 
we also use the flexibility of this architecture to allow us to enable new functionality in already deployed platforms through the provisioning of an electronic key  which may be distributed through the internet 
this ability provides benefits to both us and our end users  because there is no need to modify  physically adjust or replace devices  which might create a significant burden on the company  channel partner or end user where there are a large number of products installed or where the platforms are distributed over a broad area 
end user acceptance we began offering integrated security appliances in  and since that time we have shipped approximately  revenue units 
when measured by units shipped  we are typically among the top three suppliers in the markets in which we compete 
our experience in serving a broad market and installed base provides us with opportunities to become leaders in the areas of ease of use and reduced total cost of ownership 
additionally  our demonstrated end user acceptance provides our current and prospective channel partners with an increased level of comfort when deciding to offer our products to their customers 

table of contents integrated design our platforms utilize a highly integrated design in order to improve ease of use  lower acquisition and operational costs for our customers  and enhance performance 
each of our products ships with multiple ethernet network connections 
various models also integrate b g wireless access points  v 
analog modems  and isdn terminal adapters to support different connection alternatives 
every appliance also ships with pre loaded firmware to provide for rapid set up and easy installation 
each of these tasks can be managed through a simple web browser session 
our opportunities  challenges and risks international growth approximately of our revenue is derived from sales in the americas 
our percentage of sales from international territories does not represent the same degree of penetration of those markets as we have achieved domestically 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenues by increasing the international penetration rate to match the current domestic penetration rate 
if we fail to achieve our goal of greater international sales  we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who are able to amortize their product investments over a larger available market 
license and services revenues we believe that the software and services component of our revenue has several characteristics that are positive for our business as a whole the license and services revenues are associated with a higher gross margin than our product revenues  the services component of the revenues is recognized ratably over the services period  and thus provides in aggregate a more predictable revenue stream than product revenues  which are generally recognized at the time of the sale  and to the extent that we are able to achieve good renewal rates  we have the opportunity to lower our selling and marketing expenses attributable to that segment 
if we are successful in licensing our software and selling our services to both our installed base and in conjunction with our new product sales  we will likely be able to leverage incremental revenue out of each product transaction 
however  should we not achieve reasonable rates of selling associated services to our installed base or as part of new product sales  or witness lower service renewal rates  we risk having our revenues concentrated in more unpredictable and lower gross margin product and license sales 
macro economic factors affecting it spending we believe that our products and services are subject to the macro economic factors that affect much of the information technology it market 
growing it budgets and an increase of funding for projects to provide security  mobility and productivity could drive product upgrade cycles and or create demand for new applications of our products 
contractions in it spending can affect our revenues by causing projects incorporating our products and services to be delayed and or canceled 
vertical markets we have achieved significant sales in certain vertical markets  including the education  retail and healthcare industries 
we believe that we can increase our sales in these markets through dedicated marketing and sales efforts focused to the unique requirements of these vertical markets 
to the extent that we are able to do so  we expect to see revenue growth and increased sales and marketing efficiency 
should our efforts in these areas fall short of our goals  because of unsuitability of our products  increased competition  or for other reasons  we would expect to see a poor return on our marketing and sales investments in these areas 
critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in 
table of contents preparing our financial statements  including those related to sales returns and allowances  bad debt allowances  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  restructuring reserves  intangible assets  and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily four sources product revenue  licensing revenue from software  subscription revenues for services such as content filtering  anti virus protection  and intrusion prevention service  and other service revenues such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
we recognize product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a  sab no 
b and sab we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop no 
 as amended by statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is incidental  we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  to determine whether the provisions of sop applies to transactions involving the sale of products that include a software component 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title to the product and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
while our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
in these cases  interpretation of non standard provisions is required to determine the appropriate accounting for the transaction 
retroactive price protection rights tied to certain specific circumstances are contractually offered to the majority of the company s channel partners 
the company evaluates these rights carefully based on stock on hand in the channels that has been purchased within days of the price change with the exception of ingram micro and tech data 
revenue from these two distributors is not recognized until they sell the product to their customers 
as a consequence there is no adverse impact on recognized revenue 
in general  retroactive price adjustments are infrequent in nature 
at december    and  the company had a reserve for price protection in the amounts of    respectively 
delivery to domestic channel partners and international channel partners is generally deemed to occur when we deliver the product to a common carrier 
however  certain distributor agreements provide for rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to to of the distributor s prior to months purchases or other measurable restrictions  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
our two largest distributors  ingram micro and tech data  have rights of return under certain circumstances that are not limited  therefore we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro and tech data until they sell the product to their customers  at which time their right of return expires 
evidence of an arrangement is manifested by a master distribution or oem agreement  an individual binding purchase order or a signed license agreement 
in most cases  sales through our distributors and oem 
table of contents partners are governed by a master agreement against which individual binding purchase orders are placed on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond our normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  the sale of an appliance which includes a year of free maintenance or our content filtering service  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this allocation process means that we defer revenue from the arrangement equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize such amounts as revenue when the elements are delivered 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for subscriptions and services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention service  and extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
our training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty reserve 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns and price changes related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
in addition  we must make estimates based upon a combination of factors to ensure that our accounts receivable balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  deterioration in customer s operating results or financial position  customer concentrations  and customer credit worthiness  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
appliance products are generally covered by a warranty for a one to two year period 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 

table of contents valuation of inventory 
we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make since they are based  in part  on estimates of current and future economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account forecasted demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycles  projected obsolescence  current inventory levels  and purchase commitments 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross margin and earnings 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at june  because the determination was made that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the foreseeable future due to historical operating losses 
the net operating losses and research and development tax carryovers that make the vast majority of the deferred tax asset will expire at various dates through the year going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have demonstrated profitability for a period of time and begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  likely resulting in a significant benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate when this reversal might occur  if at all 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
as of january   we have adopted sfas and have ceased to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis  upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company s reporting units below their carrying value 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step a comparison of the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 

table of contents we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for purposes of sfas no 
since we currently only have one reporting unit  all of the goodwill has been assigned to the enterprise as a whole 
the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
we completed our annual review during the fourth quarter of and we have considered a number of factors to estimate the fair values  including independent third party valuations and appraisals  when making these determinations 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of our goodwill in fiscal and in  based on similar impairment tests performed  the market capitalization of our company decreased to a value below the reported carrying value due to a decline in our forecasted and actual revenue targets 
this resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the amount of million 
any further impairment charges recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
significant transactions acquisitions on november   we acquired phobos corporation phobos for million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
phobos designed  developed and sold scaleable ssl solutions for internet service providers  application service providers  e commerce companies and web hosting and enterprise network operations centers 
under the terms of the merger  shares of our common stock were exchanged for each share of outstanding phobos common stock on november   the closing date of the merger 
in connection with the merger  we issued  shares of our common stock and options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the purchase price of million was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the total purchase price was based upon the average fair value of our common stock for five trading days surrounding the date on which the acquisition was announced 
in addition  we paid million in cash to the shareholders of phobos based upon their pro rata ownership percentage in phobos 
the merger agreement also provided for up to an additional million in cash to be payable upon achievement of certain quarterly revenue targets during  of which million was earned and recorded as additional goodwill 
payments in the amount of million and million were made in and  respectively 
during the quarter ended june   we received  shares of our common stock from phobos in connection with the settlement and termination of the escrow fund  which resulted in a reduction of goodwill of approximately million 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of redcreek communications  inc redcreek in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
redcreek developed and sold standards based internet security products for corporate data communications networks that enable the secure transmission of data between offices over the internet 
the total purchase price was million including  in closing costs 
the purchase price of million was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
at the closing of the acquisition  we paid million in cash  assumed certain current accounts payable and other liabilities of redcreek  and forgave repayment of bridge loan amounts payable by redcreek to us that were used by redcreek to fund its operating expense from the date the purchase agreement was signed until the closing of the acquisition 
we also assumed redcreek s stock option plan and  options valued at approximately million issued thereunder 
during the course of  we completed several minor transactions for the acquisition of certain technologies and personnel for an aggregate purchase consideration of  shares of common stock valued at approximately million and approximately million in cash consideration 
the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
during the quarter ended december   we paid  in cash and issued  shares of our common stock related to one of our acquisitions in in addition  during the quarter ended september   we paid  in cash and issued  shares of our common stock valued at  related to the same acquisition 
we do not anticipate issuing any additional cash or shares related to these acquisitions

table of contents compared to revenue year ended december change to in thousands  except percentage data product percentage of total revenue license and service percentage of total revenue total revenue product revenue the increase in product revenues was across all geographies  and across both our tz series and pro series products 
the increase in as compared to was mainly due to an increase in the volume of units shipped 
during  we shipped approximately  units compared to  units during during revenue growth was fueled by the introduction and market acceptance of our new generation products  including the continued expansion of our tz access security appliance which we believe provides a compelling blend of ease of use for basic networks and flexibility for more complex networks 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced the tz as part of our tz series product offering which we believe provides a feature rich total security platform combining ease of use with the flexibility to meet the changing needs of small and medium sized networks 
in addition  we augmented our pro series product family with new product introductions over the past twelve months 
during the first quarter of we introduced the pro comprehensive network security  mobility and productivity solution 
during the second quarter of we introduced the pro  a gigabit class appliance that extended the upward range of our pro series product offering 
license and service revenue license and service revenue is comprised primarily of licenses and services such as node upgrades  intrusion prevention  gateway anti virus and anti virus protection  and content filtering services that are sold with appliances into the installed base of security appliances 
in addition  we generate license and service revenues from extended service contracts  licensing of our software  and professional services related to training  consulting and engineering services 
we expect the market opportunity for our subscription products in particular our intrusion prevention service  anti virus  and content filtering services sold to our installed base to increase as our installed base grows 
we are dedicating increased sales and marketing resources to sell into our installed base  and we are also focusing resources on marketing renewals for existing subscriptions 
during  revenues from our two primary subscription products  content filtering and anti virus  increased to approximately million from approximately million during during revenue from service contracts increased to approximately million from approximately million during the increase in subscription services and service contracts was primarily due to the increase in our installed based  increased marketing efforts  higher sales of software applications  and higher sales of subscription services sold in conjunction with our products 
channel data our sonicwall products are sold primarily through distributors who then resell our products to resellers and selected retail outlets 
distribution channels accounted for approximately of total revenues during compared to approximately during two of our distributors  ingram micro and tech data  both of which are major computer equipment and accessory distributors  combined account for approximately of our revenue during ingram micro and tech data combined account for approximately of our revenue during this year over year decrease in the concentration of sales with 
table of contents these two distributors as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to increased sales activity by other channel partners in the americas and by revenue increases in international markets where ingram micro and tech data do not represent as large a proportion of total products sold 
in addition to our distribution channels  we also sell our products to oems who sell our technologies under their brand names 
our oem revenues decreased to million during from million during  which primarily related to anticipated lower sales of our appliances to our oem partners as these agreements reach their end dates 
geographic revenue data year ended december change to in thousands  except percentage data americas percentage of total revenues emea percentage of total revenues apac percentage of total revenues total revenues the americas included non us net sales of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in the americas was primarily due to market acceptance of our new products combined with modest improvements in the economy which has resulted in increased it spending over previous levels 
the increase in revenues in emea was primarily due to the introduction and market acceptance of our new generation products  increased investment in sales and marketing personnel in the region  continued efforts to realign our distribution model and continued focus on recruiting large distributors that have the continued infrastructure to sell a broader range of products in expanded territories 
to increase the percentage of revenue in international markets  we intend to support these larger distributors in emea with sufficient product to enable them to grow sales in the region 
we plan on continually monitoring inventory levels in the channel to optimize lead times to meet customer demand 
we believe the increase in revenues in apac was primarily due to the introduction and market acceptance of our new generation products  our efforts in strengthening relationships with our channel partners combined with increased marketing activities in the regions 
in addition  the hiring of new sales management and dedicated senior sales personnel  has contributed to our growth in the apac region 
cost of revenue year ended december change to in thousands  except percentage data product gross margin license and service gross margin amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenue note effect of amortization of purchased technology has been excluded from product and license and service gross margin discussions below 

table of contents cost of product revenue  gross margin cost of product revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including cost of materials  manufacturing and assembly costs paid to contract manufacturers  amortization of purchased technology related to our acquisitions of phobos and redcreek  and related overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  warranty costs and inventory provisions or write downs are included in cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue increased primarily as a result of increased overall shipments 
we shipped approximately  units in  compared to approximately  units in gross margin from product sales increased to million  or of product revenue in  as compared to million  or of product revenue in the increase in product gross margin is primarily the result of increased sales of our new product offering which generate higher gross margins  such as the tz access security appliance and the pro series product family 
gross margin in was impacted by the write downs of inventory related to obsolete products  the proceeds from the subsequent sale of these obsolete products was less than  we expect gross margins to continue to be challenged by continued price competition 
we expect these effects to be moderated  however  by continued operational efficiencies  management of our cost structure and increased functionality of our offerings at attractive price points 
cost of license and service revenue  gross margin cost of license and service revenue includes all costs associated with the production and delivery of our license and service products  including cost of packaging materials and related costs paid to contract manufacturers  technical support costs related to our service contracts  royalty costs related to certain subscription products  and personnel costs related to the delivery of training  consulting  and professional services 
cost of license and service revenue increased in as compared to  as set forth in the table above 
this increase was due primarily to technical support costs to support our increased service contract offerings combined with the increased installed base 
to deliver services under these contracts  we outsourced a significant portion of our technical support function to third party service providers 
in addition  we opened an additional support center during the fourth quarter of gross margin from license and service sales increased to million  or of license and service revenues in from million  or of license and service revenues in the increase in the gross margin percentage as well as gross margin in absolute dollars related primarily to a higher mix of our subscription services and software licenses  which generate higher gross margins 
amortization of purchased technology year ended december change to in thousands  except percentage data expenses percentage of total revenue amortization of purchased technology represents the amortization of existing technology acquired in our business combinations accounted for using the purchase method 
purchased technology is being amortized over the estimated useful lives of three to six years 
amortization for both years ended december  and primarily consisted of million and  relating to the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisitions of phobos and redcreek  respectively 

table of contents future amortization to be included in cost of revenue based on current balance of purchased technology absent any additional investment is as follows in thousands fiscal year total our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of our offerings  new product introductions and enhancements  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes and the cost of components and manufacturing labor 
we must manage each of these factors effectively for our gross margins to remain at current levels 
operating expenses research and development year ended december change to in thousands  except percentage data expenses percentage of total revenue research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  outside testing services and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily as a result of increased personnel costs whereby salaries and related benefits increased by approximately million 
in addition  we created a compensation plan which is connected to the achievement of certain corporate goals whereby compensation costs increased by approximately million 
in particular  these increases were related to the development of new products and subscription services 
we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness  and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
we plan to continuously invest in current and future product development and enhancement efforts  and incur expense associated with these initiatives  such as prototyping expense and non recurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies 
we intend to continuously broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products 
sales and marketing year ended december change to in thousands  except percentage data expenses percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions  costs associated with the development of our business and corporate identification  costs related to customer support  travel  tradeshows  promotional and advertising costs  and related facilities costs 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to our expansion of international markets including increases in headcount  primarily in the areas of senior sales and marketing personnel  whereby salaries and related benefits increased by approximately million 
our sales support activities and co op advertising costs  and commissions expense increased by approximately million and million  respectively  due to an increase in revenues 
our travel related expenses increased by approximately million and  respectively  to support our expansion into international markets 

table of contents the decrease in the sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue is due to the increase in revenues and realignment of resources 
we expect to direct our sales and marketing expenses toward the expansion of domestic and international markets  introduction of new products and establishment and expansion of new distribution channels 
general and administrative year ended december change to in thousands  except percentage data expenses percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  directors and officers insurance  corporate governance costs  travel expense  and related facilities costs

the discounted cash flow methodology was the primary method used to determine the fair value for sfas no 
impairment purposes 
in performing these analyses  we used the best information available under the circumstances  including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future operating results

the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryovers that make up the vast majority of the deferred tax assets will expire at various dates through the year going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have demonstrated profitability for a period of time and begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  likely resulting in a significant benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate when this reversal might occur  if at all

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our short term investments as available for sale 
consequently  investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates change prior to maturity 
as stated in our investment policy  we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the majority of our short term investments maturing in more than one year are readily tradeable in to days 
due to this and the short duration of the balance of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  maturing in more less than than one one year year total in thousands  except percentage data short term investments weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets  which in the future may be denominated in various currencies 
because our sales are denominated in us dollars  the weakness of a foreign country s currency against the dollar could increase the price of our products in such country and reduce our product unit sales by making our products more expensive in the local currency 
a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not affect adversely our financial results in the future 
in addition  we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
