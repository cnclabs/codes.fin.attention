item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general meridian is an independent oil and natural gas company that explores for  acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties utilizing d seismic technology 
our operations are focused on the onshore oil and gas regions in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
our reserves and strategic acreage position provide us with a significant presence in our areas of focus  enabling us to manage a large asset base and to add successful exploratory and development wells at relatively low incremental costs 
the company s business model utilizing d seismic technology to explore for large reserve accumulations in areas where others have overlooked or not encountered commercial hydrocarbons because of the inability to resolve structures or recognize hydrocarbon indicators with traditional d seismic data  has proven successful 
during the period of  meridian generated and participated in the discovery of approximately bcfe of natural gas and oil 
as demonstrated from the apparent declines in domestic production  fewer and fewer economic projects are being recognized by the domestic industry 
this is partly a result of better technology that has improved the industry s ability to determine probabilities of success  thereby impacting the number of economic prospects available for drilling 
in addition  the conditions of the industry price volatility and uncertainty as well as declining prospect opportunities and the overall economy have influenced the availability of debt and equity capital for small capitalization companies such as meridian 
this  combined with the geological geophysical and mechanical risks associated with drilling primarily deep  high pressured wells with large working interests  has resulted in a shift in the company s strategy for exploration 
recognizing the trend and risks resulting therefrom  beginning in  management embarked on its current strategy to continue to utilize its application of d seismic technology to generate and drill shallower  higher confidence  lower risk plays  such as its biloxi marshlands project in st 
bernard parish  louisiana  blended with its traditional deeper  higher risk  but higher potential opportunities where its capital expenditure budget permits 
we have a large  balanced inventory of exploration  exploitation and development drilling prospects in our producing region 
in addition to a solid reserve base and acreage position in our area of focus  we believe we possess the technical knowledge and information necessary to sustain successful growth 
with licenses and rights to approximately  square miles of d seismic data  our technical and professional staff is in a position to continue to generate future prospects for our growth 
our strategy 
the key elements of our strategy are as follows generate reserve additions through exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition of a risk balanced portfolio of high potential projects  maintain a concise geographic focus in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico  applying professional and technical knowledge and experience to the development of a high quality project inventory  apply a rigorous methodology utilizing d seismic technology in the generation and development of lower risk exploration prospects  maximize our probability of success  optimize well locations and reduce our finding costs  maximize percentage ownership in each drilling prospect relative to probability of success  increasing the impact of discoveries on shareholder value  and maintain operational control to manage quality  costs and timing of our drilling and production activities 
we use a disciplined approach in the generation of drilling projects  which forms the basis of the company s ability to grow its reserves  production and cash flow 
the company s process of review begins with a thorough analysis of each project area using traditional geological methods of prospect development  combined with computer aided technology to analyze all available d and d seismic data and other geological and geophysical data with respect to the opportunity 
in addition  from time to time  we may purchase producing properties through acquisitions that have substantial additional drilling opportunities associated with them 
as of december   we had proved reserves of bcfe  approximately of which were natural gas  with a present value of future pre tax cash flows pv of million 
we own interests in approximately  gross  net acres  including fields and wells  and we operate approximately of our total production 
our reserves  strategic acreage position and d and d seismic data base provide us with a significant presence in our areas of focus  enabling us to exploit a large asset base adding to our multi year prospect inventory of exploratory and development plays and prospects  at a low incremental costs relative to our competition 
we own over  square miles of d seismic data 
it is no accident that we have focused in the gulf coast region of southeast texas and south louisiana 
although we have drilled and operated in over states and almost every producing basin in the domestic united states appalachia  mid continent  rocky mountains  arkoma  west texas  south texas  louisiana and the gulf of mexico shelf 
we chose this particular province because it presented the greatest opportunity for growth though exploration and exploitation 
complex geological fault traps capable of being resolved with d seismic and computer aided technology by a company willing to adopt it earlier than others  meant opportunities for by passed reserves 
highly prolific  potentially stacked producing sands with high producing rates compared to other regions meant lower risk for failure and quicker return of investments from successful wells 
we were successful with our efforts generating and or participating in the discovery of over bcfe 
yet  we recognized that long lead times were required to generate deep exploration targets and that the ability to use the technology to place the wells in optimum positions  high on structures and within traps frequently resulted in single well prospects that required a continual treadmill of exploration prospecting 
the result was a perception of greater risk to replace high flow rates and returns with a year reserve life rather than the much lower rate  longer lived plays in other regions 
during  we expanded our business plan to include lower risk  multiple well play opportunities using the seismic technology to identify what we believe are hydrocarbon indicators in shallower sections than we have historically drilled 
to date  we have been successful in the generation and development of several such plays  the first of which was the company s thornwell field in cameron parish  louisiana during since that time  we have successfully added our biloxi marshlands project area  a play that has expanded and complemented our exploration strategy with a uniquely large play that essentially gives meridian control over approximately  contiguous acres with proprietary d seismic covering over square miles 
we have used these resources to identify multiple shallower  low risk prospects in the area we believe will extend our drilling and producing operations for several years 
the successful drilling and resulting increases in production and cash flows from this play  together with the convergence of higher commodity prices  has significantly improved the financial condition of the company  its capital structure  balance sheet and liquidity  all of which combined with our large prospect inventory  provide the company with the potential for a very promising these include earnings per share applicable to common shareholders increased by average daily production increased by on a mcf equivalent basis 
total revenues increased by to million 
discretionary cash flow increased by  or million to million 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by to million 
debt to total capitalization declined to 
there has been a lot of talk about the biloxi marshlands play recently its merits and future opportunity 
simply put  biloxi is a cornerstone project for the company  one that not only confirmed our decision that we could reduce our exploration risk profile in an area that was written off by many as over explored  but also one that has served as a prelude to the other similar plays that we believe exist throughout our region of focus and where we own over  square miles of d seismic data 
since inception in  we have drilled wells at biloxi 
of them  have been completed as producers with wells either plugged and abandoned or determined to be uneconomic  and one well currently drilling 
we have purchased and acquired public and proprietary d seismic data in the area totaling over square miles  with plans to shoot an additional square miles during with over square miles of d seismic proprietary data  we have been successful at state of louisiana lease sales with the purchase of of the state tracts bid on  resulting in the acquisition of approximately  acres of state water bottoms over geological leads identified by the company 
since december  when we acquired our first land and seismic positions at biloxi  the company has expended a total of approximately million for all land  seismic  drilling and completions  production facilities and pipelines  over both evaluated and unevaluated areas 
we have received net field cash flow since first production in march  or under two years  of million 
biloxi marshlands represents a major and unique expansion of our company s exploration efforts in our region of focus 
the project represents the reality of a vision expanded by the hard work by a team of highly skilled and knowledgeable professionals who made a commitment to redefine an exploration plan that has positioned our company to move forward to new and similar multiple prospect  multiple well  lower risk exploration opportunities as the industry experiences a declining domestic reserve base 
management is committed to exploring the entire position in this play ensuring our knowledge base for elections of acreage positions prior to the expiration of our option period 
with the extensions to the south and east of our original discovery at atlas  we have successfully developed new and better processing and interpretive techniques that have provided a higher level of confidence for our future drilling efforts  not only at biloxi but also as we have taken and applied them to other in house surveys and extended the exploratory concept in our region  our back yard 
with this knowledge base and experience base  we have defined multiple other such prospect opportunities which will be drilled and tested during and which we believe have similar trapping conditions and producing characteristics as biloxi 
the company has set its capital budget at approximately million for new prospect opportunities ranging in depths from shallow to deep  exposing the company to unrisked reserves of approximately bcfe 
review of during  the company focused on corporate fundamentals financial  seismic  land and production 
the company reduced total debt by million  reducing its senior bank facility from million to million and sub debt in full from million 
in addition  outstanding preferred stock was reduced from a high of million in stated value of shares outstanding  to approximately million as a result of conversions to common stock 
by year end  the company s debt to book capitalization had been reduced from to 
during  wells were brought on line  increasing the average production from mmcfe per day to mmcfe per day or a increase 
during  meridian expects to further increase its reserves  production cash flow and earnings as a result of its strong inventory of prospects and d data base 
recent developments 
in furthering its focus on organic growth  the company is continuing to develop its biloxi marshlands and similar plays in south louisiana 
currently the company s south apollo prospect is expected to be placed on production within days  the turtle island well is expected to be placed on production within days  the hornet well has been drilled to its total depth and is expected to be logged and tested during march during the last several months  the company has participated in several state of louisiana oil and gas lease sales and during successfully bid on of additional tracts in the area  covering  acres in and around our current lease holdings 
it is believed that our high rate of success is because we hold the only proprietary d seismic over the area 
in an effort to further its development in the biloxi project area for future years  the company began the third phase of its d seismic program in january this approximately square mile d seismic survey is expected to be completed in may although meridian s focus is currently on the cris i geological time horizon  the survey is designed to look at all shallow and deep objectives 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
the average price we received during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  fluctuations in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas have several important consequences to us  including affecting the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase our exploration and development program 
refer to item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of commodity price risk management activities utilized to mitigate a portion of the near term effects of this exposure to price volatility 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues  which include oil and natural gas hedging activities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the twelve months ended december   increased million as compared to revenues due primarily to a increase in production volumes primarily from the company s previously announced drilling results in the biloxi marshlands bml project area and weeks island  coupled with successful workover operations in the company s ramos and weeks island fields  partially offset by natural production declines and property sales during further  revenues were enhanced by a increase in average commodity prices on a natural gas equivalent basis 
drilling and workover success increased our average daily production from mmcfe during to mmcfe for oil and natural gas production volume totaled  mmcfe for  compared to  mmcfe for during  the company s drilling activity was primarily focused in the biloxi marshlands bml project area and the weeks island field 
during  the company drilled or participated in the drilling of wells of which wells were completed and placed on production  representing a success rate

oil and natural gas operating expenses on an aggregate basis increased million to million in  compared to million in on a unit basis  lease operating expenses increased per mcfe to per mcfe for the year from per mcfe for the year oil and natural gas operating expenses increased primarily due to additional operating expenses associated with new wells and facilities in the bml project area and to increased workover activity in the weeks island  ramos and turtle bayou fields during the year  partially offset by savings resulting from sold properties in the latter portion of  combined with other cost savings initiated during the current year 
in  we expect our anticipated future increases in production to result in a continued reduction in operating costs on a per unit level 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily because of an increase in natural gas production and a higher natural gas tax rate  partially offset by a tax refund from louisiana for prior periods 
meridian s oil and natural gas production is primarily from louisiana and is therefore subject to louisiana severance tax 
the severance tax rates for louisiana are of gross oil revenues and per mcfe effective july  for natural gas 
for the first six months of  and the last six months of  the rate was per mcf for natural gas  an increase from per mcf for the first half of on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes decreased to per mcfe for from per mcfe for  reflecting a tax refund from louisiana for prior periods 
the per mcfe cost for will increase due to a higher anticipated average severance tax rate than what was experienced in depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense increased million during to million compared to million for this was primarily the result of the increase in production volumes in over levels  and an increase in the depletion rate as compared to the period 
on a unit basis  depletion and depreciation expenses increased to per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for we are expecting a downward trend in our depletion rate as we find and develop new reserves during the year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  increased million to million in compared to million for the year  primarily due to an increase in accounting and professional fees associated with implementing the expanded compliance burden required by the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in insurance costs primarily due to additional coverage and to increased production activity 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  general and administrative expenses increased per mcfe to per mcfe for compared to per mcfe for in  we anticipate a reduction in accounting and professional fees 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease was primarily a result of the reduction in long term borrowings 
with the conversion of the million convertible subordinated notes into common stock and the net repayments of million on our long term debt  the company will realize additional future savings in interest 
the reduction in long term debt was partly the result of our august common stock offering 
taxes on income 
the provision for income taxes for was million as compared to million for income taxes were provided on book income after taking into account permanent differences between book income and taxable income  and after reducing the income tax valuation allowance by million in adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
as a result  the company began recording long term liabilities representing the discounted present value of the estimated asset retirement obligations with offsetting increases in capitalized oil and gas properties 
this liability will continue to be accreted to its future value in subsequent reporting periods 
the company has charged approximately million and million to earnings as accretion expense during and  respectively 
in  the company recorded a long term liability of million representing the discounted present value of the estimated retirement obligations and an increase in capitalized oil and gas properties of million 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for totaled million or per share  and was charged to earnings in year ended december   compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues  which include oil and natural gas hedging activities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in average commodity prices

oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in lease operating expenses reflected savings realized on sold properties combined with other cost savings offset by additional operating expenses associated with the biloxi marshlands project area 
on a unit basis  lease operating expenses decreased per mcfe to per mcfe for the year from per mcfe for the year severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was largely attributable to the decrease in the average tax rate for natural gas and the decrease in oil revenues from the levels  partially offset by an increase in natural gas production 
meridian s production is primarily from southern louisiana  and  therefore  is subject to a current tax rate of of gross oil revenues and per mcf for natural gas effective july 
the tax rate for natural gas for the first half of was per mcf and from july through june was per mcf 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes decreased to per mcfe from per mcfe for the comparable period 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense increased million to million in from million for this increase was primarily a result of an increased depletion rate from levels  partially offset by the decrease in production on an mcfe basis from the comparable period in on a unit basis  depletion and depreciation expenses increased to per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for the increase in the depletion rate was primarily a result of the impairment of long lived assets mentioned below 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  decreased million to million in compared to million for the year during the first quarter of the company initiated reductions in staff to reflect a change in exploration strategy to lower risk  higher probability projects  maintaining focus in south louisiana and southeast texas 
in addition to the reduction in staff during the year  professional services decreased partially offset by an increase in insurance costs primarily for company directors and officers 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  general and administrative expenses were comparable for the two years 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease was primarily a result of the reduction in long term debt by million and the federal reserve bank s decrease in overall interest rates which led to a decrease in the average interest rate on the revolving credit facilities 
the funds for the reduction in debt were the result of the august stock offering  improved cash flow from operations and the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas properties 
impairment of long lived assets 
in  a write down in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves resulted in the company recognizing a non cash impairment of million of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
this was due to a negative revision associated with an unsuccessful well drilled in the kent bayou field in credit facility retirement costs 
during august  the company replaced its chase manhattan bank credit facility with a three year million underwritten senior secured agreement with societe generale and fortis capital corp 
deferred debt costs associated with the prior credit facility of million were written off in september taxes on income 
the provision for income taxes for was million 
income taxes were provided on book income after taking into account permanent differences between book income and taxable income  and after reducing the income tax valuation allowance by million 
the income tax for was a credit of million 
this credit resulted from the book loss after taking into account permanent differences between book income and taxable income 
this credit was limited to the amount of the company s deferred tax liability at december  adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
as a result  the company recorded a long term liability of million representing the discounted present value of the estimated retirement obligations and an increase in capitalized oil and gas properties of million 
the liability will be accreted to its future value in subsequent reporting periods and will be charged to earnings on the company s consolidated statement of operations as accretion expense 
as a result of adoption of sfas no 
 the company has charged approximately million to earnings as accretion expense during the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for prior years totaled million or per share  and was charged to earnings in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenue due to production and commodity price increases 
the year over year change in operating assets and liability from december   to december   also accounted for approximately million of increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to an increase in capital expenditures of million 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million for during  the company retired million in long term debt and paid million of preferred stock dividends  partially offset by the million raised by selling common stock 
common stock 
in august  the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the total proceeds of the offering  net of issuance costs  received by the company were approximately million 
the company repurchased all of the  shares of its common stock that were beneficially owned by shell oil company for million and a portion of the remaining proceeds of that equity offering were used to repay borrowings under the company s senior secured credit agreement  which resulted in an increase in funds available to the company to accelerate planned capital expenditures for drilling activities and related pipeline construction 
the repurchased  shares of common stock that were held in treasury stock were retired as of september  in august  the company completed a private offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the total proceeds of the offering  net of issuance costs  received by the company were approximately million 
the company used the majority of these funds to retire million in long term debt  with the remainder of the proceeds being used for exploration activities and other general corporate purposes 
as discussed below  during the nine months ended september   approximately million shares of common stock and approximately million shares of common stock were issued for the early conversion and retirement of the convertible subordinated notes 
current credit facility 
on december   the company amended its existing credit facility to provide for a four year million senior secured credit facility the credit facility with fortis capital corp  as administrative agent  sole lead arranger and bookrunner  comerica bank as syndication agent  and union bank of california as documentation agent 
bank of nova scotia and allied irish banks plc completed the syndication group 
the initial borrowing base under the credit facility is million 
as of december   outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled million 
the credit facility is subject to semi annual borrowing base redeterminations on april and october of each year 
in addition to the scheduled semi annual borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders or the company have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time  provided that no party can request more than one such redetermination between the regularly scheduled borrowing base redeterminations 
obligations under the credit facility are secured by pledges of outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and by a first priority lien on not less than in the case of an event of default of its present value of proved oil and gas properties 
in addition  the company is required to deliver to the lenders and maintain satisfactory title opinions covering not less than of the present value of proved oil and gas properties 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on cash dividends on common stock and under certain circumstances preferred stock  limitations on the redemption of preferred stock and an unqualified audit report on the company s consolidated financial statements  with all of which the company is in compliance

at december   the three month libor interest rate was 
the credit facility also provides for commitment fees of calculated on the difference between the borrowing base and the aggregate outstanding loans under the credit facility 
former credit facility 
during august  the company replaced its chase manhattan bank credit facility with a three year million underwritten senior secured credit agreement the former credit agreement with societe generale as administrative agent  lead arranger and book runner  and fortis capital corporation  as co lead arranger and documentation agent 
borrowings under the former credit agreement were to mature on november   as extended by an amendment dated november  the amendment was subject to an extension fee of  to be paid in the event the credit facility had not been paid or refinanced by january  the borrowing base was set at million effective on october  credit facility payments of million were made during the first nine months of  bringing the outstanding balance to million as of september  the company made a final debt repayment of million on december   which paid off in full this loan agreement 
in addition to the scheduled quarterly borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders or borrower  under the former credit agreement  had the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time  once during each calendar year 
borrowings under the former credit agreement were secured by pledges of outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and a mortgage on the company s oil and natural gas properties of at least of its present value of proved properties 
on october   the company notified societe generale that the present value of the mortgaged oil and gas properties total 
the company received a waiver of the test in anticipation of the new fortis senior secured credit facility requiring only a mortgage test 
the former credit agreement contained various restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on cash dividends on common stock and under certain circumstances preferred stock  and an unqualified audit report on the company s consolidated financial statements 
under the former credit agreement  the company could have secured either i a an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate  or b federal funds based rate plus  plus an additional to depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base or  ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus to  depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
the former credit agreement also provided for commitment fees ranging from to per annum 
subordinated credit agreement the company extended and amended a short term subordinated credit agreement with fortis capital corporation for million on april   with a maturity date of december  the notes were unsecured and contained customary events of default  but did not contain any maintenance or other restrictive covenants 
the interest rate was libor plus from january   through august   and libor plus from september   through december  at december   the three month libor rate was 
note payments totaling million were paid in  with an additional million paid in a note payment of million was made during april  with the remaining million paid in december convertible subordinated notes during june  the company completed private placements of an aggregate of million of its convertible subordinated notes due june  the notes were unsecured and contained customary events of default  but did not contain any maintenance or other restrictive covenants 
interest was payable on a quarterly basis 
the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under this agreement 
during march  the company and the holders of the notes amended the conversion price from to per share 
the notes were convertible at any time by the holders of the notes into shares of the company s common stock  par value  utilizing the conversion price 
the conversion price was subject to customary anti dilution provisions 
the holders of the notes were granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the notes 
during march  the notes were converted into million shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share  and included an additional non cash conversion expense of approximately million that was incurred and paid via the issuance of common stock priced at market 
all of the common stock issued in connection with the conversion of the notes was issued under section of the securities act 
redeemable convertible preferred stock 
a private placement under section and regulation d of the securities act of million of redeemable convertible preferred stock was completed during may the preferred stock is convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share

the conversion was completed on a pro rata basis and included a cash payment for accrued and unpaid dividends through the june   conversion date  at which time dividends ceased to accrue on the converted shares 
during the year  a total of million of preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in consisted of million for property and equipment additions primarily related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  production facilities  and related drilling and workover activities 
our strategy is to blend exploration drilling activities with high confidence workover and development projects selected from our broad asset inventory in order to capitalize on periods of high commodity prices 
this strategy brought on production and added reserves sooner than the drilling of deep  higher risk exploration wells 
the capital expenditures plan is currently forecast at approximately million 
the final projects will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing and the level of cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate funding the plan primarily utilizing cash flow from operations 
when appropriate  excess cash flow from operations beyond that needed for the capital expenditures plan will be used to de lever the company by development of exploration discoveries or direct payment of debt 
sale of properties 
during  the company sold certain non strategic oil and gas properties located in south louisiana for approximately million 
the sale was comprised of approximately bcfe proved developed reserves and bcfe of undeveloped reserves 
benefits of the sale include the reduction of total debt by an additional million resulting in an immediate savings in interest costs on the company s senior bank debt  the elimination of million in future capital expenditures associated with the properties  and the elimination of over million in annual lease operating expenses 
cash obligations

it is our policy to retain existing cash for reinvestment in our business  and therefore  we do not anticipate that dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock in the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   million of dividends were accumulated net of million of deferred preferred stock offering costs amortized during  of which million was paid in cash in july and million was paid in cash in january during  dividends of million were accumulated net of million of deferred preferred stock offering costs amortized during  of which million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock and million was paid in cash in january dividends of million were accumulated during net of million of deferred preferred stock offering costs amortized during  of which million was paid in cash and million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties 
all costs incurred with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
included in capitalized costs are general and administrative costs that are directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
for the years   and  such capitalized costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool  except in transactions involving a significant quantity of reserves or where the proceeds received from the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss would be recognized 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and are included in our amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs 
the provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties is computed by the unit of production method 
under this computation  the total unamortized costs of oil and natural gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage value  excluding costs of unproved properties  are divided by the total estimated units of proved oil and natural gas reserves at the beginning of the period to determine the depletion rate 
this rate is multiplied by the physical units of oil and natural gas produced during the period 
the cost of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining impairment  an evaluation is performed on current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarter  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  after deducting the asset retirement obligation  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify a revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
during  a negative revision in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves associated with the kent bayou field resulted in the company recognizing a full cost ceiling write down totaling million million after tax of its oil and natural gas properties 
due to the imprecision in estimating oil and natural gas revenues as well as the potential volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
price risk management activities 
the company follows the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
cash flow hedge accounting for qualifying hedges allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the earnings statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we adopted fas effective january  the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  the company has entered into various swap agreements 
these swaps allow the company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges as provided by fas and any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item 
any changes in fair value resulting from the ineffectiveness of the hedge are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of revenues 
the company recognized minimal losses related to hedge ineffectiveness during the two years ended december   and a gain of  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the change in estimated fair value of the company s oil and natural gas swaps was an unrealized loss of million million net of tax which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
based upon december   oil and natural gas commodity prices  approximately million of the loss deferred in other comprehensive income could potentially lower gross revenues in the swap agreements expire at various dates through october  net settlements under these swap agreements reduced oil and natural gas revenues by  and  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional discussion of disclosures about market risk 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings and subordinated notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based on quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair value of our subordinated notes due was million at december  the carrying value of our subordinated notes was million at december  new accounting pronouncements 
on september   the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab regarding the application of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations aros  by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method 
pursuant to sab  oil and gas producing companies that have adopted sfas should exclude the future cash outflows associated with settling aros aro liabilities from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues for the purposes of the full cost ceiling calculation 
in addition  estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  that have been capitalized aro assets should be included in the amortization base for computing depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
disclosures are required to include discussion of how a company s ceiling test and depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations are impacted by the adoption of sfas sab is effective prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after october  since our adoption of sfas on january   we have calculated the ceiling test and our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in accordance with the interpretations set forth in sab  therefore  the adoption of sab had no effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r which is a replacement statement to sfas no 
entitled share based payment 
this statement also amends sfas statement this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
this statement would be effective for interim periods beginning after june  the impact on the results of operations would be similar to the pro forma disclosures included in the notes to the financial statements 
forward looking information from time to time  we may make certain statements that contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of and that involve risk and uncertainty 
these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to exploration and seismic acquisition plans  anticipated results from current and future exploration prospects  future capital expenditure plans  anticipated results from third party disputes and litigation  expectations regarding compliance with our credit facility  the anticipated results of wells based on logging data and production tests  future sales of production  earnings  margins  production levels and costs  market trends in the oil and natural gas industry and the exploration and development sector thereof  environmental and other expenditures and various business trends 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing including  but not limited to  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other sections of our filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including  but not limited to the following changes in the price of oil and natural gas 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the level of such production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors that we do not control  including seasonality  worldwide economic conditions  the condition of the united states economy particularly the manufacturing sector  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing countries  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
material declines in the prices received for oil and natural gas could make the actual results differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
operating risks 
the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas  including uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids into the environment including groundwater and shoreline contamination  blowouts  cratering  mechanical difficulties  fires  explosions  unusual or unexpected formation pressures  pollution and environmental hazards  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and natural gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
in addition  we are subject to other operating and production risks such as title problems  weather conditions  compliance with government permitting requirements  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment  reductions in product prices  limitations in the market for products  litigation and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against certain of these risks either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we cannot predict if or when any such risks could affect our operations 
the occurrence of a significant event for which we are not adequately insured could cause our actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
drilling risks 
our decision to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit a prospect or property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis  production data and engineering studies  which may be imprecise 
therefore  we cannot assure you that all of our drilling activities will be successful or that we will not drill uneconomical wells 
the occurrence of unexpected drilling results could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
uncertainties in estimating reserves and future net cash flows 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas we cannot measure in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
reserve estimates may be imprecise and may be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
borrowing base for the credit facility 
the credit agreement with fortis capital corp 
is presently scheduled for borrowing base redetermination dates on a semi annual basis  with the next such redetermination scheduled for april  the borrowing base is redetermined on numerous factors including current reserve estimates  reserves that have recently been added  current commodity prices  current production rates and estimated future net cash flows 
these factors have associated risks with each of them 
significant reductions or increases in the borrowing base will be determined by these factors  which  to a significant extent  are not under the company s control 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is from time to time exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility 
since interest charged borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility 
hedging contracts meridian may address market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into swaps and other derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of the company during the periods presented 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our proved developed natural gas production and of our proved developed oil production during the respective terms of the hedging agreements 
the fair values of the hedges are based on the difference between the strike price and the new york mercantile exchange future prices for the applicable trading months 
the fair value of our hedging agreements is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities
