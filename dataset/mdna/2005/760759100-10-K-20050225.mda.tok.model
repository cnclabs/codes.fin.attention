item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form k 
overview of our business we are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states 
we provide solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states 
we also own or operate transfer stations  solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations 
our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal  recycling  compost  mulch and soil operations 
the following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended december   and in millions years ended december  collection residential commercial industrial other total collection transfer and disposal less intercompany transfer and disposal  net other revenue our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets derive revenue from long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our revenue from landfill services is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes transfer  disposal  labor  self insurance  fuel and equipment maintenance costs 
we try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal 
during the three months ended december   approximately of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 
our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized  and charged to expense based upon 
table of contents the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 
our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions which we designate as our reportable segments 
from to  operating income increased in our eastern  southern and western regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy 
in the central region  increased revenue was offset by weak economic conditions and an increase in costs related to the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors 
in the southwestern region  revenue growth was impeded by the closure of a landfill and the completion of a special waste contract during the decrease in costs for corporate entities from to is primarily due to a decrease in self insurance expense 
financial objectives in january  we publicly announced our objectives for the year 
these objectives included the following generating free cash flow of approximately million 
using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october and continuing to pay quarterly cash dividends 
generating diluted earnings per share of to 
growing revenue from core operations by  with approximately attributable to price increases and attributable to volume growth 
purchasing approximately million of property and equipment 
business performance during  we achieved our earnings per share objective and exceeded our internal growth  free cash flow and share repurchase objectives 
our internal growth from core operations for was  with from price increases and from volume growth 
during  our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business  including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts  and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts 
our core volume growth was also positively impacted by the hurricanes 
in addition  our geographic mix of business  which is concentrated in high growth markets  positively impacted our operating results 
as a result  during we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year 
during  our operating margins improved  primarily due to lower self insurance expense 
this benefit was partially offset by increased costs for fuel  labor and subcontracting costs associated with the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors 
the net expansion in our operating margin allowed us to achieve diluted earnings per share of during the year ended december  
table of contents during  we generated free cash flow of million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of million  less purchases of property and equipment of million  plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million  which substantially exceeded our objective 
our free cash flow was positively impacted by lower than expected cash taxes due to bonus depreciation and our change in tax method related to certain landfill costs 
in april  our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization from million to million 
during  we used our free cash flow to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock for million 
also  during the third quarter of  our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to 
per share 
financial objectives our financial objectives for assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter specific guidance is as follows we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of million 
we anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october and to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends 
we anticipate diluted earnings per share of to 
we are targeting internal growth from core operations to be in the range of to  with attributable to price increases and to attributable to volume growth 
we anticipate purchasing approximately million of property and equipment 
we expect our free cash flow during to be lower than and because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation  higher purchases of property and equipment and several one time items that benefited previous periods  including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during  and an increase in self insurance reserves during business initiatives our business initiatives for are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior three years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems 
ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives 
our business initiatives for are as follows pricing initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business 
the purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs and improve operating margins 
we realized the benefit of this initiative during and expect a similar benefit during improve the quality of our revenue 
the first step in this process was completed in and included installing a standardized billing and operating system 
this system enables us to  among other things  stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing 
during  we implemented the second generation of this software which we call rsi rsi  our company s core business system  provides a variety of functionalities including customer service  dispatch  billing  sales analysis  account retention and route productivity analysis 
during  we will begin to develop the next generation of our billing and operating system 
this system will provide additional functionality to our operating locations and further standardize our billing and operating processes 
we currently monitor our return on investment by market place and have instituted a return on investment pricing model 
this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 

table of contents during  we also implemented a customer relationship management system 
this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
during  we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended 
improve the productivity of our operations 
we use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers 
in addition  in our larger markets  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density 
during  we will continue to update our disposal optimization metrics 
these metrics identify which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow 
improve fleet management and procurement 
in february  we selected dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system 
during  we implemented dossier at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations 
among other features  this system tracks parts inventories  generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work 
it allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations 
in addition  the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory 
during  we intend to further utilize this purchase order module to take advantage of volume discounts 
enhance operational and financial reporting systems 
we have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems 
the overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information  prepared in a consistent manner  that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business 
one of our most significant systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package 
we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson general ledger software in and in successfully converted all of our locations to lawson fixed asset software 
all of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information  thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions 
in addition  during  all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale  florida 
this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines 
it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan  if necessary 
expand our safety training programs 
as part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of increasing insurance costs  we expanded our safety training programs in during  we distributed to all of our locations a comprehensive training and safety manual 
safety will continue to be a key area of focus during develop and implement performance strategies 
develop and implement strategies to improve the performance of locations and lines of business that are performing below the company s average 

table of contents critical accounting policies and disclosures our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows  and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference landfill accounting life cycle accounting we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers 
changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization  depletion  and accretion expense 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations landfill and environmental matters 
note  accrued landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 
probable expansion airspace we include in our calculation of total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying each of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion  and accretion expense could change significantly

note  accrued landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference final capping  closure and post closure prior to january   costs for final closure of our landfills and costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance were charged to cost of operations based upon consumed airspace using the units of consumption method 
these costs were not inflated or discounted to the present value of total estimated costs 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas  obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill life 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill  depending upon the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the company s credit adjusted  risk free rate 
total future costs for capping  closure and post closure are developed annually by engineers 
changes in these estimates could affect our amortization of final capping  closure and post closure costs and our accretion expense

note  accrued landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference self insurance our insurance programs for worker s compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially 
if actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates  our self insurance expense would change 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selected balance sheet accounts 
note  commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment expenditures for improvements  repairs and maintenance expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized 
all expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment 
accordingly  the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations property and equipment 
note  summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements 
useful lives property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation and amortization expense are provided over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets using the straight line method 
the estimated useful lives are seven to forty years for buildings and improvements  five to twelve years for vehicles  seven to ten years for most landfill equipment  three to fifteen years for all other equipment  and five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures 
our estimates regarding the useful lives of our depreciable assets are based on our judgment 
accordingly  actual useful lives could differ from our estimates

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference capitalized interest we capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost 
capitalizing too little or too much interest expense could lead to a misstatement of interest expense in the statement of income 
in order to minimize this risk  construction projects must meet the following criteria before interest is capitalized total construction costs are  or greater  the construction phase is one month or longer  and the assets have a useful life of one year or longer

note  summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue and accounts receivable revenue consists primarily of collection fees from various customer types and transfer and landfill disposal fees charged to third parties 
advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the past three years 
reserves for accounts receivable are provided when a receivable is believed to be uncollectible or generally when a receivable is in excess of days old 
establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment 
if our judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect  bad debt expense would change

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference derivatives from time to time  we use derivatives to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and diesel fuel prices 
these derivatives have been accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the hedging relationships we have entered into are expected to be either effective or highly effective and have been determined to meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
if  in the future  these relationships are no longer expected to be or highly effective  or if they no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting  our results of operations could change

note  debt  and note  fuel hedge in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference long lived asset impairments long lived assets consist primarily of property  equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of long lived assets or whether the remaining balance of these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
we use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
in testing for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each operating segment of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying values 
if the fair value of an operating segment is greater than its carrying value  no impairment results 
we measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value 
our estimates of future cash flows and fair values are based on our judgment 
accordingly  we could designate certain assets as impaired that are not and fail to identify certain impaired assets

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
after the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating losses for tax purposes are based upon our judgment 
if our judgment and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating losses are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december   and the aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was million  million and million  respectively 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december  we had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of  million 
during  million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 
as of december   we had million of landfill development costs  net of accumulated depletion and amortization  which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs 
when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets  purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired primarily final capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace  which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate

table of contents revenue increased by million  or  from to the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december   and core price fuel surcharges recycling commodities total price core volume non core volume total volume total internal growth acquisitions taxes a total revenue growth a represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers 
during the year ended december   our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business  including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts  and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts 
our internal growth from our core operations was in during the first three quarters of  we experienced moderate growth in revenue due to an increase in core pricing 
during the fourth quarter of  our revenue growth from core pricing increased at a more rapid pace due to our broad based pricing initiative 
during  the economic slowdown which began during continued to negatively impact our business 
however  during  our revenue growth from core volume continued to be positively impacted by long term franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during our internal growth from core operations was in the economic slowdown which began in continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction industry during volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during the weakness in our business attributable to the economic slowdown was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices in the early part of despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above  our internal growth from core operations for was 
during  we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts 
we also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets 
outlook we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be in the range of to during assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of however  our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in depending upon economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives 
cost of operations 
cost of operations was  million   million and  million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents the increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to and the decrease in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily attributable to higher self insurance expense in self insurance expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in self insurance expense in related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through the policy year 
excluding self insurance expense  cost of operations as a percentage of revenue increased during the year ended december  versus the comparable period 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased fuel prices  labor costs and subcontracting costs associated with the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors 
excluding self insurance expense  cost of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased in versus the comparable period due to the elimination of closure and post closure expense as a component of cost of operations in accordance with sfas in and the termination of our operating lease facility in july this decrease was partially offset by increased fuel prices  an increase in waste taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states  an increase in revenue generated by lines of business that produce lower operating margins and an increase in the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors 
to date in  we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices 
we believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high depending upon the cost of fuel  health insurance  risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and general economic conditions 
depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment 
depreciation  amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars from to is primarily due to the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions 
the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with the adoption of sfas the remaining increase from to is due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures  acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired  but also includes values assigned to long term contracts  covenants not to compete and customer relationships 
expenses for amortization of intangible assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   
and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to amortization expense on amounts that were recorded in other intangible assets during the three months ended september  resulting from an extensive internal review of all recent acquisitions 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars is also due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with businesses acquired during accretion expense 
accretion expense was million and million or  as a percentage of revenue  
and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  versus for accretion expense resulted from the adoption of sfas as of january  the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in is primarily due to expansion of our landfill operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to higher compensation costs 
the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to leveraging our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base 

table of contents we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses in the range of of revenue are appropriate for given our business platform 
other charges income 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made and recorded as other charges during the fourth quarter of operating income 
operating income was million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense 
we incurred interest expense on our unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in may  million of our public notes matured and were repaid resulting in a reduction in interest expense  which was partially offset by increases in interest expense resulting from additional tax exempt financing obtained during the increase in interest expense from to is due to higher debt balances resulting from additional tax exempt financings partially offset by lower interest rates 
capitalized interest was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income and other income expense  net 
interest income and other income  net of other expense  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash  restricted cash and marketable securities balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during in may  we used a portion of our outstanding cash and restricted cash and marketable securities balances to repay million of public notes 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december   and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
during the first quarter of  we adopted sfas sfas required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping  closure and post closure costs related to our landfills 
as of january   we recorded an after tax expense of million  or million on a pre tax basis  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas in addition  we also recorded an after tax expense of million  or million on a pre tax basis  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems 
this change in accounting principle for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of sfas and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry

changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in south carolina  changes in engineering estimates and changes in design partially offset by consumption 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken  two landfills that were acquired during the year and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates 
during  total available airspace decreased by million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption partially offset by the acquisition of a landfill 
as of december   we owned or operated solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum 
table of contents of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 
billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet our expansion criteria 
see note  accrued landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   twelve of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these twelve landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december  number of sites without number of sites with total percent expansion airspace expansion airspace sites of total to years to years to years to years years total sites with expansion airspace include four landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace 
final capping  closure and post closure costs as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping  closure and post closure costs 
see note  accrued landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   accrued final capping  closure and post closure costs were million

as of december   we expect to spend an estimated additional  million on existing landfills  primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures  over their expected remaining lives 
our total expected gross investment  excluding non depletable land  estimated to be billion  or per cubic yard  is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method 
we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace  as appropriate

liquidity and capital resources the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december   and are discussed below 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business  the timing of payments received for accounts receivable  and the timing of payments for accounts payable and income taxes 
in december  we received written approval from the internal revenue service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization  depletion  and final capping  closure and post closure costs for tax purposes 
as a result of this change  we recorded a tax receivable of approximately million which was collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended december  also during the year ended december   we collected a million note receivable associated with a divested business 
we expect our cash flow from operating activities during to be lower than and because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation and several one time items that benefited previous periods  including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during  and an increase in self insurance reserves during we use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases  dividend payments and debt repayments 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and consists primarily of cash used for capital additions and business acquisitions for all the periods presented and cash provided by restricted marketable securities in capital additions were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used to acquire businesses  net of cash acquired  was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in restricted marketable securities during consists of amounts transferred from unrestricted cash for financial guarantees 
in  we liquidated a portion of these marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the million of public notes 
we used letters of credit to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities that were liquidated 
we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand  cash flows from operations  our revolving credit facility  tax exempt bonds and other financings 
we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and primarily include proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds  repayments of debt and repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program 
dividends paid were million and million during and  respectively 
in  repayments of debt include the liquidation of million of public notes 
from through  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  million of our common stock 
as of december   we paid million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock  of which million was paid during to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock 

table of contents in december  we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
in july  we retired this facility using our excess cash 
we used proceeds from our cash on hand  liquidation of marketable securities  cash flow from operations  and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt 
we intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  our revolving credit facility and other financings 
credit rating our company has received investment grade credit ratings 
as of december   our senior debt was rated bbb positive by standard poor s  bbb positive by fitch and baa by moody s 
operating lease facility in december  we entered into a million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
in july  we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying million using our excess cash  which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time 
fuel hedge during june  we entered into option agreements for approximately million gallons of heating oil 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases 
these option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts expiring in december the option agreements were structured as zero cost collars indexed to the price of heating oil 
in accordance with sfas  million net of tax  representing the effective portion of the change in fair value has been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended december  the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of approximately 
million for the year ended december  has been included in other income  expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
realized losses of 
million for the year ended december  related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions maturities of notes final payable and capping  amounts due unconditional operating capital long term closure and to former purchase year ending december  leases leases debt post closure remediation owners commitments total thereafter total the estimated remaining final capping  closure and post closure expenditures presented above are undiscounted and include both payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december  and estimated future liabilities expected to be incurred as the remaining landfill disposal capacities are consumed 

table of contents unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of long term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third party facilities 
we do not have or engage in any off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor 
we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
all items described below are non trading 
expected maturity date fair value asset liability december  thereafter total variable rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates interest rate swaps amount outstanding in millions average interest rates the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards gaap  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from the sale of property and equipment free cash flow we expect our free cash flow during to be lower than and because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation  higher purchases of property and equipment and several one time items that benefited previous periods  including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during  and an increase in self insurance reserves during we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment  net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform  repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our shareholders  paying cash dividends  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or 
table of contents that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
seasonality our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites  or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted by public companies no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously reflected in their sfas pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in  and  respectively
