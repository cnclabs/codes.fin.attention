 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires the estimated fair market value of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expense in the income statement 
the company will be required to adopt sfas r at the beginning of its third fiscal quarter ending october  the company is currently evaluating the impact and expects adopting sfas r will cause a significant increase in expense 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which adopts wording from the international accounting standards board s ias inventories in an effort to improve the comparability of international financial reporting 
the new standard indicates that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the effect of sfas no 
and does not expect it to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth the company s unaudited quarterly operating results for the eight most recent quarterly periods 
the financial information gives effect to the restatement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in thousands  except per share data and number of stores fiscal quarters ended may  july  october  january  as restated as restated as restated net sales gross profit net income net income per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period in thousands  except per share data and number of stores fiscal quarters ended may  august  november  january  as restated as restated as restated as restated net sales gross profit net income net income per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period the company s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the fourth quarter holiday season 
due to the importance of the holiday selling season  the fourth quarter of each fiscal year has historically contributed  and the company expects it will continue to contribute  a disproportionate percentage of the company s net sales and most of its net income for the entire fiscal year 
any factors negatively affecting the company during the holiday selling season in any year  including unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally experiences lower sales and earnings during the first three quarters and  as is typical in the retail industry  may incur losses in these quarters 
the results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year 
in addition  the company makes decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
significant deviations from projected demand for products could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  either by lost gross sales due to insufficient inventory or lost gross margin due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as delays in the flow of merchandise  the ability to realize the expected operational and cost efficiencies from its distribution centers  the number and timing of store openings and related store preopening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings or relocations  competitive factors  changes in fuel and other shipping costs  general economic conditions  geopolitical conditions  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  labor market fluctuations  changes in accounting rules and regulations and unseasonable weather conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates cost plus  inc s and its subsidiaries discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  inventory values  fixed asset lives  intangible asset values  deferred income taxes  self insurance reserves and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including the retail inventory method of accounting for inventories and the intrinsic value method to account for common stock options 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on operating results by using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
although not all inclusive  the company believes that the following represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise  net of discounts and an allowance for estimated returns  at the time the merchandise is sold 
the allowance for sales returns is based on historical experience and was approximately million for each of fiscal  and inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the retail inventory method rim  in which the valuation of inventories at cost and gross margins is calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  the company s use of the rim results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as gross margin 
to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory  the company s rim utilizes multiple departments in which fairly homogeneous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns could result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
when necessary  the company records a markdown allowance that reduces inventory value to the lower of cost or market 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
insurance benefits the company records estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insurance programs with per occurrence and aggregate limits on losses 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
other accounting estimates estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements include those associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of recorded deferred tax assets  the adequacy of recorded deferred tax liabilities  the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets and those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to litigation  claims and assessments 
various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historic experience and current and expected economic conditions 

table of contents the company periodically reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
to date  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and the adequacy of the recorded deferred tax liability 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
if the company were to determine that its recorded tax liabilities were understated  an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
conversely  should the company determine that its deferred tax liabilities are in excess of its actual liability  an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
in fiscal  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million to reduce its deferred tax assets and believes the recorded deferred tax liability is adequate 
the company had net goodwill in the amount of million at january  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed an impairment test  which resulted in no impairment being identified 
the company is involved in litigation  claims and assessments incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these matters 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of claims 
when appropriate  such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability may change 
factors affecting future performance the company s continued success depends  in part  upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations  to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth 
future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability are difficult to predict 
the company s future performance is subject to risks and uncertainties that include  without limitation  changes in economic trends  competitive pressures in the retail industry  obtaining acceptable store locations  timely introduction and customer acceptance of the company s merchandise offering  the company s ability to efficiently source and distribute products  the company s ability to realize expected operational and cost efficiencies from its distribution centers  the company s ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets  unseasonable weather trends  significant increases in the cost of fuel or utility services  changes in the level of consumer spending on  or preferences for  home related merchandise  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  changes in accounting rules and regulations  the company s ability to attract and retain the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies  international conflicts and political strife and the effects on the flow or price of merchandise from overseas  terrorist attacks and our nation s response thereto and the company s ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the company will be required to begin recognizing expense related to stock based compensation  and the impact on its reported earnings for the fiscal year will be significant 
in addition  the company s corporate headquarters  one of its distribution centers and a significant number of its stores are located in california  therefore  a downturn in the california economy or a major natural disaster could significantly affect the company s operating results and financial condition 

table of contents in addition to the above factors  the retail industry is highly seasonal 
the net sales of the company for the fourth holiday fiscal quarter are historically higher than each of the first three fiscal quarters 
the company has realized a significant portion of its profits in each fiscal year during the fourth fiscal quarter 
if intensified price competition  lower than anticipated consumer demand or other factors were to occur during the fourth fiscal quarter  the company s fiscal year results could be adversely affected 
for a more detailed discussion on risk factors see page herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the company has fixed and variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt were to rise basis points a change from the company s borrowing rate as of january   the company s results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
foreign currency risks the majority of purchase obligations outside of the united states of america into which the company enters are settled in us dollars  therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the cost of products purchased in international markets can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and significant exchange rate changes could have a material impact on future product costs 
the extent to which an increase in costs from foreign currency exchange rate changes will be able to be recovered in higher prices charged to customers is uncertain 
the company does not hedge against foreign currency risks
