our company and products are organized according to our four major operating groups the network signaling group  the switching solutions group  the communications software solutions group  and the iex contact center group 
these operating groups were created principally as a result of a product rebranding initiative and reorganization of management currently underway following our recent acquisitions of taqua  vocaldata and steleus 
first  our network signaling product line has become the network signaling group  second  our next generation product line has become the switching solutions group  third  a new communications software solutions group comprised of steleus products as well as certain of our existing business intelligence applications and other network element independent solution products that were formerly included in the network signaling product line was created  and fourth  our contact center product line has become the iex contact center group 
network signaling group formerly network signaling 
our network signaling group products help direct and control voice and data communications 
they enable carriers to control  establish and terminate calls 
they also enable carriers to offer intelligent services  which include any services other than the call or data transmission itself 
examples include familiar products such as voice messaging  toll free calls eg  calls  prepaid calling cards  text messaging and local number portability 
our network signaling group products include the tekelec eagle signaling application system  tekelec application server  tekelec signaling edge  the short message gateway  and the sip to ss gateway 
during the fourth quarter of  certain network signaling products  including sentinel  were combined with steleus resources to become the basis of our new communications software solutions group 
switching solutions group formerly next generation switching 
our switching solutions group products are focused primarily on creating and enhancing next generation voice switching products and services for both traditional tdm based and new packet based class  class  and wireless applications 
the switching portion of a network carries and routes the actual voice or data comprising a call 
the switching solutions group comprises our santera  taqua  and vocaldata switching solutions portfolio 
santera s portfolio of switching products and services allows network service providers to migrate their network infrastructure from circuit based technology to packet based technology 
circuit based switching is largely based upon the time division multiplexing or tdm protocol standard  in which the electronic signals carrying the voice message traverses the network following a dedicated path  or circuit  from one user to the other 
packet based switching  however  breaks down the voice message into packets 
these packets then individually traverse the network  often taking separate paths  and are then reassembled on the other side of the network prior to delivery to the recipient 
packet based switching may utilize one of many protocols  the most common of which are asynchronous transfer mode or atm and internet protocol or ip 
voice transported using the ip protocol is often referred to as voice over ip or voip 

table of contents over the last two years  a generally improving economy and improved capital market conditions contributed to a broad turnaround in the financial condition of many telecom equipment providers 
while wireline service providers generally continued to experience access line losses and flat to declining revenues  wireless service providers experienced strong subscriber growth and increased end user adoption of wireless data services and applications 
in order to improve their competitive position relative to their wireless competitors  and in order to lower operating costs  a number of the world s largest carriers  commonly referred to as tier carriers  or carriers that typically have operations in more than one country and own and operate their own physical networks  announced their intentions or definitive plans to implement packet switching technology  generally referred to as voice over internet protocol voip 
these factors combined to allow equipment suppliers focused on wireless infrastructure and voip infrastructure to perform particularly well 
dell oro  a market research firm specializing in ip telephony market data said revenues from ip telephony carrier equipment  including softswitches  media gateways  and hybrid media gateway softswitches  grew to billion in  a percent increase over dell oro noted that the top three vendors in  in order from one to three  were nortel  sonus networks inc and tekelec 
industry analysts are projecting that implementation of packet switching technology will increase again in our switching solutions group products include santera s product portfolio consisting of the tekelec mgc and the tekelec mg  a carrier grade  integrated voice and data switching solutions which delivers applications like ixc tandem  class  pri offload  packet cell switching and voice over broadband services 
taqua s product portfolio  included in the switching solutions group  includes the tekelec aps  tekelec lag  and tekelec c vocaldata s ip centrex application server is being integrated into the switching solutions group business unit 
communications software solutions group 
our communications software products and services provide intelligent network services such as calling name  outbound call management  inbound call management and a service creation environment 
our products also enable intelligent network services such as revenue assurance  monitoring  network optimization  quality of service and marketing intelligence applications 
the communications software solutions group is comprised of steleus products as well as certain existing business intelligence applications and other products that were formally included in the network signaling group product line 
iex contact center group formerly contact center 
our iex contact center group provides workforce management and intelligent call routing systems for single and multiple site contact centers 
we sell our products primarily to customers in industries with significant contact center operations such as financial services  telecommunications and retail 
our iex contact center product line includes the totalview workforce management 
our revenues are currently organized into four distinct geographical territories north america  emea  cala and asia pacific 
north america is comprised of the united states and canada 
emea is comprised of europe  the middle east and africa 
cala is comprised of the caribbean and latin america including mexico 
asia pacific is comprised of asia and the pacific region including china 
in august  we completed the sale of our network diagnostics division ndd to catapult communications corporation catapult for million  consisting of million in cash and convertible subordinated promissory notes issued by catapult s wholly owned irish subsidiary and guaranteed by catapult in the total amount of million  subject to certain adjustments 
the sale of ndd resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million million after income taxes and was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly our historical financial results have been revised to reflect ndd as a discontinued operation 
during the third quarter of  an additional million gain on the sale of ndd was recognized based on post closing adjustments  including working capital  resulting from the final settlement with catapult in accordance with the asset purchase agreement 
in september  the notes matured and we exercised the conversion option of the notes into million shares of catapult common stock at the conversion rate of 
table of contents shares of catapult common stock per  principal 
in september  we sold our catapult shares resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million 
in april  we completed our acquisition of taqua  inc  a privately held provider of next generation packet switching systems  located in richardson  texas 
see note b acquisitions 
taqua offers a portfolio of circuit and ip voice switching products and services  including next generation packet class switches  intelligent line access gateways  application servers  and an element management system 
in addition  taqua offers a suite of professional services including network design and capacity planning  as well as installation and cutover services 
taqua products became part of our switching solutions group in the second quarter of in september  we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of privately held vocaldata 
see note b acquisitions vocaldata is a provider of hosted internet protocol ip telephony applications that enable the delivery of advanced telecom services and applications to business and residential customers 
as a result of the acquisition  vocaldata is the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of tekelec 
following our acquisition of vocaldata  its products became part of our switching solutions group 
in october  we completed the acquisition of steleus group inc steleus  a real time performance management company that supplies network related intelligence to telecommunications operators see note b acquisitions 
steleus was combined with certain existing tekelec sentinel and other business intelligence applications  such as billing verification  and other network element independent applications during the fourth quarter of to form our new communications software solutions group 
the acquisition represented our ongoing strategy to offer more value added applications to our customers and to further enhance and differentiate our switching products and services and signaling product offerings 
steleus products enable operators to monitor their service and network performance as they transition from circuit to packet technology  helping to speed up the implementation of packet networks  while lowering the risk 
they also enable operators to access critical business data such as call volumes  subscriber behavior and traffic types and volumes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates are evaluated  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  impairment of investments  notes receivable  deferred taxes and impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  product warranty  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
revenues are derived from sales of network signaling  contact center  switching solutions and communications software solutions products and services 
revenues are recognized upon the transfer of title  generally at the time of shipment to the customer s final site and satisfaction of related company obligations  if any  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is deemed probable 
for certain products  our sales arrangements include acceptance provisions which are based on our published specifications 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of these products assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided that we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria and has established a history with substantially similar transactions 
revenue is 
table of contents deferred for sales arrangements that include customer specific acceptance provisions where we are unable to reliably demonstrate that the delivered product meets all of the specified criteria until customer acceptance is obtained 
revenues associated with multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenues associated with installation services  if provided  are deferred based on the fair value of such services and are recognized upon completion 
revenue is recognized for extended warranty and maintenance agreements ratably over the contract term 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventory levels are based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can result in excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis inventories are reviewed and written down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimates could be influenced by sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn  rapid product improvements and technological changes 
investments 
our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are accounted for at their fair value  and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
among other things  we consider the duration and extent of the decline and economic factors influencing the markets 
to date  we have had no such other than temporary declines below cost basis 
at december  and  net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities were not significant 
we utilize specific identification in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
realized gains and losses are reported in other income and expense  and were not significant for  and we also invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are classified as long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operations 
we periodically review these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value and write down investments to their fair value when an other than temporary decline has occurred 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based on several factors including  the values for recent rounds of financing  quoted market prices for comparable public companies or market values for recent acquisitions of similar private companies  and pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information 
to date  there have been no impairments of investments in privately held companies 
convertible notes receivable 
as a result of the sale of our ndd business to catapult communications  inc in august  we recognized a receivable at the estimated fair value determined with the assistance of a third party appraisal 
the fair value was computed by discounting the face value amount to present value using a fair value rate of interest and then determining the fair value of the conversion 
table of contents option using the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value was amortized to the redemption value as of the date of maturity 
see note c disposition of network diagnostics business 
deferred taxes 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have provided an million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of santera  due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and realization of the benefits from santera s tax attributes in future tax returns 
realization of the remaining deferred tax assets of million is dependent on the amount of our income in carryback years and on our generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
should it be determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid to the fair value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identifiable intangible assets impact future amortization and the amounts assigned to ipr d are expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
instead  goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually thereafter 
in connection with our performance of the impairment tests  we obtained valuations of our individual reporting units from an independent third party valuation firm 
the valuation methodologies included  but were not limited to  estimated net present value of the projected cash flows of these reporting units 
as a result of these impairment tests  we determined that there was no goodwill impairment in or if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these valuations  or if market discount rates increase  this could adversely affect our future valuations and result in future impairment charges 
we assess potential impairment of our finite lived  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using discounted estimated future cash flows 
the amount of impairment would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
events or changes in circumstances which may cause impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
product warranty 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for one year after sale and provide for estimated future warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
leases 
at the time a lease is entered  we determine the classification of the lease as either a capital lease or an operating lease based on the factors listed in sfas our lease terms generally range from one month to ten years with rent expense recorded on a straight line basis for financial reporting 
we include all applicable rent escalations and abatements in our deferred rent amortization 
all of our operating leases are for a fixed period of time with pre determined rent escalations 

table of contents leasehold improvements 
if  at any time during our tenancy  we elect to construct or otherwise invest in leasehold improvements to the property  we capitalize the improvements 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement  or the original lease term 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the revenues by geographic territory as a percentage of total revenues percentage of revenues for the years ended december  north america europe  middle east and africa caribbean and latin america asia pacific total compared with revenues 
our revenues increased by million  or  during due primarily to the increased sales of million from our network signaling group and due secondarily to additional sales of million from the switching solutions group 
revenues from network signaling products and services increased by million  or  due mainly to increased sales of eagle stp upgrades and extensions of million and to million increased sales of eagle stp initial systems 
revenues from switching solutions products for increased million  reflecting the addition of sales of switching solutions products for the full year in compared to six months in following the acquisition of a majority interest in santera in june of  million in sales of taqua products and services following the april acquisition of taqua and million in sales of vocaldata products and services following the september acquisition of vocaldata 
see note b acquisitions 
revenues from contact center products increased by million  or  as a result of increased sales of million from the totalview product and an increase of million from totalview service contracts partially offset by lower sales of totalnet product and services 
revenues in north america increased by million  or  due primarily to a million increase in revenues from stp products and services and secondarily to a million increase in sales of our santera switching products 
revenues in the emea region increased by million  or  due primarily to an million increase in sales of eagle stp products and secondarily to the addition of steleus revenues of million 
cala region s revenues increased million  or  due primarily to million in higher sales of stp products 
revenues in the asia pacific region increased million  or  due primarily to a million increase in sales of stp products and services and secondarily to increased sales of santera of million 
we believe that our future revenue growth depends in large part upon a number of factors affecting the demand for our signaling and switching products 
regarding our signaling products  domestically  we derive the majority of our signaling revenue from wireless operators  as wireless networks generate significantly more signaling traffic than wireline networks and  as a result  require significantly more signaling infrastructure 
factors that increase the amount of signaling traffic generated on a wireless network  that we believe result in increased demand for our signaling products include  the growth in the number of subscribers  the number of calls made per subscriber  roaming  and the use of advance features  such as text messaging 
internationally  in addition to the factors affecting our domestic sales growth described above  eagle signaling product revenue growth depends on our ability to successfully penetrate new international markets  which often involves displacing an incumbent signaling vendor  and our ongoing ability to meet the signaling requirements of the newly acquired customers 
regarding our switching products  future revenue growth  both domestically and internationally  depends on the increasing adoption and deployment of packet switching technology 
as a result of the expansion of our product portfolio and our strategy of providing our customers with integrated 
table of contents products and services  the way that we recognize revenues in the future may be impacted 
in the event that we sell integrated products and service that we cannot separate into multiple elements due to the inability to establish vendor specific objective evidence  we will not be able to recognize revenue until all of the products and services are completely delivered 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to in compared with in in  the percentage of network signaling revenue decreased as a percentage of the total revenue from in to in network signaling margins are typically higher than the other operating segments 
changes in the following factors  among others  may affect gross profit product and distribution channel mix  competition  customer discounts  supply and demand conditions in the electronic components industry  internal manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies  foreign currency fluctuations  pricing pressure as we expand internationally  and general economic conditions 
we believe that as our product revenue mix will change to include a higher proportion of our lower margin switching solutions products and our geographic revenue mix may change to include a higher proportion of lower margin international business 
if such change or changes occur  our overall margins may decline 
pricing competition in the voip space has been intense and we believe the competitive environment will impact our margins in the next generation switching business 
in the international markets  we face similar competitive pressures which may also cause a decline in the overall margins 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased overall by million  or  and decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in these dollar increases were due primarily to an increase in salary and related expenses attributable to increases in personnel following our acquisition of a majority interest in santera  our april acquisition of taqua  our september acquisition of vocaldata  and our october acquisition of steleus see note b acquisitions 
we intend to continue to make substantial investments in product and technology development  and we believe that our future success depends in a large part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and to develop or acquire new products that maintain our technological competitiveness 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  and decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the increases were due primarily to additional costs related to our june acquisition of a majority interest in santera  our april acquisition of taqua and our september acquisition of vocaldata see note b acquisitions and secondarily to an increase in commission expense due to an increase in sales 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development iprd represents the amount of iprd determined with the assistance of a third party appraiser as part of the purchase price allocation for each acquired entity 
iprd was valued using a discounted cash flow approach commonly known as the excess earnings approach 
iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was written off at the time of acquisition 
iprd expense of million represents the write off of million of acquired iprd related to our taqua acquisition  million related to our acquisition of vocaldata and million related to our acquisition of steleus 
acquired iprd expense of million in represents the write off of iprd related to our acquisition of majority interest in santera see note b acquisitions 
restructuring charges 
in january  we announced a cost reduction initiative that resulted in restructuring charges of million for  including  in termination costs   in retention bonuses  and  in relocation costs 
these charges relate to our implementation of a global strategic manufacturing plan which includes outsourcing substantially all of our manufacturing operations and relocating our remaining signaling product manufacturing operations from calabasas  california to our facilities in morrisville  north carolina 
during  approximately positions were eliminated as a result of this restructure 
additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred into the first half of  as a result of these actions and will relate to general corporate expenses see note d restructuring costs 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets in increased by  to million 
this increase was due to the increase in intangible assets related to our acquisitions of taqua  vocaldata and steleus see note b acquisitions 
interest income and expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  due to the june issuance of our new convertible debt which carries a yield to maturity at issue of compared to the former convertible debt yield to maturity at issue of 
the former convertible debt was redeemed in july interest income decreased by million  or  due to lower cash balances due to our recent acquisitions of taqua  vocaldata and steleus and additional capital contributions to santera see note b acquisitions and to lower interest rates in compared to gain on sale of catapult stock 
in we sold our ndd division to catapult communications corporation catapult for million consisting million in cash and convertible promissory notes notes valued at million 
we exercised our option to convert the notes into catapult common stock in september the conversion rate was shares of catapult common stock per  in principal based on the original conversion agreement 
in september  we sold our catapult shares resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million 
gain on sale of investment in privately held company 
in august following the acquisition of telica by lucent technologies inc lucent  we received freely tradable common stock of lucent in exchange for our investment in telica  resulting in a pre tax gain of million  which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the million pre tax gain reflects an adjustment made in the fourth quarter ended december  for a million pre tax decrease in the gain on sale of investment in privately held company recorded in the third quarter ended september  the adjustment relates to  shares held in escrow  which were incorrectly marked to fair value  included in short term investments  and included as part of the gain that was recognized in the quarter ended september  as these shares are considered contingently issuable  they should not have been so recognized  and we have recorded a reduction in the gain of million  a reduction in short term investments of million  and the elimination of the related tax effects of  in the quarter ended december  these adjustments are reflected in the financial statements 
in september  we sold million of our shares of lucent stock for proceeds of approximately million 
we can receive up to an additional  shares of lucent stock held in escrow pending the resolution of acquisition related indemnifications made by telica to lucent 
the shares are anticipated to be released from escrow beginning months from the acquisition date 
we may recognize additional gains when and if these shares are released from escrow 
gain on warrants in privately held company 
in december  following the acquisition of spatial communications technologies spatial by alcatel  santera  our majority owned subsidiary  exercised warrants convertible into  shares of freely tradable alcatel shares valued at per share 
as a result of this transaction  santera recognized a gain of million which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the alcatel shares are included in short term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we can receive up to an additional  shares of alcatel held in escrow pending the resolution of acquisition related indemnifications made by spatial to alcatel 
the shares are anticipated to be released from escrow beginning months from the acquisition date 
we may recognize additional gains when and if these shares are released from escrow 
provision for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes for and were million and million  respectively  and reflected the effect of non deductible acquisition related costs and amortization  partially offset by a benefit of million and million  respectively  from the utilization of deferred tax liabilities related to certain of these acquisition related costs 
our provision for income taxes does not include any benefit from the losses generated by santera because it s losses cannot be included on our consolidated federal tax return inasmuch as our ownership interest in santera does not meet the threshold to consolidate under income tax rules and regulations  and a full valuation allowance has been established against santera s deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and realization of the benefits from 
table of contents santera s tax attributes in future tax returns 
our effective tax rate was for and for and includes in and in relating to acquisition related items and the results of santera 
excluding the effect of these acquisition related items and the operating results of santera  our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively  and represented federal  state and foreign taxes on our income  reduced primarily by research and development credits  foreign tax credits and other benefits from foreign sourced income 
we expect that our effective tax rate  excluding the effect of acquisition related items and the operating results of santera  will remain relatively consistent with and within the range of the effective tax rates in prior years 
changes in the tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of international sales and changes in the amount of the research and development and other credits 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the losses of santera allocable to santera s minority stockholders 
the net income and losses of santera are allocated between tekelec and the minority interest based on their relative interests in the equity of santera and the related liquidation preferences 
this approach requires net losses to be allocated first to the series a preferred stock until fully absorbed and then to the series b preferred stock 
subsequent net income will be allocated first to the series b preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized net losses allocated to series b preferred stock 
additional net income will then be allocated to the series a preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized losses allocated to series a preferred stock and then to common stock in proportion to their relative ownership interests in the equity of santera 
the loss allocated to minority interest of santera for was computed as follows dollars in thousands santera net loss includes amortization of intangibles of  percentage of losses attributable to the minority interest based on capital structure and liquidation preferences net loss allocated to minority interest net income 
net income of million for the year ended was comprised mainly of net operating income of million as a result of increased sales in as compared to of million  partially offset by increased operating expense in as compared to resulting from our acquisitions of santera  taqua  vocaldata and steleus  the add back of the losses attributed to the minority interest of santera of million and gains on investments of privately held companies of million 
compared with revenues 
our revenues increased by million  or  during due to the addition of million of sales from our switching solutions products partially offset by lower sales in both our network signaling and contact center operating segments 
revenues from switching solutions products for were million  reflecting the addition of sales of next generation products following our june acquisition of a majority interest in santera 
see note b acquisitions 
revenues from network signaling products decreased by million  or  due primarily to lower sales of million from eagle stp products  partially offset by million of higher revenues from service agreements 
eagle stp product sales decreased in as a result of customers increasing the capacity of their existing stp nodes by purchasing extensions rather than initial systems 
revenues from contact center products decreased by million  or  primarily as a result of million in decreased sales of totalview product and services 
the decrease in the revenues was attributable primarily to a reduction in information technology capital spending and increasing competition in the industry 
revenues from sentinel products  which became a part of our software solutions group as a result of our acquisition of steleus in october  decreased by million  or in we have reclassified the financial results related to these products to the communications software solutions group 

table of contents revenues in north america increased by million  or  due primarily to increased revenues of million from upgrades  extension sales and revenues from service agreements offset partially by million of lower eagle stp initial systems sales 
revenues in the emea region decreased by million  or  due primarily to a decrease in sales of eagle stp products partially offset by higher network signaling maintenance revenue 
the cala and asia pacific regions revenue increased by million  or  due primarily to an increase in sales of our eagle stp products 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared with in the increase in gross margins was due primarily to a higher proportion of sales of eagle stp upgrades and extensions and service agreements  which typically carry higher margins 
sales of eagle stp upgrades and extensions and service agreements were approximately of network signaling revenues in as compared to  in research and development 
research and development expenses increased overall by million  or  and increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in these increases were due primarily to an million of increase in salary and related expenses attributable to additional personnel and our acquisition of a majority interest in santera see note b acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  and increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the increases were due primarily to the inclusion of santera s selling  general and administrative expense following our acquisition of a majority interest in santera see note b acquisitions  which accounted for an million increase  offset by a million reduction of variable compensation costs

our provision for income taxes does not include any benefit from the losses generated by santera due to the following santera s losses cannot be included on our consolidated federal tax return because our ownership interest in santera does not meet the threshold to consolidate under income tax rules and regulations  and a full valuation allowance has been established against santera s deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and realization of the benefits from santera s tax attributes in future tax returns

minority interest 
minority interest represents the losses of santera allocable to santera s minority stockholders 
the net income and losses of santera are allocated between tekelec and the minority interest based on their relative interests in the equity of santera and the related liquidation preferences 
this approach requires net losses to be allocated first to the series a preferred stock until fully absorbed and then to the series b preferred stock 
subsequent net income will be allocated first to the series b preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized net losses allocated to series b preferred stock 
additional net income will then be allocated to the series a preferred stock to the extent of previously recognized losses allocated to series a preferred stock and then to common stock in proportion to their relative ownership interests in the equity of santera 
the loss allocated to minority interest of santera for the period of june  through december  was computed as follows dollars in thousands santera net loss includes amortization of intangibles and iprd charges of  and  respectively percentage of losses attributable to the minority interest based on capital structure and liquidation preferences net loss allocated to minority interest loss from discontinued operation 
there was no income or loss recorded in relating to our discontinued operation compared to a loss from discontinued operation of million for gain on disposal of discontinued operation 
gain on disposal of our discontinued operation represents the gain recognized  net of income taxes  on the sale of the network diagnostics division sold in august as discussed above in the overview section 
in  we recognized a gain of million as a result of the final resolution of contingencies under the sale agreement 
net income 
net income of million for the year ended was comprised mainly of a net operating loss of million as a result of increased operating expense in primarily resulting from our june acquisition of a majority interest in santera  offset by the losses attributed to the minority interest of santera of million and a gain on the sale of ndd of million 
liquidity and capital resources during  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million 
operating activities  net of the effects of exchange rate changes on cash  provided million  compared to million in and million in primarily as a result of changes in working capital 
cash flows from operating activities were comprised mainly of net income adjusted for minority interest  the gains on the warrants in and sale of our investments in privately held companies  depreciation and amortization  and increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
accounts receivable increased during due primarily to the increase in sales in compared to and secondarily to the addition of receivables from the three acquisitions in the net accounts receivable amounts for these acquisitions were approximately million at december  deferred revenue increased by in compared to due primarily to an increase in revenue not recognizable for transactions with acceptance or delivery requirements that had not been completed 
in  cash flows from operations were impacted by similar changes in working capital as noted above 
investing activities used million and was comprised primarily of million used in the acquisition of taqua  vocaldata and steleus  net of million provided from the sales of privately held companies and catapult stock and million in net proceeds derived from the sale of short term and long term investments and million for capital expenditures in cash used in investing activities in was million and included net purchases of investments of million offset by million of proceeds from the sale of ndd

table of contents purchase of investments of million and net purchases of property and equipment of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of ndd 
financing activities provided million in compared to a use of million in which was a result of approximately million used to replace our higher yield to maturity convertible debt with lower yield to maturity convertible debt offset by million related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
financing activities provided million from the issuance of common stock in on october   we completed the acquisition of steleus group inc steleus 
we paid cash in the aggregate amount of approximately million for of steleus outstanding stock 
in addition  we have incurred approximately million in direct acquisition related costs 
in september and april of we completed our acquisitions of vocaldata and taqua with cash consideration of million and million  respectively 
under terms of the original santera purchase agreement  during we made additional cash investments in santera aggregating million in exchange for  shares of santera series b preferred stock 
as a result of our million cash investment  our ownership percentage increased to on an as converted basis 
in addition to this million additional investment  we have funded substantially all of santera s operating losses and working capital requirements since the acquisition 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the capital structure of santera has been eliminated in consolidation and the minority stockholders interest in santera is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as minority interest 
the minority stockholders interest in santera is reflected at the fair value of the santera assets on the date of acquisition 
see note b acquisitions 
we have funded and expect to continue to fund the operations of santera  taqua  vocaldata  and steleus throughout we believe that our historical sources of cash like existing working capital  funds generated through operations  proceeds from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of options  and our current bank credit facility will be sufficient to offset the uses of cash from our recent acquisitions and to satisfy operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
nonetheless  we may seek additional sources of capital as necessary or appropriate to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations  however  there can be no assurance that such funds  if needed  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we have a number of credit facilities with various financial institutions 
as of december  we had a million line of credit which was collateralized by a stock pledge of our holdings in santera  bore interest at or  in some cases  below the lender s prime rate at december   which expired on february  there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
the commitment fees paid on the unused line of credit were not significant 
in december  we secured a million line of credit collateralized by a pledged account where our investments are held with an intermediary financial institution 
this line is intended to replace our million line that expired in february 
the new credit facility bears interest at  or in some cases below  the lender s prime rate at december   and expires on december   if not renewed 
in the event that we borrow against this line  we will maintain collateral in the amount of the borrowing in the pledged account 
there have been no borrowings under this facility 
the commitment fees paid on the unused line of credit were not significant 
under the terms of each of these credit facilities  we are required to maintain certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenant requirements as of december  as of december   santera had two notes payable one note had an outstanding balance of  and was collateralized by the assets purchased thereunder  bore interest at and was paid in full upon maturity in february  the second note for million was collateralized by the assets purchased under the note and substantially all of santera s assets  excluding the assets collaterized under the  note  bears interest at  and matures in november taqua has a million credit facility  which is collateralized by substantially all assets of taqua  inc  bears interest at above the lenders prime rate at december  and expires in april under the terms of each of these credit facilities  we are required to maintain certain financial covenants 
we are in compliance with these covenant requirements as of december   except for the taqua facility 
taqua was not in compliance with these covenants as of december   due to the failure of taqua to meet certain financial reporting requirements to the 
table of contents financial institution 
as a result of our acquisition of taqua  the line will not be renewed upon expiration and taqua s financing needs will be met with our new consolidated credit facility 
there are no outstanding borrowings on the taqua facility 
in june  we completed the private placement of million principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes notes due in there are no financial covenants related to the notes and there are no restrictions on us paying dividends  incurring debt or issuing or repurchasing securities 
following the issuance of the notes in  we called our previously issued convertible subordinated discounted notes 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
less than more than total year years years years in thousands notes payable long term convertible debt interest due on long term convertible debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total from time to time in the normal course of business we may enter into purchasing agreements with our suppliers that require us to accept delivery of  and remit full payment for  finished products that we have ordered  finished products that we requested be held as safety stock  and work in process started on our behalf in the event we cancel or terminate the purchasing agreement 
it is not our intent  nor is it reasonably likely  that we would cancel a purchase order which we have executed 
because these agreements do not specify fixed or minimum quantities  do not specify minimum or variable price provisions  and do not specify the approximate timing of the transaction  we have no basis to estimate any future liability 
we lease a number of facilities throughout the united states and internationally under operating leases that range from one month to ten years 
we believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our needs at least through  and that we will be able to obtain additional space when  where and as needed on acceptable terms 
our steleus subsidiary leases office equipment in france under two capital leases that are in effect through july and july and require minimum lease payments of  in and  in litigation with bouygues telecom as further described in item legal proceedings  bouygues telecom  sa  a french telecommunications operator filed a legal complaint against us seeking damages for economic losses caused by a service interruption bouygues telecom experienced

table of contents financial risk we conduct business in a number of foreign countries  with certain transactions denominated in local currencies  principally euros and british pounds 
in certain instances where we have entered into contracts that are denominated in foreign currencies  we have obtained foreign currency forward contracts to offset the impact of currency rate fluctuations on accounts receivable 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recorded immediately in earnings 
as of december   we had three foreign currency forward contracts outstanding  explained in more detail in note i  which did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements 
as of december   we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to sell approximately  euros in order to hedge certain receivables denominated in that currency 
this contract had an expiration date of january  and did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements 
we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the purpose of our foreign currency management policy is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign denominated anticipated cash flows

credit losses for such customers have been provided for in the financial statements 
future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
