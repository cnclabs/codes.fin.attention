item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company s operations are conducted through its operating subsidiaries 
its two primary operating subsidiaries  kinro  inc and its subsidiaries kinro and lippert components  inc and its subsidiaries lippert have operations in both the mh and rv segments 
at december   the company s subsidiaries operated plants in the united states and one in canada 
the rv segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for the rv segment manufactures a variety of products used in the production of recreational vehicles  including windows  doors  chassis  chassis parts  slide out mechanisms and related power units  and electric stabilizer jacks 
the rv segment also manufactures specialty trailers for equipment hauling  boats  personal watercraft and snowmobiles 
the company s rv products are used primarily in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in  up from percent in in recent months  the company has begun to focus its efforts on expanding its market share for products used in motorhomes  and began selling slide out mechanisms for motorhomes in the second quarter of the company is also introducing leveling devices  axles  steps and bath products for rvs 
the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for  manufactures a variety of products used in the construction of manufactured homes  and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens  chassis  chassis parts and thermo formed bath and shower units 
on may   the company acquired california based zieman manufacturing company zieman 
zieman is a manufacturer of specialty trailers for equipment hauling  boats  personal watercraft and snowmobiles  and chassis and chassis parts for towable recreational vehicles and manufactured homes 
the purchase price was million  plus million of zieman s debt which the company assumed 
the purchase price was funded with borrowings under the company s credit agreement 
zieman had plants in states in the western united states 
the results of the acquired zieman business have been included in the company s consolidated statement of income beginning may  zieman s sales for its fiscal year ended december  were approximately million  and for the year ended december  zieman s sales were million  including million subsequent to its acquisition by the company 
in  zieman had approximately million in sales of rv chassis and chassis parts  approximately million in sales of marine and leisure trailers and million of mh chassis and chassis parts 
the operations of zieman are being integrated with those of lippert 
the production processes and raw materials used by zieman are substantially similar to those of lippert  and it is expected that the operating margins achieved by this newly acquired business will  over time  approximate those achieved by lippert 
until the second quarter of  the company s rv segment included only recreational vehicle products  however  with the company s acquisition of zieman  the specialty trailer business of zieman has been added to the rv segment 
other than sales of specialty trailers  which aggregated approximately million in  sales to industries other than manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes are not significant 
intersegment sales are insignificant 
industry background recreational vehicle industry the recreational vehicle industrial association rvia reported a percent increase in total industry shipments  to  rvs in  from  in shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary market  increased percent in it has been reported by analysts that industry wide shipments included approximately  travel trailers  consisting of only the essential components  purchased by the federal emergency management agency fema to provide emergency housing to hurricane victims in the southeastern united states 
it is not expected that these units will be resold to traditional rv consumers 
without the fema units  the increase in industry shipments would have been 
the rvia is projecting a decline in wholesale shipments of all types of rvs in  but they are forecasting that shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs will be approximately the same as in in the long term  increasing industry rv sales are expected to continue to be driven by positive demographics  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the population 
according to us census bureau projections  years from now there will be in excess of million more people over the age of industry growth also continues to be bolstered by the preference for domestic vacations  rather than foreign travel  and low interest rates 
in recent years  the rvia has employed an advertising campaign to attract customers in the to age group  and the number of rv s owned by those to grew faster than all other age groups 
manufactured housing industry as a result of i limited credit availability for purchases of manufactured homes  ii high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages on site built homes and chattel loans for manufactured homes chattel loans have been used to finance approximately percent of manufactured homes purchased this year  and iii unusually high repossessions of manufactured homes  industry production declined approximately percent since  to  homes in  the lowest production level in years 
however  based upon industry reports  retail sales of manufactured homes have declined much less severely than industry production in recent years 
almost percent of retail sales in the last several years have been filled by inventory reductions by dealers and manufacturers  and the resale of repossessed homes  rather than new production 
it has been estimated that approximately  to  manufactured homes were repossessed in each of  and  far in excess of historical repossession levels 
it has been reported that the level of repossessions of manufactured homes has declined to between  and  homes this year 
the manufactured housing institute mhi reported that industry wholesale shipments of manufactured homes remained at  in  as a result of a percent increase in wholesale shipments during the fourth quarter of  from the comparable period in the increase in wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter of was largely due to the shipment of  to  manufactured homes ordered by fema to provide emergency housing to hurricane victims in the southeastern united states 
these houses are not expected to be resold by fema 
the availability of financing for manufactured homes has apparently improved somewhat in recent months  and is expected to improve further  partially as a result of the entry of several lenders into the market 
in addition  in september berkshire hathaway inc acquired clayton homes and oakwood homes  two of the leading producers of manufactured homes  as well as st mortgage 
since then  berkshire has helped clayton raise substantial funds for its mortgage operations 
further  as noted above  the level of repossessions of manufactured homes has reportedly declined this year 
long term prospects for manufactured housing are favorable because manufactured homes provide quality  affordable housing 
steel prices steel is one of the company s primary raw materials in both segments  representing about percent of the company s raw material costs 
in mid december and continuing into  the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases 
the prices the company pays for steel  depending on the type of steel purchased  are currently double to triple the levels they were a year ago 
to offset the impact of higher steel costs  estimated to be million  the company implemented surcharges and sales price increases to its customers 
the company estimates that substantially all steel cost increases received through the end of were passed on to customers by early however  unrecovered steel cost increases reduced net income in the second half of by between million and million 
the company does not expect to earn additional profit from the sales price increases implemented in response to rising steel costs 
as a result  the company s material cost as a percent of sales has increased  particularly for products which are made primarily from steel 
however  if steel costs remain stable  the steel cost increases experienced in are not expected to have a significant effect on operating profit in because they will be substantially offset by the sales price increases which have been implemented  the last of which took effect in early while the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset raw material cost increases  there are no assurances that future raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of sales price increases 
the aggregate cost of the company s inventories of steel has increased substantially because of the steel cost increases and higher quantities of steel on hand due to the increase in sales volume 
the company also experienced significant cost increases in several of its other raw materials  which were also largely passed on to customers by early results of operations net sales and operating profit are as follows in thousands year ended december  net sales rv segment    mh segment    total    operating profit rv segment    mh segment    amortization of intangibles  corporate and other    other income total    net sales and operating profit by segment  as a percent of the total  are as follows year ended december  net sales rv segment mh segment total operating profit rv segment mh segment amortization of intangibles corporate and other other income total year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights on may   the company completed the acquisition of california based zieman manufacturing company zieman  a manufacturer of a variety of specialty trailers trailers for equipment hauling  boats  personal watercraft and snowmobiles  and chassis and chassis parts for rvs and manufactured homes  with sales of approximately million in the acquisition was immediately accretive to the company s earnings per share  adding approximately 
per share in the eight months since it was acquired 
net sales for were up percent compared to  or more than percent excluding sales price increases and the acquisition of zieman 
net income for  of million  was percent higher than in net income did not increase as rapidly as net sales for several reasons  including sales price increases did not fully offset the increases in the cost of steel and other raw material used by the company 
with additional sales price increases implemented in early  substantially all increases in raw material costs experienced in have been passed on to customers 
the company did not earn any additional profit from the sales price increases which have been implemented  which caused the profit margin to decline 
the company recorded a charge of million  after taxes and the direct impact on incentive compensation related to an adverse jury verdict related to a workplace injury 
the company intends to move for a new trial or appeal the verdict based on the advice of counsel that the verdict is unsupported by the evidence 
costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act were approximately million before taxes  without considering management time  which reduced net income by approximately  for it is anticipated that these costs may be slightly less in during  drew s lippert subsidiary implemented plans to close six profitable  but underperforming factories 
the production at these factories will now be absorbed by nearby lippert factories 
the anticipated savings from consolidating production will more than offset the charge of   after taxes and the direct impact on incentive compensation in relating to plant closings 
net sales of the company s mh segment increased percent in  or more than excluding sales price increases and the acquisition of zieman  compared to  while industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes in were the same as in rv segment net sales of the rv segment increased percent to million in excluding net sales of newly acquired zieman and sales price increases approximately million  organic sales growth of this segment was approximately percent compared to  significantly greater than the percent industry wide increase in shipments of rvs this year 
the organic sales growth of the rv segment included an increase of million  or nearly percent  in sales of slide out mechanisms and related power units 
the company now has a very substantial share of the market for slide out mechanisms for towable rvs  and expects future growth in sales of its slide out products to come largely from slide out products for motorhomes  which the company began selling in the second quarter of the rv segment results for included sales by newly acquired zieman in the eight months since its acquisition of approximately million of rv chassis and chassis parts and more than million of specialty trailers 
operating results of the specialty trailers business are included in the rv segment 
the company intends to expand zieman s specialty trailer business from the west coast  where zieman now operates  to the central united states 
operating profit of the rv segment increased percent to million in the operating profit margin of this segment declined to percent of sales in  from percent last year 
the decline in the operating profit margin of the rv segment resulted largely from continued increases in the price of steel  and to a lesser extent aluminum  not all of which were passed on to customers 
further  sales price increases generally covered cost increases only  and did not include profit margin 
in addition  facility impairment and lease termination charges aggregating  were recorded in this segment in  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter of the increase in raw material prices aggregated approximately million in the rv segment 
in response to these cost increases  the company significantly raised its sales prices on certain of its products during and early the company believes that  on a consolidated basis  sales price increases obtained in and early are adequate to offset substantially all increases in raw material costs experienced in excluding the impact of the sales price increases described above  labor and manufacturing overhead costs as a percent of sales remained stable in  compared to  as higher warranty and overtime costs offset the benefit of spreading of fixed production costs over a larger sales base 
the company has augmented its quality control effort to help minimize future warranty costs 
in  the company also increased its spending on research and development 
quality control costs and research and development costs are expected to increase further in mh segment net sales of the mh segment increased percent to million in excluding net sales by newly acquired zieman approximately million and sales price increases approximately million  organic sales growth of this segment in was approximately percent  compared to the flat industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes this year 
organic sales growth by this segment resulted primarily from market share gains 
in response to the substantial increases in the cost of steel described above  and to a lesser extent  aluminum  the company raised its sales prices on certain of its products 
the company believes that  on a consolidated basis  sales price increases obtained in and early are adequate to offset substantially all increases in raw material costs experienced in operating profit of the mh segment increased percent to million in the operating profit margin of this segment in declined to percent of sales  from percent in results of this segment for include a charge of million related to an adverse jury verdict related to a workplace injury 
the company intends to move for a new trial or appeal the verdict based on the advice of counsel that the verdict is unsupported by the evidence 
the operating profit margin of this segment in was favorably impacted by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base  however  this was partially offset by the inclusion of zieman s operations  which currently have lower margins than drew s other operations in the mh segment 
as of november   the company evaluated the fair value of the goodwill associated with the mh segment  which had a book value of million  and determined that no impairment had occurred 
the company will continue to monitor such goodwill in light of conditions in the mh industry 
corporate and other corporate and other expenses for increased million compared to  of which million is due to higher consulting  audit fees and other costs related to compliance with section of sarbanes oxley 
stock option expense increased approximately  and corporate office incentive compensation increased nearly  due to higher profit levels 
on a consolidated basis  stock option expense increased to  in  of which approximately  is included in segment results 
other income in february  the company sold certain intellectual property rights relating to a process used to manufacture a new composite material  and simultaneously entered into an equipment lease and a license agreement with the buyer 
the lease is still not effective  as the lessor has not yet provided operational equipment and tooling 
if operational equipment is properly installed  the company plans to use the new composite material to produce certain bath products for the manufactured housing  modular housing  and recreational vehicle industries on an exclusive  royalty free basis  to compete against fiberglass bath products in these industries 
the company will also have the right to use the new composite material on a royalty free  non exclusive basis to manufacture various other products for the manufactured housing  modular housing  and recreational vehicle industries 
the sale price for the intellectual property rights was million  consisting of cash of  at closing and a note of million  payable over five years 
the company had a minimal basis in the intellectual property sold 
in  the company received payments aggregating approximately 
million  and recorded a pre tax gain on sale of  the note bears interest at increasing annual interest rates  and is secured by a lien on the intellectual property rights sold  a right of offset against the lease  and a guaranty 
the note is convertible at the company s option into an equity interest in the new venture that the buyer has formed to promote this process 
additional gains  if any  will be recorded as payments on the million balance of the note are received 
in january  the company received a scheduled payment on the note of  plus interest 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights income from continuing operations was up percent in  to a record million 
operating profit margin increased to percent for  from percent in net sales grew by percent 
on october  the company completed the acquisition of indiana based et t frames  inc et t  a manufacturer of specialty chassis and towable rv chassis products with annual sales of approximately million  for million 
on july  the company completed the acquisition of kansas based ltm manufacturing  llc ltm  a manufacturer of innovative rv products with annual sales of approximately million  for million 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment increased million percent from  largely due to increases in the company s market share of all its primary rv product lines  including rv slide out mechanisms and related power units  chassis  and windows and doors 
sales of rv slide out mechanisms and related power units doubled from  to approximately million 
the growth of this segment also resulted from the industry wide growth in rv shipments  in particular the company s primary market of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  as well as the continued trend towards using more slide out mechanisms in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
there were no significant changes in sales prices by the company s rv segment in the acquisitions of ltm and et t  completed in  added only approximately million in sales in  but have substantial growth potential to exceed their combined pre acquisition annual historical sales of approximately million 
in the later part of  the company s research and development departments designed and developed new products such as leveling systems and slide out mechanisms for motor homes  and bath and shower units for rvs 
for  the company only had minimal sales to the motor home segment of the rv industry 
operating profit of the rv segment increased million percent in over this growth is attributable to both an increase in unit sales and an increase in the segment s operating profit margin 
operating profit margin increased to percent for from percent in primarily because of i the spreading of fixed costs over higher sales  ii greater purchasing leverage for certain components  iii improved operating efficiencies  and iv temporarily moderate steel costs during the middle of the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases which began in late and accelerated  as described in industry background above 
partially offsetting these increases in operating profit margin were legal and other costs related to the settlement of patent litigation on the company s slide out mechanisms in february and higher health and workers compensation insurance costs 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment declined million percent in  which was less of a decline than that experienced by the industry as a whole 
the company has captured market share and increased sales of products for modular homes and office units partially offsetting the sales reduction caused by the decline in industry shipments 
there were no significant changes in sales prices by the company s mh segment during operating profit of the mh segment decreased million percent in largely because of the decline in sales 
this segment s operating profit margin was percent of sales in  which was slightly lower than the percent achieved for  primarily because of higher health and workers compensation insurance costs and the negative impact of lower volume on fixed costs  partially offset by temporarily moderate steel costs during the middle of the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases which began in late and accelerated in  as described in industry background above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were down in dollar terms following the trend of sales 
as of november   the company evaluated the fair value of the goodwill associated with the mh segment  which had a book value of million  and determined that no impairment had occurred 
corporate and other corporate and other expenses increased  in  primarily as a result of higher directors and officers insurance costs  incentive compensation due to increased profits  stock option expense resulting from the adoption of sfas  expenses associated with the listing of the company s stock on the new york stock exchange  and expenses related to corporate governance due to the implementation of the sarbanes oxley requirements 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  for remained approximately the same as in  as lower debt levels early in the year were offset by higher debt resulting from both the acquisition of zieman on may   and higher working capital levels primarily for steel inventory and accounts receivable 
on october   the company entered into a five year interest rate swap with keybank national association with a notional amount of  from which it will receive periodic payments at the month libor rate plus the company s applicable spread and make periodic payments at a fixed rate of plus the company s applicable spread  with settlement and rate reset dates every november  february  may and august the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by  on each quarterly reset date beginning february  the fair value of the swap was zero at inception 
the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of certain borrowings under the credit agreement and recognized the effective portion of the change in fair value as part of other comprehensive income  with the ineffective portion recognized in earnings currently 
the fair value of this swap at december  was  net of a taxes of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was approximately  compared to in and in the increase in the effective tax rate in is due in part to a change in the composition of pre tax income for state tax purposes 
discontinued operations the axle and tire refurbishing business of lippert tire and axle lta did not perform well from through  primarily due to increased competition and the decline in the manufactured housing industry  which severely affected operating margins 
by january  the axle and tire business of lta had ceased operation 
as a result  the axle and tire refurbishing business is classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements pursuant to sfas no 
discontinued operations is presented net of tax expense benefit of  and  for the years ended december  and the proceeds from the disposition of all other significant assets of lta s axle and tire refurbishing business  consisting primarily of inventory and accounts receivable  were collected in january and resulted in a small gain 
the discontinued axle and tire refurbishing business had previously been included in the company s mh segment  and had revenues of million in recently adopted and new accounting standards as of april   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options contained in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is considered the preferable method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
during the transition period  the company is utilizing the prospective method under sfas no

this resulted in charges to operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  relating to options for  shares granted between and historically  the company had applied the disclosure only option of sfas no 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for stock options granted prior to january  had the company previously adopted this new accounting policy  diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by

the increase in days sales outstanding was partly due to the timing of collections 
in addition  the accounts receivable of newly acquired zieman have a longer collection cycle 
b inventories increased million during excluding the inventory obtained in the acquisition of zieman on may   of which approximately million is due to the increase in the cost of steel and other raw materials  and million is due to the increase in unit sales excluding zieman 
inventories have also increased because of the recent introduction of several new products 
higher inventory levels are required during the initial stages of product introductions 
the inventory increase is substantially all in raw materials  as there was less than a two week supply of finished goods on hand at december  c the increase in inventory was partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities during the increase in these liabilities was less than would be expected on a million increase in inventory  because inventories declined during the fourth quarter of  so that fourth quarter purchases  and therefore year end payables  were less than would otherwise be expected 
trade payables are generally paid within the discount period 
net cash flows from operating activities increased approximately million in  as a result of a million increase in income from continuing operations  as well as a a smaller increase in accounts receivable for the increase in accounts receivable was lower than  even though sales were higher in  due to a reduction in the days sales outstanding in receivables to approximately days 
this was due to the timing of collections 
b a decline in inventories for  excluding the effect of business acquisitions  compared to an increase in inventories in the decline in resulted from a concerted effort by management to reduce inventories at all locations  as well as strategic buying of certain raw materials at december  the inventory decrease is substantially all in raw materials  as there was only approximately a two week supply of finished goods on hand at december  and the impact of the rise in steel prices on inventory and the company s strategic buying of steel before the steel price increases took effect  did not impact inventory until c a decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets compared to an increase in the decline in was primarily due to the utilization of prepaid federal income taxes and an escrow deposit  both of which were uses of cash in d the above items were partially offset by a smaller increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
this change is primarily from the timing of payments and purchases at the end of trade payables are generally paid within the discount period

while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes the company s tax provision is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include certain deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require the judgment of management in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
stock options in  the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options as contained in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is considered the preferable method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
as a result  the fair value of all employee stock options granted after january  is being charged against earnings over the period of time during which the options vest 
to determine fair value  the company uses a method known as the black scholes option pricing method 
fair value is determined as of the date the option is granted 
the fair value of options granted before january  are not being charged against earnings since the company is using the prospective method  as allowed under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
if the company had charged compensation cost of options granted prior to january  to earnings  by using the modified prospective method under sfas no 
 net income loss would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net income loss  as reported    add stock based employee compensation expense for stock options included in reported net income loss  net of related tax effects deduct total stock based employee compensation expense for stock options determined under fair value method for all stock option awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income loss    net income loss per common share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business related to product returns  doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
inflation the prices of raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
in mid december and continuing into the second half of  the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases 
depending upon the type of steel purchased  steel costs are currently double or triple the levels they were prior to december steel costs appear to have stabilized and further cost increases are not projected for in  the company has also received cost increases from suppliers of aluminum  vinyl and abs resin 
the company experienced modest increases in its labor costs in and related to inflation

at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings of a similar nature subsequent to december   which the company becomes unable to capitalize on in the short term as a result of the structure of its fixed rate financing  future cash flows would be approximately  lower per annum than if the fixed rate financing could be obtained at current market rates 
at december   including borrowings of million on its credit agreement  the company had million of variable rate debt 
assuming there is an increase of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings under these variable rate loans subsequent to december   and outstanding borrowings of million  future cash flows would be affected by  per annum
