item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we have one operating segment  developing and publishing interactive entertainment software videogames 
videogames for play on home consoles  handheld devices or personal computers pcs are sold to mass merchants  video rental retailers  software specialty retailers and entertainment software distributors 
we sell games primarily in north america  europe and australia for the major videogame platforms  including sony s playstation computer entertainment system  microsoft s xbox and nintendo s gamecube and game boy advance 
most of our videogames have suggested retail prices on the initial release date ranging from to for console games and from to for handheld games 
suggested retail prices on the initial release dates for pc games are usually between and 
we have experienced annual operating losses since our fiscal year ended june  in order to address this issue  we have eliminated and consolidated some operations and hired new senior officers  including our new chief executive officer 
during the second half of  we refocused our product strategy to i build games for mature gamers  ii build over the top sports games and iii build games that leverage our proven intellectual properties and franchises 
recently  we also decided to re enter the pc game market and to expand our portfolio of children s products 
we are focusing our product development and marketing resources to build higher quality games with more marketing support than prior to we are attempting to structure our product release schedules and product launch timing to best position our products against their competition 
we also are increasing pre launch awareness and visibility of our games with consumers through increased spending on media advertising and retail marketing 
in addition  during and  we completed several financing transactions to support and execute our refocused strategy 
all of these efforts were designed to increase liquidity and reverse the trend of losses that we experienced in recent fiscal periods and to eventually return us to profitability 
as a result  losses have been reduced significantly in  and we experienced our first profitable quarter  the fourth quarter ended december   since fiscal new platform cycle the current generation of game platforms includes the following home consoles sony s playstation  released in  the nintendo gamecube and microsoft xbox  released in  and the nintendo handheld platform  game boy advance  introduced in historically  a new generation of more technologically advanced game consoles has reached the market approximately every four to six years 
at the beginning of each new generation  or cycle  during the period of rapid growth in the installed base of the new generation of consoles  software sales for the new consoles have historically experienced periods of rapid expansion  as buyers purchase videogames for the new consoles 
at the end of each cycle  when the introduction of a new generation of home game consoles is announced  sales of the older generation of platforms and games generally diminish  as consumers defer purchases in anticipation of the new platforms and games 
the time period referred to by the industry as the home console transition period is roughly defined as the time period from the introduction of the first new generation of home game consoles until these new consoles supplant the older generation consoles in terms of software sales 
microsoft announced that it will introduce a new home console platform by late the playstation from sony is not expected to be released until sometime in we are currently planning for this transition in our product development process 
in november  nintendo launched a dual screened  portable game system  nintendo ds 
sony also entered the handheld market with the introduction of playstation portable psp  a handheld platform 
psp was released in japan late in and sony currently plans to release this device in the united states in late march the handheld market is not currently a significant part of our business but we may devote more resources toward this market in the future contingent upon the anticipated success of the new handheld systems 
historically  our revenues generated from products for play on pcs have not been significant 
however  we anticipate generating increased revenues from games played on pcs in the future 
we believe that marketing games to the pc market will help offset the potential negative impact on home console revenues during the next home console transition period 
acquisitions during  we acquired three privately held software developers seattle  washington based surreal software inc surreal in april surreal worked with us in the development of the suffering  a title we released in march the acquisition was completed in an all stock transaction valued at  we also issued stock incentives to key employees valued at austin  texas based inevitable entertainment inc inevitable in october prior to the acquisition  inevitable was working with us on the development of area  a title we plan to release in the acquisition was completed in an all stock transaction valued at  we also issued stock incentives to key employees valued at  moorpark  california based cws entertainment ltd

restructuring late in  we reviewed our year to date performance  our plan for and the corresponding proposed staffing levels 
we determined that we would reduce costs and consolidate operations in order to generate improved results in future periods 
in december  we decided to reduce the amount of leased space used in our milpitas  california facility and terminate a group of mostly product development employees in both our milpitas and san diego  california facilities 
during the first quarter of  we decided to terminate additional employees 
the reduction in personnel associated with the milpitas studio required us to reduce the scope of our product development efforts 
accordingly  three games in development at that time were cancelled due to the reduction in product development resources and our judgment about their prospects resulting in a charge of  during during the second quarter of  we decided that rather than just reducing the size of the milpitas operation  it was advisable to consolidate almost all of its operations into existing facilities in san diego and chicago  illinois 
we recorded charges related to lease commitments for which we will receive no future economic benefit  fixed asset impairments and other costs of  during related to this decision 
the total number of employees terminated from these reductions is  all of whom had been terminated as of december   resulting in restructuring charges of  for anticipated costs to be incurred under these restructuring efforts were accrued and recognized as restructuring costs prior to december  during  we recorded reversals of previously accrued charges totaling  related to changes in estimates of severance costs and sublease income 
during  we recorded reversals of previously accrued charges related to changes in estimates of severance and lease costs  resulting in a net  reduction of our operating loss 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to our business operations 
the interpretation of these policies requires management judgments and estimates of matters which ultimately may differ from actual results 
for a discussion of our other significant accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the software is delivered  the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the customer receivable is probable 
we do not provide any significant customization of software or post contract support 
if consumer demand for a product falls below expectations  we often grant price protection to spur further sales and sometimes accept product returns 
therefore  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for price protection  returns and discounts 
price protection  returns and discounts we often grant price protection or discounts to  and sometimes allow product returns from  our customers 
therefore  we record an allowance for price protection  returns and discounts at each balance sheet date 
price protection means credits relating to retail price markdowns on our products previously sold by us to customers 
we base these allowances on expected trends and estimates of potential future price protection  product returns and discounts related to current period product revenue 
several factors are used in developing these estimates  including a prior experience with price protection  returns and discounts  b historical and expected sell through rates for particular games  c historical and expected rates of requests for such credits  d specific identification of problem accounts  e existing field inventories  f shipments by geography as price protection  returns and discounts experience differs by geography  g terms of sale  h sales rates or trends for similar products  i consideration of price points that would encourage future sell through at the retail level and corresponding price protection credits that would be granted to appropriate customers  j the net price paid by our customers for products on which previous price protection has been granted and k other relevant factors 
sell through refers to consumer purchases of our product at retail from our customers 
actual price protection  product returns and discounts may materially differ from our estimates as our products are subject to changes in consumer preferences  technological obsolescence due to new platforms  or competing products 
changes in these factors could change our judgments and estimates and result in variances in the amount of allowance required 
this may impact the amount and timing of our revenue for any period 
for example  if customers request price protection in amounts exceeding the rate expected and if management agrees to grant it  then we may incur additional charges 
however  we are under no contractual obligation to grant such credits 
during  and  we recorded provisions for price protection  returns and discounts of   and  respectively 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of revenues 
our accounts receivable balance is reported net of an allowance for estimated future price protection and discounts to be issued and estimated future product returns to be accepted from sales made prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and  our allowances for price protection  returns and discounts were  and  respectively 
we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential price protection  returns and discounts 
doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we analyze significant customer accounts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  we may record allowances for doubtful accounts related to customers based on length of time the receivable balance is outstanding  financial health of the customer and historical experience 
this analysis requires management to make estimates of collectibility which may materially differ from actual collections 
if circumstances related to our customers change  the amount and timing of bad debt expense for any period may be impacted 
during  we recorded a  gain on accounts previously written off  net of current year provisions 
during and  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
such amounts are included in administrative expense 
our accounts receivable balance is reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts from sales made prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and  our allowances for doubtful accounts were  and  respectively 
we believe this allowance is adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of doubtful accounts 
capitalized product development costs our capitalized product development costs consist of software development costs for videogames that will be sold 
we account for software development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed by us when incurred and are included in research and development expense 
once a software product has reached technological feasibility  all subsequent software development costs for that product are capitalized until that product is released for sale 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis and can occur early in the development cycle or later depending on required technology to complete the product and the availability of such technology to us 
after a product is released for sale  the capitalized product development costs are amortized to expense based on the ratio of actual cumulative revenues to the total of actual cumulative revenues plus projected future revenues for each game 
this expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales 
we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a product by product basis 
capitalized costs for products that are cancelled are expensed in the period of cancellation 
in addition  a charge to cost of sales is recorded when our forecast for a particular game indicates that unamortized capitalized costs exceed the estimated future net realizable value of that asset 
the estimated future net realizable value is the estimated future revenues from that game reduced by the estimated future cost of completing and selling the game 
if a revised game sales forecast is less than management s current game sales forecast  or if actual game sales are less than management s forecast  it is possible we could accelerate the amortization of software development costs previously capitalized 
as a result  the forecasted sales for a given game are a sensitive factor in this calculation 
critical factors evaluated in estimating forecasted sales include  among other things historical sales of similar titles  pre launch awareness  game ratings from publications and websites  current demand and sell through rates 
management judgments and estimates are used in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs 
different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts of capitalized product development costs  research and development expense or cost of sales 
during  and  we recorded capitalized product development cost impairment charges in cost of sales and  where appropriate  restructuring and other charges of   and  respectively 
our capitalized product development costs at december  and were  and  respectively 
we believe our capitalized product development costs balance at december  is recoverable from future revenue activity 
goodwill in accordance with sfas  we evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
in addition  sfas requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we use october as our annual measurement date and use market capitalization as an initial indicator of our fair value 
we completed our annual impairment test on october  and found no indicators of impairment of goodwill 
as a result  we did not recognize an impairment loss 
the carrying amount of goodwill at december  and was  and  respectively 
future goodwill impairment tests may result in a material charge to earnings if  for example  our enterprise fair value falls below our net book value 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance for the realization of deferred tax assets  resulting primarily from tax loss carryforwards 
the amount of tax loss carryforward expected to be used within the carryforward period is limited to sources of future taxable income that are more likely than not to be generated within the carryforward period 
the valuation allowance recorded is a reduction to the deferred tax asset  with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations 
in the event we determine that we will realize our deferred tax asset in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an increase to the net deferred tax asset would be recorded in the period such determination was made 
generating taxable income in subsequent periods and changes in estimates of future taxable income could affect the amounts of the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
at december  and  we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
stockholder ownership change s  as defined under section of the internal revenue code  may limit the annual amount of net operating loss carryforward we may use to offset future taxable income

gross profit cost of sales cost of sales includes product costs  distribution costs  royalties  and amortization and writedowns of capitalized product development costs 
gross profit increased from a loss of  for to a profit of  for this increase was due to increases in sales volume of approximately and in average per unit selling prices of approximately 
the higher sales volume was due to the release of titles which experienced higher consumer acceptance  such as our franchise title mortal kombat deception and a new title  nba ballers 
the higher average selling price in was the result of a greater portion of revenues being derived from titles released in the current year  including mortal kombat deception  which sold at full retail price during  and nba ballers which sold at full retail price for the majority of a higher proportion of revenues were derived from games released in previous years  which typically have lower price points than current year title releases or from titles that did not gain consumer acceptance and required a greater level of discounting

excluding these costs  research and development overhead costs decreased approximately  from this decrease is a result of the restructuring efforts described in the overview above

the decrease in net revenues was due to releasing the latest version of our highly successful mortal kombat franchise in north america during and a decrease in the number of new titles released from the prior year 
during the second quarter of  we made a decision to add more time and effort to the development of several games and to cancel one game that was in production

gross profit cost of sales cost of sales includes product costs  distribution costs  royalties  and amortization and writedowns of capitalized product development costs 
gross profit decreased  from a profit of  for to a loss of  for this decrease was due to decreases in sales volume of approximately and in average per unit selling prices of approximately 
the lower average selling price was the result of a greater portion of revenues being derived from games released in prior years  which typically have lower price points in the current year than new title releases

preferred stock dividends see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of dividends incurred in relation to our preferred stock 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on alternative fair value models 
the share based compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the stock option grants fair value using the black scholes model and disclosing the impact on loss applicable to common stock and the related per share amount in note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption  pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
see the table under caption stock based compensation in note for the estimated impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had if it had been in effect during  and sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
we will begin to apply sfas no 
r using the most appropriate fair value model beginning with the three month period ending september  we currently plan to adopt the modified prospective application method allowed under sfas no 
r and estimate an additional charge to expense of approximately  in fiscal relating to currently outstanding options 
the actual impact will depend upon the final fair value model selected and any additional options that may be granted during liquidity and capital resources our principal source of operating cash is from distribution and sale of our videogames 
our principal uses of cash are for payments associated with both internal and third party developers of our software  third party manufacturers of our videogame inventory  costs incurred to sell and market our videogames and administrative expenses 
as of december   our primary source of liquidity was  of cash and cash equivalents  compared with  at december  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was impacted by the following financing cash inflows that occurred during the year then ended  of net proceeds received during april from the sale of common stock   of cash received from common stock option and warrant exercises   of net proceeds received during march under a new credit facility and  of net proceeds received from the sale of additional series d redeemable convertible preferred stock 
these inflows from financing activities were partially offset by a net  usage of cash to fund operating activities 
our working capital at december  totaled  compared with  at december  this significant improvement in working capital was achieved primarily through the financing activities discussed above 
our overall business strategy depends on generating revenue from new products 
if our new products fail to gain market acceptance  we may not have sufficient revenues to pay our expenses and to develop a continuous stream of new games 
we actively manage our capital structure and balance sheet as a component of our overall business strategy 
in addition to the items noted above  during  we completed three acquisitions of privately held software developers by issuing shares of our common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during june and july  a total of  of our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future to settle outstanding obligations  such as our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  or to make acquisitions  if terms and conditions allow  alleviating cash use requirements 
gross receivables  excluding the impact of receivable provisions  increased by  during the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in sales volume experienced in the fourth quarter of  specifically sales from the latest installment from the mortal kombat franchise  compared to the fourth quarter of inventories increased by  during  primarily due to remaining units on hand of mortal kombat deception  which was released during the fourth quarter of these units comprised approximately of the inventory balance at december  the increase in other assets  including both current and long term portions  includes a net increase of  related to prepaid publishing  engine and other game related license fees
