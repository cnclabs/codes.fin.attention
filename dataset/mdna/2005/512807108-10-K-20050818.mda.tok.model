table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks  uncertainties and changes in condition  significance  value and effect 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in part i of this annual report on form k 
results of operations lam research corporation lam or the company is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world s semiconductor industry 
we actively market and sell product offerings that include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications  wafer cleaning systems  and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns 
over recent business cycles  the severity of these fluctuations has increased  and today s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years 
demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  economic conditions  supply  demand  and prices for semiconductors  customer capacity requirements  and our ability to develop and market competitive products 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for fiscal years   and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
executive summary we believe our business model continues to set a standard for the industry 
our business model is focused on new product development  sales and marketing  and customer support which are the core competencies of the company 
indicators of customer demand began to improve in our quarter ended september  this trend continued through the quarter ended september   then declined and stabilized over the course of the march and june quarters 
fiscal year revenues increased compared to fiscal year revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market  with particularly strong performance in asia 
the progression in our gross margin of five percentage points from fiscal year to fiscal year was achieved on increased sales volume  improvements in product mix  and effective asset management 
total operating expenses increased by million  or during fiscal year compared to fiscal year increases in operating expenses were primarily driven by increases in salary and benefits costs for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as increases for incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits 
fiscal year operating expenses included restructuring charges of million in connection with our guaranteed residual value guarantee obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans 

table of contents new orders and backlog new orders entered into backlog during fiscal year were approximately three months ended year ended june  march  december  september  june  in millions unshipped orders in backlog as of june  were approximately million 
the basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy 
our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems  spares  and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next months 
our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect  among other things  customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations 
please refer to backlog in part i item  business of this annual report on form k for additional information on our backlog policy 
regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows three months ended year ended june  march  december  september  june  north america europe asia pacific korea japan indicators of customer demand for wafer processing equipment improved in the quarter ended september  and continued through the quarter ended september  since that time  new orders have declined and stabilized in the march and june quarters  which reflects the investment decisions of our customers 
we expect new orders for the quarter ending september  to range from flat to down compared with the quarter ended june  this expectation is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page of this annual report on form k 
revenue year ended june  june  june  in thousands revenue revenue increased significantly during fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers 
we believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market  with particularly strong performance in asia 
our deferred revenue 
table of contents balance was million as of june  the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately million as of june  these shipments are classified as inventory and carried at cost 
the increase in revenues for fiscal year continued the trends noted for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  which were reflective of a market environment that had improved  evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers 
regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows year ended june  june  june  north america europe asia pacific korea japan the overall asia region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is shifting toward this region  this trend continued through fiscal year the growth in asia pacific revenues during fiscal year predominantly occurred in taiwan and singapore 
our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending september  ranges from million to million 
this is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page of this annual report on form k 
gross margin year ended june  june  june  in thousands  except percentages gross margin percent of total revenue the increase in gross margin during fiscal year compared with fiscal year was driven primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume 
the increase in gross margin during fiscal year compared with fiscal year was primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources  expense management programs  and improved sales volumes throughout the year 
we expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately for the quarter ending september  which includes approximately million  or one percentage point  in stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

table of contents research and development year ended june  june  june  in thousands  except percentages research development r d percent of total revenue we continue to invest significantly in research and development in business cycle upturns and downturns 
our investments have been aimed at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of next generation products as well as enhancing our existing offerings 
the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly million for incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits 
the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in r d supplies expense of approximately million 
approximately of fiscal year systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years 
the growth in spending between fiscal years and was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately million  a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits 
these costs were partially offset by reductions in facilities related expenses  largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly million  due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation 
selling  general and administrative year ended june  june  june  in thousands  except percentages selling  general administrative sg a percent of total revenue the increase in sg a expenses during the year ended june  compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately million due to planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly million due to incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits 
also included in the increase was approximately million in professional services which included  among other items  expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company 
these increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year of a net million tax refund from the california state board of equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately million in stock based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award 
expenses in fiscal year were million higher than fiscal year because employee compensation costs increased by nearly million  a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits 
also contributing to the fiscal year sg a expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects 
additionally  the million stock based compensation charge noted above contributed to the increase in fiscal year a decrease of approximately million  primarily in depreciation expense  due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above

these estimates are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page of this annual report on form k 
restructuring charges we distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities 
accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans 
restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities  whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product  facility  or service 
we have historically developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and  at times  depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry 
we systematically reviewed our revenue outlook and forecasts and assessed their impact on required employment levels  facilities utilization  and outsourcing activities scope 
based on these evaluations  our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended march  the march plan  december  the december plan  september  the september plan  june  the june plan  march  the march plan  december  the december plan  december  the december plan  and september  the september plan 
prior to the end of each quarter noted above  we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective plan 
severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit 
the termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced 
the amount of remaining future lease payments recorded in the restructuring charges include facilities for which a contract was terminated in accordance with its terms and charges for facilities  or a portion of facilities we ceased to use 
expenses were based on management s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based  in part  on the opinions of independent real estate experts 
leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off  where these items were determined to have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned 
as of june   the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following severance and benefits facilities total in thousands fiscal year restructurings fiscal year restructurings fiscal year restructurings pre fiscal year restructurings balance at june  less portion included in other current liabilities included in long term liabilities the severance and benefits related balance is anticipated to be utilized by the end of calendar year the facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 
table of contents fiscal year activity during the quarter ended march   we recognized additional liabilities of million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans 
the million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of million less million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities 
during the march quarter  we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale 
we concluded  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  that the likelihood that a liability had been incurred was probable and estimable 
this transaction resulted in an increase of million and million to our fiscal year and fiscal year restructuring plans accruals  respectively 
during the quarter ended june  we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter  the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer 
we exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities  which had been abandoned in prior periods 
pursuant to the lease and participation agreements  our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was million 
the net proceeds of the sale  equal to approximately million  were applied against this obligation 
the remainder of the obligation  our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately million  was paid during the quarter ended june  this transaction is reflected in the fiscal year and fiscal year restructuring plan accrual tables below 
fiscal year restructuring activities our fiscal year restructuring activities included reducing our workforce by less than employees  primarily in north america and europe and by vacating selected facilities located in north america and asia deemed to be no longer necessary to our operations 
the employees were from a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization 
we recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year of approximately million  consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of million  charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of million  and the write off of related leasehold improvements of million 
we also recorded a charge of approximately million due to the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in japan and million for the write off of related leasehold improvements 
we recognized million of additional facilities related expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal year charges during the year were partially offset by the recovery of million of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in japan 
additional offsetting items include recovery of million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our september restructuring 
the inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold 
as a result of the fiscal year restructuring activities  we expected quarterly savings  relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities  in total expenses of approximately million from the march plan  million from the december plan and million from the september plan 
the majority of the savings were expected to be realized within operating expenses  mainly selling  general and administrative expenses 
these estimated savings from the plans discrete actions were primarily related to lower employee payroll  rent  and depreciation expenses 
actual savings may vary from these forecasts  depending upon future events and circumstances  such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts 
through june   we believe actual savings from these plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings 
the fiscal year restructuring charge of million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in fiscal year activity 

table of contents the following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year restructuring plans severance and benefits facilities total in thousands balance at june  fiscal year restructuring charge cash payments balance at june  fiscal year restructuring activities our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year through our june  march and december plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal year of approximately million 
our fiscal year restructuring activities included reducing our workforce in north america  europe  and asia by approximately people and vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in north america  europe  and asia deemed to be no longer required for our operations 
the employees included in the plans were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization  with the majority of the reductions in north america 
the million restructuring charges consisted of million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees and million of facilities related charges 
the facilities related charges consisted of the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities  a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the write off of related leasehold improvements 
in june  a lease covering one of our vacated facilities at our fremont  california campus was amended  combined  restated  and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure 
at the time of the amendment  the leased facility s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately million 
accordingly  this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the million of restructuring charges 
as a result of the fiscal year restructuring activities  we expected quarterly savings  relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities  of approximately million from the june plan  million from the march plan  and million from the december plan 
the majority of the savings were expected to be realized within operating expenses  mainly selling  general and administrative expenses 
these estimated savings were primarily from lower payroll  facilities  and depreciation expenses 
through june   we believe realized savings are consistent with original forecasts 
however  other factors may significantly influence our future cost structure and  consequently  partially or totally offset savings from these plans

the employees were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization  with approximately from north america and approximately from europe and asia locations 
the restructuring charges included million in severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  million in charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities  million in write offs of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets  and million in inventory write downs 
the inventory charge of approximately million related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific systems within our etch product lines 
we recovered approximately million during fiscal year  million during fiscal year  and million during fiscal year  from unanticipated subsequent sales of these inventories to our installed base 
we physically disposed of approximately million of this inventory during fiscal year and million during fiscal years and during fiscal year  we also recovered approximately million of the million due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of million and lower than planned expenses related to a vacated facility of million 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately million of additional restructuring charges due to a revision in estimates for one of our vacated facilities and we recovered approximately million  net  due to the difference between costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement for a facility for which we entered into a lease cancellation agreement during fiscal year during fiscal year  we recovered approximately million for benefits offered that were not utilized by terminated employees and million was recovered due to revisions to the net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities 
we also recorded additional restructuring charges during fiscal year of million due to revisions we made in sublease assumptions for two of our vacated buildings in fremont  california  million due to additional facility restoration costs  and million for revisions that we made in our estimates for employee termination costs 
the fiscal year restructuring charge of million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in fiscal year activity 
the following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year restructuring plans severance and benefits facilities total in thousands balance at june  fiscal year restructuring charge cash payments balance at june  fiscal year restructuring activities during the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed the remaining elements of our restructuring activities under the june plan 
a final million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs

interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated million notes notes in june we elected to make charitable contributions of million during fiscal year during fiscal year  our total cash balances  which consisted of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash  increased each quarter through march these increases in cash balances allowed us to repay  in the june quarter  our notes prior to maturity 
although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year  interest income decreased during fiscal year as a result of lower market rates 
the decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal year is largely due to the redemption of our million subordinated debentures notes in september tax expense benefit our annual income tax expense benefit was million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the fiscal year tax rate was  which primarily reflects the impact of r d tax credits and the proportion of foreign income taxed at lower than us statutory tax rates 
in fiscal year  we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required 
this resulted in a million credit recorded to income tax expense  during fiscal year in april  the internal revenue service irs closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended june  resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to r d tax credits resulting in our recording a million tax benefit in june in addition  a tax expense of approximately million associated with implementing strategies to  in the longer term  limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in june 
table of contents deferred income taxes we had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences  net operating losses  and tax credit carryforwards of million and million in fiscal years and the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of million and million and deferred tax liabilities of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances  if any 
our current valuation allowance of million includes the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options 
when the stock option tax benefits are realized  a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value 
during fiscal year  we released a valuation allowance of million as discussed above 
on october  the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides for a deduction of of certain non us earnings that are repatriated to the us  as defined in the ajca 
on january  and may  the us treasury published notice and notice  respectively  providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction 
based on our current understanding of the ajca  we believe the range of possible amounts that we may consider for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the potential range of related income tax that may be incurred as a result of the repatriation is between zero and million 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable  and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  complex and or subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and we have completed our system installation obligations  received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or 
table of contents customer acceptance obligations 
in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision  we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications 
in situations with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values  provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs  which approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
when the terms of sale do not specify  we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance 
standard costs are re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs  generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts  currently obtainable assembly and test labor performance levels  and overhead for internally manufactured products 
manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage requirements over the next to months is written down to its estimated market value  if less than cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  general semiconductor market conditions  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
warranty typically  the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system 
we offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of months from system acceptance  not to exceed months from shipment of the system to the customer 
when appropriate  we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition 
the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity  which uses factors such as type of system  customer  geographic region  and any known factors such as tool reliability trends 
all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 

table of contents actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis  and may differ from our original estimates 
while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities  if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates  we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified 
accordingly  actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred  and at the same time  additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded 
we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves  all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we offer customer paid extended warranty services 
revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable

r which will become effective during our quarter ending september  pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable 
in addition  the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
we provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates 
our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the company  the level of r d spending  the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed 
we carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate  if necessary 
if actual results differ from estimates  we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate  which could have a material impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no

in march   the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning with the quarter ended september  the effects of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our results of operations and financial position are dependent upon a number of factors  including the number of employee stock options outstanding and unvested  the number of stock based awards which may be granted in the future  the life and vesting features of stock based awards which may be granted in the future  the future market value and volatility of our stock  movements in the risk free rate of interest  award exercise and forfeiture patterns  and the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of each award 
we are currently evaluating these variables in the design of our stock based compensation program as well as the accounting requirements under sfas no 
r and sab no 
in addition  we intend to utilize restricted stock units as a key component of our ongoing employee incentive based compensation plan 
these awards generally are recorded at their fair value  equal to the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of issuance  and this amount is subsequently amortized ratably over the vesting period of the shares of restricted stock held by the employee 
based on the expense for our espp  our outstanding unvested options  and any outstanding unvested restricted stock units  we believe that the expense for stock based compensation for the quarter ending september  will range from million to million  pre tax

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations  some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not  to make future payments under various contracts 
obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below 
our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below 
our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements  and our guarantees are included in the following table operating purchase restructuring leases obligations liabilities total in thousands payments due by period less than year years years over years total operating leases we lease most of our administrative  r d and manufacturing facilities  regional sales service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases  which expire at various dates through certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont  california headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities 
certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 
included in the operating leases years section of the table above is million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our fremont  california campus 
please see the guarantees section below for additional information 
the remaining balances primarily relate to non cancelable facility related operating leases expiring at various dates through purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments  including vendor consigned inventories 
we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities  including elements of our manufacturing  warehousing  logistics  facilities maintenance  certain information technology functions  and certain transactional general and administrative functions 
the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june  under these arrangements and others 
actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges 

table of contents consignment inventories  which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses  are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined 
at june   vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were approximately million 
restructuring liabilities our total restructuring reserves as of june  were million  including million of severance and benefits related costs and million related to lease payments on vacated buildings 
through cash generated from operations  we expect million to be paid over the next twelve months and million to be paid between fiscal year and fiscal year please see the related discussion in restructuring activities within management s discussion and analysis 
guarantees we account for our guarantees in accordance with fasb interpretation guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

fin no 
requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin no 
also requires a company the guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
during fiscal year we recognized additional liabilities of million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans 
the million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of million less million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities 
during fiscal year we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale and we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter  the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer 
pursuant to the lease and participation agreements  our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was million 
the net proceeds of the sale  equal to approximately million  were applied against this obligation 
the remainder of the obligation  our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately million  was paid in the quarter ended june  we exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities which were abandoned in prior periods 
the facilities noted above were among several facilities for which lease agreements were transferred to a new lessor  amended  combined and restated in march and june of as part of the lease agreements  we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately million 
we are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year in the case that the leases are not renewed  we do not exercise the purchase options  the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor s costs 
we maintain cash collateral of million as part of the lease agreements as of june  in separate  specified interest bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet 
the lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity vie as defined by fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities and is therefore not consolidated by us 
we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements  including indemnification for various environmental matters 
we have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications 
as of june   we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications  as we do not believe  based on information available  that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees 

table of contents we have agreements with two financial institutions that guarantee payment of our japanese subsidiary s overdraft protection obligation 
at june   the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements was approximately million  although our japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under these agreements 
we have an agreement enabling us to sell to a financial institution certain us dollar denominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems  subject to recourse provisions 
we discontinued the use of this program during the quarter ended june  and have no current plans to continue usage 
at june  we had no outstanding and uncollected receivables under this agreement 
generally  we indemnify  under pre determined conditions and limitations  our customers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services 
we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations 
we do not believe  based on information available  that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees 
we offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of months from system acceptance  not to exceed months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer 
the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system  customer  and geographic region  modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash compared with million at june  during fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents increased by million  including cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by cash used for investing activities million and cash used for financing activities of million 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal year  consisted of in millions net income non cash charges restructuring depreciation and amortization other  net decrease in deferred tax assets change in other working capital accounts significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year include a decrease of million in net accounts receivable reflecting our focus on timely customer payments 
we discontinued use of our program to sell certain us dollar denominated accounts receivable during the quarter ended june   and we have no current plans to continue usage of the program 
there were no uncollected sold receivables remaining as of june  the change in deferred tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred profit decreased by million reflecting marginally higher revenues as compared to shipments during fiscal year 
table of contents cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year was million and consisted of net purchases of million of short term investments and net capital expenditures of million which consisted primarily of engineering equipment 
restricted cash decreased by million as a result of the closing of the property sale of certain lease facilities discussed in the guarantees section above 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year was million including stock repurchases of million partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and million of reissuance of treasury stock 
in october   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from the public market or in private purchases 
the terms of the repurchase program permit us to repurchase shares through september  during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock at a total price of million 
as of june   the total amount available for repurchase under this program was million 
we expect to continue to purchase shares under this program 
given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry  we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r d and capital infrastructure 
based upon our current business outlook  we believe our levels of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at june  are sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations  investments  and capital expenditures  through at least the next months 
in the longer term  liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we believe that  in the event of such requirements  we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives 
however  given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences  there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business  operating results  and financial condition 
as a result of these risk factors  as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings  our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
no priority or significance is intended  or should be attached  to the order in which the risk factors appear 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations  our operating results may be adversely affected 
because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues  and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed  a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter 
factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include  but are not limited to economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically  the extent that customers use our products and services in their business  timing of customer acceptances of equipment  the size and timing of orders from customers  customer cancellations or delays in our shipments  installations  and or acceptances  changes in average selling prices and product mix  our ability in a timely manner to develop  introduce and market new  enhanced and competitive products  our competitors introduction of new products  legal or technical challenges to our products and technology  changes in import export regulations  transportation  communication  demand  information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of god  wars  terrorist activities and natural disasters  legislative  tax  accounting  or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation  procurement shortages  manufacturing difficulties  the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations  new or modified accounting regulations  and exchange rate fluctuations 
further  because a significant amount of our r d and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont  california campus  natural  physical  logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities including labor disruptions  earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 
we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of high priced systems system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue 
our systems can typically range in price from approximately million to million per unit  and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems 
as a result  the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 

table of contents variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse 
as a result  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns 
business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably 
fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments  revenues and operating results 
we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams  which sometimes result in restructuring charges 
even during periods of reduced revenues  we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive  which may temporarily harm our financial results 
we depend on new products and processes for our success 
consequently  we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully  or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace 
our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence  which would adversely affect our financial results 
in order to develop new products and processes  we expect to continue to make significant investments in r d and to pursue joint development relationships with customers  suppliers or other members of the industry 
we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
moreover  future technologies  processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete  leaving us with non competitive products  or obsolete inventory  or both 
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products  and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our primary products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products  export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions which limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments  
table of contents an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in  increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
in addition  the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than are our competitors that offer additional products as well 
this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers 
such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes 
since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment  our business is affected by our customers use of etching steps in their processes 
should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps  this might have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors 
we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue  new orders and profitability 
as a result  the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict 
similarly  significant portions of our credit risk may  at any given time  be concentrated among a limited number of customers  so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 
strategic alliances may have negative effects on our business increasingly  semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies 
often  one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment 
while this could work to our advantage if lam s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process  it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process 
in the latter case  even if lam s equipment was previously used by a customer  that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance 
similarly  our customers may team with  or follow the lead of  educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps 
if those institutions utilize a competitor s equipment when they establish those processes  it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines 
these actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business 
we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers we obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
we have established long term contracts with many of these suppliers 
these long term contracts can take a variety of forms 
we may renew these contracts periodically 
in some cases  these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years  and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers 
however  several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited 
where practical  our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products  lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 

table of contents our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions  such as information technology  facilities management  and certain elements of our finance organization 
although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts  it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers 
any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and or have a negative effect on our operating results 
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor s semiconductor manufacturing equipment  the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor s equipment  making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line 
we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier s processing equipment  the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application 
accordingly  we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor s equipment 
we are subject to risks associated with our competitors strategic relationships and their introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products  which may affect our ability to sell our existing products 
we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop  as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 
we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide  and to invest in product and process r d 
certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry 
these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell  challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products 
for these reasons  we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 
in addition  our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently  or expect to  offer 
they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
in particular  while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements  we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully  or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive 
accordingly  we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets  competition may intensify  or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results  financial condition  and or cash flows 

table of contents our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations non us sales  accounted for approximately in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year of our total revenue 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years 
we are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations  and international sales are subject to risks including  but not limited to trade balance issues  economic and political conditions  changes in currency controls  differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions  our ability to develop relationships with local suppliers  compliance with us and international laws and regulations  including us export restrictions  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  the need for technical support resources in different locations  and our ability to secure and retain qualified people for the operation of our business 
certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the us government 
our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues 
many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china  which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business 
as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows  there is inherent risk  based on the complex relationships between china  taiwan  japan  and the united states  that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with china and or taiwan and perhaps the entire asia region 
a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material  adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 
we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yen denominated assets and forecasted japanese yen denominated revenue and will continue to enter into hedging transactions  for the purposes outlined  in the foreseeable future 
however  these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction moreover  by hedging our yen denominated assets with currency forward contracts  we may miss favorable currency trends  that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges 
additionally  we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the yen  and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we have business such as the payment of wages and leases in other currencies 
our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities as a global company  our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates  in the valuation of deferred tax assets  in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
in particular  the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the united states  is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 
further  if we elect to repatriate cash held outside the united states pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  our tax rate may increase  even if by a lesser amount than without such legislation 
changes in accounting standards for stock based compensation may adversely affect our operating results  our stock price  and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace the adoption of sfas no 
r requires us to expense all stock based compensation provided to employees beginning with our quarter ending september  the environment for skilled employees that are knowledgeable about our products and services is a competitive one  and we believe that stock based compensation is an important part of the overall compensation that we offer to attract and retain such employees 
sfas no 
r will decrease our earnings based on its measure of the value of stock based compensation 
there is some risk that the design of our compensation plans is ineffective at balancing our profitability and employee retention objectives 
moreover  as we will be adopting these rules before certain other companies in our industry  there may be  for some period of time  an appearance that our earnings are lower than those of comparable companies that have not yet adopted sfas no 
r  which could have a negative effect on our stock price 

table of contents a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals 
we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production  cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products 
these regulations could require us to alter our current operations  to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
our failure to control the use  sale  transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 
if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry  our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities 
during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services  we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls  management processes  information systems and procedures and in training  managing  and appropriately sizing our supply chain  our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis 
our success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 
if we do not adequately meet these challenges  our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline  and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth 
if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies  we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products  augment our market coverage and distribution ability  or enhance our technological capabilities 
as a result  we may make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies  or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies  which no longer fit our long term strategies 
managing an acquired business  disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions  disposition of product lines or technologies  or reduction in personnel or that our management  personnel  or systems will be adequate to support continued operations 
any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
in addition  any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  the amortization of related intangible assets  and goodwill impairment charges  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations and or the price of our common stock 

table of contents the market for our common stock is extremely volatile  which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years 
the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors  including but not limited to the following general market  semiconductor  or semiconductor equipment industry conditions  global economic fluctuations  variations in our quarterly operating results  variations in our revenues or earnings from levels experienced by other companies in our industry or forecasts by securities analysts  announcements of restructurings  technological innovations  reductions in force  departure of key employees  consolidations of operations  or introduction of new products  government regulations  developments in  or claims relating to  patent or other proprietary rights  success or failure of our new and existing products  liquidity of lam  disruptions with key customers or suppliers  or political  economic  or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions 
in addition  the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations 
historically  we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors 
these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following volatile periods in the price of stock  many companies became the object of securities class action litigation 
if we are sued in a securities class action  we could incur substantial costs  and it could divert management s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 
we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business 
these information systems include telecommunications  the internet  our corporate intranet  various computer hardware and software applications  network communications  and e mail 
these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties 
these information systems are subject to attacks  failures  and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses  destructive or inadequate code  power failures  and physical damage to computers  hard drives  communication lines  and networking equipment 
to the extent that these information systems are under our control  we have implemented security procedures  such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes  to address the outlined risks  however  security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 
the potential anti takeover effects of our certificate of incorporation may inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of  shares of undesignated preferred stock 
our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine  which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam 
the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including causing the loss of voting control 
moreover  section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders  as defined by that statute 
such factors might deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers  even if such takeover proposals or control changes could improve our short term stock price 

table of contents intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement  unfair competition or other claims against us 
from time to time  other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam 
in such cases  it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms 
however  we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
moreover  although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property  there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur 
we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights  which would affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secret protection  we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise  continuing our development of new systems  increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base  and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers 
however  we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances  or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently 
we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications 
however  other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications 
in addition  the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or  in fact provide no competitive advantages 
we are subject to the internal control evaluation and attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required  beginning with our fiscal year ended june   to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year 
furthermore  our independent registered public accounting firm firm is required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year 
we have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our firm s attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june  in future years  if we fail to timely complete this assessment  or if our firm cannot timely attest to our assessment  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 
our independent registered public accounting firm must confirm its independence in order for us to meet our regulatory reporting obligations on a timely basis our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the firm and lam that  in the firm s professional judgment  might have a bearing on the firm s independence with respect to us 
if  for whatever reason  our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of lam based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards  we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at june  and june  june  june  there fair after total value total in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate average rate short term investments fixed rate average rate auction rate preferreds variable rate average rate restricted cash fixed rate average rate total investment securities average rate we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 
we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies 
as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues in japan that are denominated in japanese yen  and certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies 
the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars except for expenses related to our non us sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries local currency 
as a result  we believe that our primary exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation is naturally hedged the revenue in local currency partially offsets the exposure to local currency expenses except for our japanese yen revenue exposure in japan 
for this reason  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yen denominated receivable balances 
the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was million 
the unrealized loss on the contracts on june   was million 
a appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of million 
depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately would result in an unrealized gain of million 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was million 
a appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of million 
depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately would result in an unrealized gain of million
