item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our bookings and net revenues and can significantly impact our results of operations  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand 
these industry cycles have lasted typically to months  however  recently the cycles have become less predictable 
be cause the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential quarterly growth or declines in bookings and net revenues throughout the cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  while the general trend over several quarters tends to be one of either growth or decline  in any given quarter the trend in both our bookings and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are pulled in  pushed out or canceled by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net revenues and bookings the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location of the selling entity 
years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers manipulator docking hardware temperature management tester interface intersegment sales us europe asia pacific during  the ate industry was in the midst of a multiple year downturn that began in late during the first half of  the ate industry entered a period of expansion that continued throughout the balance of that year and into the first half of however  late in the third quarter of  there was a significant weakening in the level of our orders in both our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface product segments as several customers of these two segments either postponed scheduled shipments or canceled orders 
the downward trend in orders for our tester interface product segment continued into the fourth quarter of  and for the quarter ended december   our consolidated orders totaled million  a decline of from the million in orders recorded in the second quarter of our tester interface segment experienced the largest decline in orders during  falling from million in the second quarter to  in the fourth quarter 
our manipulator docking hardware product segment s orders declined from a peak of million in the second quarter to million in the fourth quarter  a decrease of 
finally  orders in our temperature management product segment decreased from million in the second quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
we believe the significant declines in orders in both our tester interface and manipulator docking hardware product segments are primarily the result of the suspension of production oriented ordering in the ate industry during the second half of due to reductions in utilization rates for test related equipment 
we also believe that the orders for our temperature management products had not been as heavily impacted by the weakened demand for our other products because these products are used in non production environments  such as research and development labs 
at present  we cannot predict how long the current downturn will remain  nor how significant the declines in our quarterly net revenues or bookings will be through this cycle 
backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  this decrease was due to the aforementioned reduction in orders we experienced in the second half of our backlog includes customer purchase orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost containment and organizational changes in response to the sudden downturn in the second half of  we began the process of restructuring our operations during the fourth quarter with the goal of significantly reducing our fixed operating costs to position ourselves to more effectively meet the needs and expectations of the fluid ate market 
in mid november  we announced organizational changes and cost structure adjustments that gave our divisional general managers increased responsibility for marketing  sales and service  thus allowing for the reduction of corresponding central corporate staff 
specific actions resulting from the fourth quarter reorganization included the elimination of four executive level positions  an approximate reduction in domestic head count  and certain salary and benefit adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred severance costs of approximately  related to these actions 
we expect these actions will reduce our annual operating expense structure by approximately million 
in mid march  we announced our decision to close our uk facility 
we expect to incur severance costs ranging from  to  as well as costs associated with other contractual obligations consisting of lease commitments and real estate taxes ranging from  to  we intend to seek a sublessor for the uk facility which would offset a portion of our continuing obligations for the facility 
based upon these estimates  the total cost to close our uk facility will range from approximately  to million 
we expect to incur these costs during the first and second quarters of we expect the closure of our uk facility will reduce our annual operating expenses by approximately million 
we believe our recent reorganization and resultant decentralization will make us a more competitive company positioned to rapidly adapt to new market challenges and opportunities through continued research and development as well as strategic merger and acquisition activities 
as a result of our continuing focus on our global operations to determine methods to increase our profitability while operating in the cyclical ate markets  we will continue to review and evaluate actions that will optimally match our operating costs against our anticipated future revenue and product demand as we pursue additional growth opportunities 
inventory obsolescence charges we review our inventories and record inventory obsolescence charges based upon our established obsolescence criteria  that identifies material that has not been used in a work order during the prior months and the excess quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in addition  in certain cases  additional inventory obsolescence charges are recorded based upon facts which would not give rise to an obsolescence charge under the historical obsolescence criteria or  if in management s opinion  additional amounts are felt to be necessary based upon the current industry conditions 
see also critical accounting policies  below 
we incurred inventory obsolescence charges of million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of inventory obsolescence charges are based upon a variety of factors including changes in demand for our products and new product designs 
the increase in inventory obsolescence charges during was primarily the result of customer order cancellations where we had already purchased inventory to fulfill the orders and where that inventory can not be used in other products we manufacture due to its highly customized nature 
in addition we had increases in our reserves for excess quantities related to materials with long lead times that were purchased based upon forecasted orders which did not materialize 
after the close of the third quarter of  management made the determination to curtail the practice of purchasing significant amounts of inventory against forecasted orders due to the increased level of uncertainty in our current business o utlook 
however  in the future  we may determine that it is appropriate to increase the level of such purchases based on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  general market conditions and the specific delivery requirements of our customers 
see also critical accounting policies 
product warranty charges we accrue product warranty charges on a quarterly basis based upon our historical claims experience 
in addition  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
for the years ended december   and  our product warranty charges were million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the level of our product warranty charges both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenues is affected by a number of factors including the cyclicality of demand in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the complex nature of many of our products and  at our discretion  providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the contracted warranty period has expired in order to promote strong customer relations 
during we accrued approximately  in product warranty charges in our manipulator docking hardware product segment for product retrofits on several manipulator products we sell to both oem and end user customers worldwide 
of this amount  the largest portion  which was approximately  was related to field retrofits on approximately m series manipulators whose prototype design required several different modifications and enhancements 
we believe we have accrued adequate warranty charges at december  for the product retrofits planned for these products 
the balance of our product warranty accruals were general in nature and related to various products sold in all three product segments 
we cannot determine at this time if we will have additional product modifications or enhancements for these or any of our other products 
see also critical accounting policies 
product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of intellectual property such as patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
we sell our products to both semiconductor manufacturers end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the year ended december   and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were  and  respectively 
the impact of an increase in oem sales as a percentage of net revenues is generally a reduction in our gross margin  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount than end user sales 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales for these product segments  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we also expect to continue to experience demands from our oem customers supply line management groups to reduce our sales prices to them 
this continued price pressure may have the ultimate effect of reducing our gross and operating margins if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or to improve the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of temperature management systems results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
we believe that this business usually is less cyclical than new ate s ales 
please refer to the section entitled risks that could affect future results below for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of each such business 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense impairment of goodwill operating income loss other income earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net earnings loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we believe the increase in our net revenues reflects the aforementioned stronger cyclical demand early in compared to the weaker demand throughout in  the net revenues of our manipulator docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface segments increased million or  million or and million or  respectively  over the comparable prior period 
we believe the increases in all of our product segments reflect the aforementioned increase in demand we experienced for our products throughout the first half of we believe the larger percentage increases in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments reflect the increased production requirements of our customers during the first half of during the year ended december   our net revenues from customers in the us  europe and asia pacific increas ed  and  respectively  over the comparable prior period 
the larger percentage increase for our european customers was primarily the result of the significant appreciation of the euro against the us dollar during when adjusted to eliminate the effect of the change in exchange rates  the growth rate in the net revenues from our european customers was  which is consistent with both the us and asia pacific 
gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the improvement in the gross margin was primarily the result of our fixed operating costs being more fully absorbed by the significantly higher net revenue levels in compared to while the absolute dollar amount of our fixed operating costs increased million in as compared to  the percentage of net revenues which these costs represent decreased from in to in we attribute the increase in the absolute dollar amount of our fixed operating costs primarily to higher salary and benefits expense which increased million over the comparable prior period 
this increase was due largely to the hiring of additional staff and the fact that as industry conditions improved during we began to reinstate certain previously eliminated employee benefits and our program of annual reviews and merit based salary increases 
also contributing to the increase in fixed operating costs  but to a lesser ex tent  were increases in insurance  third party consultants and facility rental 
the increases in both insurance and third party consultants were driven by the increased level of business activity in compared to intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased commission expense as well as higher levels of salary and benefits expense in as compared to the increase in commission expense of million in our manipulator docking hardware and temperature management segments was primarily due to the significantly higher net revenue levels 
the  increase in salary and benefits expense primarily reflects the reinstatement of certain employee benefits as previously discussed 
also contributing to the increase  but to a lesser extent  were increases in travel and freight expense  which were driven by the increased business activity in compared to engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to a  increase in salary and benefits expense due largely to hiring additional staff and the reinstatement of certain employee benefits as previously discussed 
in addition  we had increased spending on engineering travel in our manipulator docking hardware segment due to the increased business activity in compared to these increases were partially offset by a reduction in fees paid to third party product development consultants in our manipulator docking hardware and temperature management segments 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to a  increase in salary and benefits expense  which is largely a result of the reinstatement of employee benefits  as previously discussed 
also contributing to the increase was a  increase in professional fees  due primarily to increased audit fees  costs associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and increased patent filing activities 
to a lesser extent  we attribute the increase to higher levels of administrative travel expense  accruals for profit based bonuses and an increase in the fees paid to members of our board of directors 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for  there were no comparable expenses incurred during the restructuring and other charges in consisted of severance costs of approximately  related to the reorganization of our domestic operations  as previously discussed  and long lived asset impairment of  related to our uk facility 
other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in other income was primarily due to a significant increase in our foreign exchange transaction losses  which increased from  in to  in the increase in foreign exchange losses was due to the volatility throughout of the us dollar against the major foreign currencies we operate in worldwide 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was  for compared to million for our effective tax rate for was compared to in our income tax expense for represented the foreign income tax expense related to the earnings of certain of our foreign operations 
during  we increased our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets by  due to the taxable losses experienced in our domestic and certain foreign operations and the uncertainty surrounding whether we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize these losses before they expire 
during  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to our operating losses which resulted in the realizability of the net deferred tax assets to no longer be considered more likely than not 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
in  net revenues for our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments increased million  or  and  or  respectively 
these increases were offset by a decrease in net revenues in our temperature management segment of  or 
we believe the increases in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments are due to the aforementioned increase in demand we experienced for our products throughout we believe that the decrease in net revenues for our temperature management segment reflects the severe cyclical downturn in demand for ate in the industry generally 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross margin 
gross margin remained relatively unchanged in from the gross margin in was slightly over compared to slightly less than in the slight increase in gross margin in is primarily the result of a decrease in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues that reflects lower levels of fabrication costs due to process improvements as well as the mix of products sold and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in oem sales as a percentage of total sales in compared to  as previously discussed 
also  as previously discussed  we incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence during both and as a result of the continued downturn in the industry 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million in  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to the aforementioned increase in product warranty costs in our manipulator docking hardware and temperature management segments 
other significant year over year increases included commission expense as well as salary and benefits expense 
the increase in commission expense of  was due to an increase in end user commissionable sales 
the increase in salary and benefit expense of  was due to the hiring of new sales staff in the manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments as well as the return of certain benefits that had previously been reduced or eliminated 
to a lesser extent  there were increases in travel expenses  freight costs and demonstration equipment  all of which were driven by the increased level of business activity as demand improved throughout engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million in  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to an increase of  in salary and benefits expense in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments  where we increased our engineering and product development staff as well as returned certain benefits that had previously been reduced or eliminated 
also contributing to the increase were higher levels of spending on third party product development consultants and travel in our manipulator docking hardware and temperature management segments 
the increases in staffing  third party consultant costs and travel were due to increased product development efforts throughout these increases were partially offset by reductions in spending on product development materials in our temperature management segment in compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased data processing costs in our manipulator docking hardware segment as well as increased salary and benefits expense in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments 
the  increase in data processing costs are related to a company wide erp system conversion that began in the fourth quarter of at our primary location in the manipulator docking hardware segment and will continue into at our tester interface segment and into at the remaining locations in our manipulator docking hardware segment 
the  increase in salary and benefits expense was the result of the return of certain benefits that had been reduced or eliminated 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees as well as reductions in spending on fees for tax services and communications 
the decrease in legal fees in compared to is primarily due to the settlement of patent litigation during the first quarter of other income 
other income was  for compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase in other income was primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange transaction losses of  in compared to to a lesser extent  the increase was attributable to reduced interest expense in compared to partially offsetting the benefit of these two items was a reduction in interest income in compared to due to lower average cash balances 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million for compared to an income tax benefit of million for our effective tax rate for was compared to for during  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our beginning of the year net deferred tax assets due to our operating losses which resulted in the realizability of the net deferred tax assets to no longer be considered more likely than not 
in addition  we recorded approximately  of income tax expense in  due to the earnings of certain of our foreign operations as well as a reduction in the anticipated amount of tax refunds resulting from research and development credits filed for in during  we recorded a one time tax benefit of  which resulted from our filing amended prior year tax returns to claim additional research and experimentation credits for prior years 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in operations of million in the shift to cash provided by operations in from cash used in operations in was primarily the result of generating operating income for compared with operating losses in also contributing to this shift was a million reduction in accounts receivable during the decline in accounts receivable between december  and december  was due to the reduced level of sales in the fourth quarter of compared to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of inventories increased million during as a result of purchases of materials with long lead times for forecasted orders  as discussed above 
accounts payable decreased million from december  to december  due to decreased purchases to support lower production levels during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in accr ued wages and benefits increased  primarily as a result of the return of domestic salary increases in  which had been suspended since purchases of machinery and equipment were million for the year ended december   which consisted of  primarily for computer hardware and software as well as leasehold improvements for our cherry hill facility   primarily for additional machine shop equipment for our uk subsidiary   primarily for demonstration equipment and computer hardware and software for our temptronic facility  and  primarily for a combination of quality assurance inspection equipment  engineering software and testing equipment and leasehold improvements for our tester interface division 
the balance of purchases was for equipment for our other foreign subsidiaries 
the leasehold improvements for our cherry hill facility relate primarily to replacement of the roof and modifications related to the relocation of our machine shop from its current location to the main facility 
the leasehold improvements for our tester interface division relate to its new facility in san jose  ca 
we currently esti mate we will spend approximately  during the first quarter of for leasehold improvements and furnishings for our new san jose facility 
in addition  we estimate we will spend  during the first quarter of on the relocation of our machining operation in new jersey into our manufacturing facility 
we have no commitments for capital expenditures for the balance of  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we will make such purchases as we deem necessary and appropriate 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  which consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  offset by  in payments made under capital lease obligations 
our total committed contracts that will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year in thousands contractual commitments beyond total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations letters of credit inventory material purchase commitments committed capital expenditure projects we have a secured credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of  we have not utilized this facility to borrow any funds 
our usage consists of the issuance of letters of credit in the face amount of  we pay a quarterly fee of per annum on the total amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
the terms of the loan agreement require that we maintain a minimum level of  of domestic cash 
this credit facility expires on september  we believe that our existing cash balances plus the anticipated cash provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
as previously discussed  during the second half of we entered a cyclical downturn in our industry and experienced a significant decline in our orders and sales activity that we believe will continue into as with prior cycles  we cannot predict how long the current downturn will continue  nor how significant the declines in both our quarterly net revenues and bookings will be throughout this period of contraction 
as previously intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued discussed  we have implemented a restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and lower our break even point 
however  if we are unable to reduce our operating expenses sufficiently during this downturn  we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet working capital or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to raise such additional financing or upon what terms such financing would be available 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  effective december  sab no 
updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of sabs to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance and sec rules and regulations related to revenue recognition 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab no 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting of expenses related to restructurings initiated after  and applies to costs associated with an exit activity including a restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing products lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas no 
changes some of the criteria for recognizing a liability for these activities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an effect on our results of operations  financial condition or long term liquidity 
on october   the american jobs creation action the ajca was signed into law and the ajca contains many tax provisions expected to affect us over the next several years as those provisions become effective 
we are continuing to review these provisions and their application to some of our businesses to evaluate the effect these changes may have on income taxes included in our consolidated financial statements 
the ajca provides for the deduction for us federal income tax purposes of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in we will commence an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision in the first half of the ajca also provides for a domestic manufacturing deduction for us federal income tax purposes 
we will not benefit from this deduction until the date in the future that the us federal tax losses have been fully absorbed 
we will continue to apply the r ules under the extraterritorial income exclusion under the ajca transition rules in and in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of manufacturing be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
r will require us to expense sbp awards as compensation with such expense measured at the fair value of such sbp transaction 
the fasb originally stated a preference for a lattice model of valuation because it believed that a lattice model more fully captures the unique characteristics of employee stock options in the estimate of fair value  as compared to the black scholes model which we currently use for our footnote disclosure 
the fasb decided to remove its explicit preference for a lattice model and not require a single valuation methodology

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued those related to inventories  identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill  deferred income tax valuation allowances and warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based upon our review process 
the criteria to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete are if the inventory was not utilized in a work order during the prior months or if the excess quantity of inventory on hand is greater than the average annual usage of that inventory or in the case of our temperature management systems  three years of average annual usage due to the after sale service requirements of these products 
in addition  operations and accounting staff review inventory that would not meet these criteria for excess or obsolescence to determine if additional obsolescence charges are necessary based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
finally  in certain cases  a subjective amount is recorded based upon either additional facts which would not give rise to an obsolescence charge under the initial obsolescence criteria or  if in management s opinion  additional amounts are felt to be necessary based upon the current industry conditions 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
long lived asset valuation we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we prepare projections of operations for our product segments where these intangibles and or long lived assets are associated 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets and or long lived assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows per the projections  then we would record an impairment charge 
we measure the impairment based upon the projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
due to a history of operating losses experienced by our uk subsidiary over the last four years  combined with our then current forecasts that indicated additional future losses for the uk operation  we performed an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of this operation s long lived assets 
these long lived assets consisted of property and equipment 
based upon this assessment  we recorded an impairment loss of  at december  goodwill when we determine that an impairment review is necessary for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
if the result from this analysis indicates that an impairment charge is required  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets  resulting in an implied valuation of goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
we would measure the impairment based on the difference between the implied valuation of the goodwill and its actual carrying value 
during  we did not record any impairment charges for identifiable intangibles or goodwill 
intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill were million at december  income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
during  we increased our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets by  warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that will occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
in  we recorded product warranty charges of million 
risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
these factors may also cause our future results to differ materially from our prior results 
our forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  intends  may  will  should or anticipates or similar terminology  and include  but are not limited to  statements made in this report regarding the indicators of the reversal of the downturn in the ic and ate industries  developments and trends in the ic and ate industries  the possibility of future acquisitions  costs and timing of completion and integration of our acquisitions  our cost containment initiatives  the implementation of current and future restructuring initiatives  costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and new sec regulations  the development of new products and technologies by us or our competitors  the availability of materials used to manufacture our products  the availability of qualified personnel  general economic conditions  net revenues generated by foreign subsidiaries  exchange rate fluctuations and the use of forward exchange rate contracts  the increasing use of front end testing by semiconductor manufacturers  stock price fluctuations  the anticipated market for our products  and the sufficiency of cash balances  lines of credit and net cash from operations 
our operating results and financial condition could continue to be negatively impacted if the semiconductor industry into which we sell our products remains depressed 
the downturn that ran from late until mid in the semiconductor and ate industries was the worst these industries have ever experienced 
in the second half of  we entered another down cycle 
these downturns created significantly diminished demand for our products  excess manufacturing capacity in our plants  and the erosion of average selling prices 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while current industry forecasts suggest that the current downturn in the semiconductor and ate industries may reverse in the second half of  we cannot be certain that such reversal will occur or that it will be the beginning of an up cycle 
any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price 
an up cycle that is more rapid than we expect may require additional debt or equity financing to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot be sure that such financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms 
our sales reflect the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
capital expenditures by these companies depend upon  among other things  the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them 
typically  semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downtown 
conversely  semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products 
these market changes have contributed in the past  and will likely continue to contribute in the future  to fluctuations in our operating results 
if we are not able to control our operating expenses during a cyclical downturn  or if an upturn is more rapid than we anticipate  we may not have sufficient cash to operate our businesses 
during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our operations with the goal of significantly reducing our fixed operating costs to position ourselves to more effectively meet the needs of the fluid ate market 
these restructuring actions included workforce reductions  salary reductions  a temporary elimination of domestic retirement benefits and additional cost controls on other expenditures 
in addition  subsequent to december   we have evaluated our manufacturing capacity worldwide and determined we had excess capacity in europe 
as a result of this determination  we will be closing our uk operation during the first half of if the downturn continues and we are not able to control our operating expenses  they could increase and the level of our cash may not be sufficient to operate our businesses 
conversely  if the downturn has ended and a strong upturn ensues  we may need additional cash to finance our working capital needs or for capital expenditures 
we cannot determine with certaint y that  if needed  we would be able to raise additional funding through either equity or debt financing 
our operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
during the last several years  our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
we believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
in addition to the changing cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry  other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past  and that may cause fluctuations or losses in the future  include the technological obsolescence of our inventories  quantities of our inventories greater than is reasonably likely to be utilized in future periods  significant product warranty charges  the recording of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  competitive pricing pressures  the impairment of our assets due to reduced future demand for our products  our ability to control operating costs  costs associated with implementing our restructuring initiatives  costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and new sec regulations  delays in shipments of our products  the mix of our products sold  intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products  changes in the level of our fixed costs  costs associated with the development of our proprietary technology  costs and timing of integration of our acquisitions and plant relocations and expansions  our ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed  and cancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers 
because the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on  and in relation to  changes in our operating results  fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue 
our customers purchasing patterns are erratic and can result in fluctuations in our backlog and quarterly results 
our backlog declined from million at june  to million at december  as a result of the cyclical downturn which began late in the third quarter 
our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders necessary to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter 
orders in our backlog are subject to cancellation  delay or rescheduling by our customers with limited or no penalties or ability to collect bill back amounts 
throughout recent years  we have experienced customer requested shipment delays and order cancellations  and we believe it is probable that orders will be cancelled and or delayed in the future 
in addition  during a downturn  some of our customers may rely on short lead times generally available from suppliers  including us  whereas in periods of stronger demand  and longer lead times  customers need to book orders earlier 
we have experienced increased levels of product warranty costs in recent periods and cannot predict the level of such costs that we may incur in future periods 
we accrue product warranty charges on a quarterly basis based upon our historical claims experience 
in addition  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
for the years ended december    and  our product warranty charges were million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the level of our product warranty charges both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is affected by a number of factors including the cyclicality of demand in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the complex nature of many of our products and  at our discretion  providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the contractual warranty period has expired in order to promote strong customer relations 
if our products have reliability  quality or other problems  or the market perceives our products to be deficient  we may suffer reduced orders  higher manufactur ing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and higher service  support and warranty expenses 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in some of our corporate governance procedures and our disclosure and compliance practices 
that act also required the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals the sec had already made  and nasdaq revised  and continues to revise  its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
these developments have increased our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
we expect these developments to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage or reduce our coverage 
this could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and executive officers 
in order to comply with certain requirements of the sabanes oxley act  such as the internal control system requirements of section of the act  we have incurred expense and expect to incur significant addit ional expense in future periods to comply with these new requirements 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
we seek to acquire additional businesses 
if we are unable to do so  our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses  technologies or products that expand and complement our current businesses 
we may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy if we are unable to identify suitable businesses or technologies to acquire  we do not have access to required capital at the necessary time  or we are unwilling or unable to outbid larger  more resourceful companies 
our acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
if we acquire additional businesses  technologies or products  we will face the following additional risks future acquisitions could divert management s attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management  operational and financial resources  we might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably  we may realize substantial acquisition related expenses which would reduce our net earnings in future years  and our investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire 
if any of the events described above occur  our earnings could be reduced 
if we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions  we would dilute our existing stockholders interests and our earnings per share may decrease 
if we issue debt in connection with any future acquisitions  lenders may impose covenants on us which could  among other things  restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses 
our industry is subject to rapidly evolving technological change  and our business prospects would be negatively affected if we are unable to respond to innovation in the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ics into an increasing variety of products 
this trend  and the rapid changes needed in automatic testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor industry  are likely to continue 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing  manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or attain market acceptance 
our failure to provide products that meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will negatively affect our business prospects 
if we are not able to obtain patents on or otherwise preserve and protect our proprietary technologies  our business may suffer 
we have obtained domestic and foreign patents covering some of our products which expire between the years and  and we have pending applications for additional patents 
some of our products utilize proprietary technology that is not covered by a patent or similar protection  and in many cases  cannot be protected 
we cannot be certain that any additional patents will be issued on our applications  any patents we own now or in the future will protect our business against competitors that develop similar technology or products  our patents will be held valid if they are challenged or subjected to reexamination or reissue  others will not claim rights to our patented or other proprietary technologies  or others will not develop technologies which are similar to  or can compete with  our unpatented proprietary technologies 
if we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary technologies  our ability to compete in our markets could be impaired 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued claims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses 
from time to time  we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  may consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may be costly to us 
if we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms  our business could suffer 
in instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others  or that someone may be infringing our patent rights  we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question  as well as the potentially infringing conduct 
if we become involved in a dispute  neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel s conclusions 
our business will suffer if we cannot compete successfully with manufacturers whose products are similar to ours 
we compete with numerous manufacturers  many of whom have greater financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than we do 
some of our principal competitors in the sale of manipulator  docking and tester interface products are reid ashman manufacturing inc  microhandling gmbh  esmo ag  credence systems corp  ltx corporation  teradyne inc  xandex inc 
and kulicke soffa industries  inc some of our principal competitors in the sale of temperature management products are trio tech international  thermonics inc and ers elektronik gmbh 
in order to remain competitive with these and other companies  we must be able to continue to commit a significant portion of our personnel  financial resources  research and development and customer support to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
if we are not able to compete successfully  our business will suffer 
we generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers 
if we were to lose one or more of our large customers  operating results could suffer dramatically 
texas instruments inc and teradyne inc 
accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenues in our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenues in the loss of any one or more of our largest customers  or a reduction in orders by a major customer  could materially reduce our net revenues or otherwise materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
significant fluctuations in our net revenues strain our management  employees and other resources 
over the last several years  we have experienced significant fluctuations in our net revenues due to the cyclical nature of the ate industry 
in  our net revenues declined from a peak of million in the second quarter to million in the fourth quarter  a decline of 
during the prior downturn  our net revenues declined from a peak of million for the quarter ended september  to million for the quarter ended september   a decline of 
conversely  in previous upcycles  our net revenues have increased significantly period over period 
as a result of these sometimes sudden and significant changes in our market  we have had to restructure our operations frequently in recent years 
these fluctuations in our net revenues and their impact on our operating results  place strain on our management  employees and other resources 
if we do not continue to retain the services of key personnel  relationships with  and sales to  some of our customers could suffer 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively 
our future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and certain other key employees 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key employees 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to retain our managers  engineers and other key employees 
our business could suffer if we were unable to retain one or more of our senior officers or other key employees 
a substantial portion of our operations exists outside the us  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
we have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations as necessary to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non us customers 
our foreign subsidiaries generated and of intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued consolidated net revenues in and  respectively 
export sales from our us manufacturing facilities totaled million  or of consolidated net revenues  in and million  or of consolidated net revenues  in the portion of our consolidated net revenues that were derived from sales by our subsidiaries in the asia pacific region was in and in we expect our international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues 
however  in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the us  sales to customers outside the us and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks  which may  in the future  affect our operations 
these risks include political and economic instability in foreign countries  the imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments  the need to comply with a wide variety of us and foreign import and export laws  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and the greater difficulty of administering business abroad 
we conduct business in foreign currencies  and fluctuations in the values of those currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
in  approximately of our net revenues were denominated in japanese yen  approximately were denominated in british pounds  and approximately were denominated in euros 
during  we recorded foreign exchange currency transaction losses of  future fluctuations in the values of these currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
any strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the currencies of our competitors or customers  or strengthening or weakening of the japanese yen  british pound or euro in relation to other currencies in which our customers or competitors do business  could adversely affect our competitiveness 
moreover  a strengthening of the us dollar or other competitive factors could put pressure on us to denominate a greater portion of our sales in foreign currencies  thereby increasing our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
any devaluation of these currencies would hurt our business 
we do not undertake hedging activities against all of our exchange ra te risk 
fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our competitive position or result in foreign exchange losses  either of which could cause our business to suffer 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
we prepare our financial statements to conform to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap is subject to the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting rules affecting many aspects of our business  including rules relating to accounting for business combinations  asset impairment  revenue recognition  restructuring or disposal of long lived assets and stock option grants have recently been revised or are currently under review 
changes to those rules or current interpretation of those rules may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct our business 
for example  sfas no 
r requires that employee stock option plan shares be treated as a compensation expense 
we have not yet determined the impact of applying the various pro visions of sfas no 
r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk management we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk in the normal course of our business  primarily in our foreign operations 
our exposure results from the fact that some or all of the product sales at these operations are in one currency and inventory purchases are in another currency 
in our uk operation  approximately of our sales are in us dollars or euros and the corresponding inventory purchases to support these sales are in british pounds 
in our singapore operation  of our sales intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued are in us dollars but some of our manufacturing costs are in british pounds and singapore dollars 
in our japanese operation  of our sales are in japanese yen and inventory purchases are in us dollars 
in one of our german operations  our sales are in euros while inventory purchases are in us dollars 
in our other german operation  a portion of our sales are occasionally in us dollars but all of our manufacturing costs are in euros 
from time to time we employ risk management strategies  including the use of forward exchange rate contracts  to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the yen  and may  in the future  use forward exchange rate contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the british pound  the singapore dollar or the euro 
our objective in managing currency exchange risk is to minimize the impact of significant currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we use forward exchange rate contracts to establish a fixed conversion rate between the japanese yen and the us dollar so that the level of our gross margin from sales in japan is not negatively affected by significant movements in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
we purchase forward exchange rate contracts on a monthly basis in the amounts management deems appropriate in light of the amount of the us dollar denominated obligations of our japanese subsidiary that are due within the month 
we do not purchase forward contracts with settlement dates beyond days 
as of december   there were no forward exchange rate contracts outstanding 
it is our policy to enter into forward exchange rate contracts only to the extent necessary to achieve the desired objectives of management in limiting our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we do not hedge all of our currency exchange rate risk exposures in a manner that would completely eliminate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our net earnings 
we do not expect that the results of our operations or our liquidity will be materially affected by these risk management activities 
interest rate risk management as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we generally place our investments in us treasury obligations or money market funds backed by such investments 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments
