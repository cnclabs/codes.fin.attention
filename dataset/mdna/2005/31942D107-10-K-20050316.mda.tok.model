the company was in compliance with the requirements and covenants of the credit facility as of december  and march  the company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of of on the average daily unused portion of the credit facility commitment 
the company s credit facility contains provisions that allow the company to repurchase stock and or pay cash dividends within certain parameters 
substantially all of the unencumbered assets of the company have been pledged as collateral against indebtedness under the credit facility 
as of december   the company s primary sources of liquidity were  in cash and cash equivalents   in service charges receivable   in pawn and short term advance receivables   in inventories and  of available and unused funds under the company s credit facility 
the company had working capital as of december  of  and an equity to liabilities ratio of to the company utilized positive cash flows from operations in to fund investing and financing activities primarily related to opening new stores  fund growth of receivables and inventory balances in existing stores  to reduce outstanding debt and to purchase treasury stock

the combined net cash flows from operations and pawn and short term advance receivables totaled  for fiscal the profitability and liquidity of the company is affected by the amount of pawn loans outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s lending decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of pawn redemption by increasing or decreasing the amount pawned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate pawn balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges 
additionally  small advances in relation to the pledged property s estimated resale value tend to increase pawn redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing larger pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
also  larger average pawn balances can result in an increase in pawn forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
the company s renewal policy allows customers to renew pawns by repaying all accrued service fees on such pawns  effectively creating a new pawn transaction 
the amount of short term advances outstanding and related potential loss provision expense also affect the profitability and liquidity of the company 
an allowance for losses is provided on active short term advances and service charges receivable  based upon expected default rates  net of estimated future recoveries of previously defaulted short term advances and service charges receivable 
the company considers short term advances to be in default if they are not repaid on the due date  and writes off the principal amount and service charges receivable as of the default date  leaving only active receivables in the reported balances 
net defaults and changes in the short term advance allowance are charged to the short term advance loss provision 
in addition to these factors  merchandise sales and the pace of store expansions affect the company s liquidity 
management believes that the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the company s current operations for fiscal the company has no significant capital commitments 
the company currently has no written commitments for additional borrowings or future acquisitions  however  the company intends to continue to grow and may seek additional capital to facilitate expansion 
the company will evaluate acquisitions  if any  based upon opportunities  acceptable financing  purchase price  strategic fit and qualified management personnel 
the company currently intends to continue to engage in a plan of expansion primarily through new store openings 
during fiscal  the company currently plans to open approximately new stores  comprised of both payday advance locations  primarily located in texas  and pawnshops  primarily in mexico 
this expansion is expected to be funded entirely through operating cash flows 
while the company continually looks for  and is presented with potential acquisition candidates  the company has no definitive plans or commitments for further acquisitions 
if the company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire new stores in the near future  the company will seek additional financing  the terms of which will be negotiated on a case by case basis 
between january  and march   the company opened new check cashing short term advance locations and pawnshops  while pawnshop located in the us was closed 
contractual commitments a tabular disclosure of contractual obligations at december   including cash go  ltd  is as follows payments due by period in thousands less more than than total year years years years operating leases      employment contracts for chief executive officer and president     total      off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the amount of pawns and short term advances made or unredeemed goods sold by the company  or its results of operation 
seasonality the company s retail business is seasonal in nature with its highest volume of merchandise sales occurring during the first and fourth calendar quarters of each year 
the company s lending and short term advance activities are also seasonal  with the highest volume of lending activity occurring during the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year 
recent regulatory pronouncements in  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  which regulates the ability of state chartered banks to enter into relationships with out of state payday loan servicers  issued guidelines under which such arrangements are permitted 
texas is the only state in which the company functions as loan servicer through a relationship with a state chartered bank  county bank of rehoboth beach  delaware  that is subject to the fdic guidelines for payday lending 
on march   the fdic issued revised payday lending guidelines for fdic supervised banks  such as county bank 
the revised guidelines include a requirement that such banks develop procedures to ensure that a payday loan is not provided to any customer with payday loans outstanding from any bank for more than three months in the previous twelve months 
it currently remains to be determined what procedures may be proposed by the lending banks or accepted by the fdic in order to meet these guidelines 
the company and county bank are currently in the process of reviewing the revised guidelines and expect to implement any necessary changes in lending procedures to comply with them 
the company s payday advance revenues from texas locations totaled  in fiscal and represented approximately of the company s total revenues for the company expects that implementation of the revised guidelines could have a negative effect on some portion of its payday lending revenues in its texas locations  that are the company s only locations which currently use a bank relationship subject to the fdic s payday lending guidelines 
until the company and county bank complete their review of the revised guidelines and the fdic approves the revised procedures expected to be developed by county bank and or other banks providing payday loans  the exact timing and amount of the financial impact of the revised guidelines cannot be estimated 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb enacted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payments  which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r will be effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after july  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if the company had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
the company is evaluating the terms and structure of its current share based payments and does not expect the adoption to have a significant  adverse impact on the consolidated statements of income and net income per share as it relates to current granted options and warrants as of the date of the adoption 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities formerly special purpose entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
the objective of fin is not to restrict the use of variable interest entities  but to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements are effective for the first period that ends after march   however  the company elected to adopt the requirements effective december  the effect of the adoption of fin on the consolidated financial statements is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk in regards to its long term line of credit 
as of march   the line of credit did not have an outstanding balance  therefore  the company s interest rate risk for is immaterial 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts 
accordingly  the company is subject to changes in market interest rates 
however  the company does not believe a change in these rates would have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition  or cash flows 
foreign currency risk a majority of the company s pawn loans in mexico are currently contracted and settled in us dollars  and therefore the company bears limited exchange risk from its operations in mexico 
the company maintained certain mexican peso denominated pawn loan balances at december   which converted to a us dollar equivalent of  the company also maintained certain peso denominated bank balances at december   which converted to a us dollar equivalent of  a increase in the peso to us dollar exchange rate would increase the company s foreign currency translation exposure by approximately  gold price risk a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of jewelry inventories held by the company and the value of jewelry pledged as collateral by pawn customers 
as a result  the company s profit margins on existing jewelry inventories would be negatively impacted  as would be the potential profit margins on jewelry currently pledged as collateral by pawn customers in the event it is forfeited by the pawn customer 
in addition  a decline in gold prices could result in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company  as customers would receive lower loan amounts for individual pieces of jewelry 
the company believes that many customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount  thus mitigating a portion of this risk
