item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies general a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton  inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september  and  and for the years ended september   and each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap  we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business  the results of our operations and our financial condition  and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements 
the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 
basis of presentation our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton  inc and all of its wholly owned  majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts  transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts  under the requirements of interpretation no 
issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
segment information we report our consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our homebuilding operating regions are our operating segments under sfas no 
and have been aggregated into a single homebuilding reportable segment 
our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling single family housing in states and markets throughout the united states 
our other operating and reporting segment is our financial services segment 
the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets 
we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations 
revenue recognition we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale  when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer 
in situations where the buyer s financing is originated by dhi mortgage  our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary  and the buyer has not made an adequate initial investment as prescribed by sfas no 
 the gross profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed 
virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing 
we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash 
when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers  or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes  upgrades or options related to their homes  we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled 
we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts  depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued  both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third party insurers 
we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses  respectively  along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold 
we sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors 

table of contents some of the loans sold by dhi mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions 
based on historical experience  we estimate and record an allowance for losses related to loans sold with recourse 
in the past  such losses have not been significant 
inventories and cost of sales we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with sfas no 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and home construction  inventory costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction 
applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete  such as utilities  maintenance  and cleaning  are charged to selling  general and administrative sg a expense as incurred 
all indirect overhead costs  such as compensation of construction superintendents  sales personnel and division and region management  advertising and builder s risk insurance are charged to sg a expense as incurred 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs 
cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project 
any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project 
when a home is closed  we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month 
we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home 
we monitor the accuracy of each month s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued 
although actual costs to be paid on closed homes in the future could differ from our current accruals  our method has historically been consistently accurate 
each quarter  we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable 
if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 
guidelines  we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter 
to date  such impairment losses have been insignificant in the aggregate 
fair value estimation under sfas no 
involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and  due to uncertainties in the estimation process  actual results could differ from such estimates 
consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities as amended fin 
fin provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities  which fin defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities 
fin requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both  defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
under such option purchase contracts  we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right  but not the obligation  to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms 
under the terms of the option purchase contracts  many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion 
certain of these deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the requirements of fin as such  certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 
in applying the provisions of fin  we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the 
table of contents variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity 
based on this evaluation  if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract  the variable interest entity is consolidated 
since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin  we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners 
when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing 
in these cases  it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity 
creditors  if any  of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 
warranty costs we have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed 
we estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods 
the one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor  the ten year period is for major construction defects 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
a change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 
insurance claim costs we have  and require the majority of our subcontractors to have  general liability insurance including construction defect coverage and workers compensation insurance 
these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims  subject to certain self insured retentions  deductibles and other coverage limits 
in some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for our subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance  we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors 
we self insure a portion of our overall risk  partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us  naming some subcontractors as additional insureds 
we record expenses and liabilities for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies  based on an analysis of our historical claims  which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
a change in the claim rate or the average cost per claim used to estimate the self insured accruals would not result in a material change in our accrual 
goodwill we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal under its provisions  we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings 
such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption goodwill 
sfas no 
requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded 
we have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units is greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 
require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs 
due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates  actual results could differ from such estimates 

table of contents income taxes we calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  judgment is required 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued staff position  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
the american jobs creation act  which was signed into law in october  provides a tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities 
when fully phased in  the deduction will be up to of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
based on the guidance provided by fsp  this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas no 
and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are deductible on the tax return 
the tax benefit resulting from the new deduction will be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year we are evaluating the impact of this law on our future financial statements  and we currently estimate the future reduction in our federal income tax rate to be in the range of to 
stock based compensation with the approval of our compensation committee  consisting of independent members of our board of directors  we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock 
the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders 
we typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant 
the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period 
we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no

r  share based payment 
this statement  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
 requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
the statement is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r  and we have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations fiscal year overview we generated significant increases in revenues and earnings during the fiscal year ended september   driven primarily by the continued growth of our homebuilding operations and by significant improvements in homebuilding profit margins 
the demand from first time and move up homebuyers in the united states was favorable during fiscal  as national new home sales remained at a historically high level 
additionally  low mortgage rates continued to be a positive influence on housing demand during fiscal however  we believe that the primary drivers of housing demand were local in nature  related to the strength of market specific economic factors such as local job growth  unemployment rates and income growth 
additionally  we believe that the supply of new homes was significantly affected by local factors  such as government approval processes and the availability of land and lots suitable for residential construction 
in a number of markets  increasingly difficult and lengthy governmental approval processes have limited the supply of new housing  which has contributed to new home price appreciation 
due to 
table of contents such local factors  housing demand and supply has varied significantly among markets  which has created differing competitive dynamics for homebuilders in each individual market 
due in part to these factors  the overall us homebuilding industry remains highly fragmented 
however  the industry consolidation that began in the early s continued in in  we continued to execute our strategy of generating consistent  profitable growth through gaining market share  increasing capital allocated to strong homebuilding markets and capitalizing on our national  regional and local scale to improve our material  labor and capital cost structures 
key financial highlights for our fiscal year ended september  were as follows homebuilding operations homebuilding revenues increased by in fiscal and the value of net sales orders grew by 
homebuilding operating margins increased by basis points during fiscal due to improvements in homebuilding gross margins and control of overhead costs 
homebuilding pre tax income increased in fiscal  reflecting a increase in homebuilding gross profit  while overhead costs increased only 
our sales order backlog at september  was billion  a fiscal year end record and higher than our backlog at september  net homebuilding debt to total capital  which is calculated as homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity  was at september   an improvement of basis points from the prior year  and an all time low for the company 
financial services operations total financial services revenues increased in fiscal  driven by the growth in our homebuilding business and an increase in the percentage of our homes closed that were served by dhi mortgage compared to fiscal financial services pre tax income increased by in fiscal  due to increased revenue from loan production and title closings  leveraging our financial services overhead costs and controlling our operating costs 
consolidated results net income increased in fiscal  due to the significant growth in consolidated revenues and improvements in homebuilding and financial services operating margins 
diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in our effective income tax rates in and as compared with were due primarily to increases in pre tax income in states with higher state income tax rates 
our operating strategy for fiscal is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitability through capturing greater market share  while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet 
we plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and entering satellite markets as opportunities are available 
however  we will continue to evaluate homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arise 
to the extent that additional capital is available in excess of amounts we choose to invest in our homebuilding operations  we will consider directing such capital toward alternative uses  including stock 
table of contents repurchases  as market conditions or other circumstances may warrant  within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures

the average price of net sales orders increased in all of our regions except the midwest  where the average sales price was down due to our efforts to offer more lower priced products in the chicago market

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period 
some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies  including mortgage loan approval  which can result in cancellations

capital resources and liquidity we fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities 
as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund the growth of our operations  we have focused on maintaining strong balance sheet leverage ratios 
at september   our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was  an improvement of basis points from at september  net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity 
the improvement reflects a increase in stockholders equity  while net homebuilding debt increased only 
our operating target range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below  so the ratio at september  is well below our targeted operating leverage level 
future fiscal year end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the fiscal year end ratio 
we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders 
we exclude the debt of our financial services business because the business is separately capitalized  its debt is 
table of contents substantially collateralized and our financial services debt is not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 
we include cash because of its capital function 
for comparison  at september  and  our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital were and  respectively 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs including debt maturities through a combination of our existing cash resources  cash flows from operations  our existing or renewed credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public debt markets 
homebuilding capital resources cash at september   our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to  million 
bank credit facility we have a billion unsecured revolving credit facility  which includes a million letter of credit sub facility  that matures on march  the facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 
we borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements  and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the issuance of public debt securities 
we had no outstanding cash borrowings on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at september  and under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility  when we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from moody s investors service  fitch ratings and standard and poor s corporation  our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility  billion at september   or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement 
under the borrowing base limitation  the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory 
at september   the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to billion 
effective november   we now have the two required debt ratings  so the borrowing base limitation is not currently in effect 
at september   we were in compliance with all of the covenants  limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility 
we are currently in negotiations to re finance our revolving credit facility  which we expect will extend the maturity date and increase the capacity of the facility  lower the interest rate spread we must pay on borrowings under the facility and slightly revise certain other terms  covenants  limitations and restrictions under the facility 
we expect the new revolving credit facility to be completed and in effect by december  shelf registration statements at september   we had the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to billion under our universal shelf registration statement 
also  at september   we had the capacity to issue approximately million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement  to effect  in whole or in part  possible future business acquisitions 
debt repayments on april   we repaid the million principal amount of our senior notes which became due on that date 
on july   we redeemed the million principal amount of our senior notes due at an aggregate redemption price of approximately million  plus accrued interest 
the notes were originally issued by schuler homes  inc and were assumed by us in our merger with schuler in february concurrent with the redemption  we recorded interest expense of approximately million  representing the call premium net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes 

table of contents financial services capital resources cash at september   we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of million 
mortgage warehouse loan facility our mortgage subsidiary renewed and amended its million mortgage warehouse loan facility in april  increasing the amount that may be borrowed under the uncommitted accordion provisions to million and extending its maturity to april  our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility  as adjusted by the accordion provisions or otherwise by agreement of the parties  or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement 
under the borrowing base limitation  the amount drawn on our mortgage warehouse loan facility may not exceed of all eligible mortgage loans held for sale and made available to the lenders to secure any borrowings under the facility 
through amendment to the credit agreement in june  we obtained additional commitments from our lenders through the accordion provisions that increased the total commitments under the facility to million 
to provide for fiscal year end closing volume  we obtained temporary commitment increases of million through amendments to the credit agreement in september  which resulted in a total capacity of million at september  through amendments to the credit agreement in october and november  the commitments under the facility were adjusted to million  effective from october  through january  on january   the total capacity will return to million  subject to increase to million should the accordion provisions be implemented again 
at september   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility 
commercial paper conduit facility our mortgage subsidiary also has a million commercial paper conduit facility the cp conduit facility  that expires on june  through amendment to the credit agreement in june  we increased the capacity available under this facility from million to million 
to provide for fiscal year end closing volume  we obtained a temporary increase of million through amendments to the credit agreement in september  which resulted in a total capacity of million at september  the temporary increase was effective through october  when the capacity decreased to million available through november  beginning on november   the total capacity decreased to million 
the terms of the facility are renewable annually by the sponsoring banks 
at september   million was drawn under the cp conduit facility 
in the past  we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale 
although we do not anticipate any problems in renewing or extending these facilities or obtaining temporary additional commitments in the future  the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to do so 
the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility are not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt 
borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale 
the mortgage loans assigned to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multi seller conduits in the commercial paper market 
at september   our total mortgage loans held for sale were  million 
all mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility  the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds 
our mortgage warehouse loan facility and our cp conduit facility contain financial covenants as to our mortgage subsidiary s minimum required tangible net worth  its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required net income 
our mortgage subsidiary is in compliance with each of these covenants 

table of contents operating cash flow activities during the year ended september   we used million of cash in our operating activities  as compared to million during the prior year 
the net cash used in operations in fiscal and was the result of cash provided from net income and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities  offset by cash used to increase residential land  lot and home inventories  mortgage loans held for sale and other assets  reflecting the growth of our homebuilding and financial services operations 
among other factors  the variance in operating cash flows from fiscal to is a result of our decision to invest billion of cash to fund inventory growth in fiscal  versus a billion cash investment in inventory growth in fiscal a large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years 
since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our future growth goals and our market opportunities  we believe that cash flows from operating activities before increases in residential land and lot inventories is currently a better indicator of our liquidity 
investing cash flow activities in fiscal and  cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment  primarily model home furniture and office equipment 
such purchases partially increase with our growth  but they are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows  and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year 
financing cash flow activities the majority of our short term financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and funds available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities 
long term financing needs are typically funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets 
our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 
in october  we issued million of senior notes due we used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes  including land acquisition and development  home construction and homebuilding operations and other working capital needs 
in december  we issued million of senior notes due we used the proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
in february  we issued million of senior notes due we used the proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
in july  we issued million of senior notes due we used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for the early redemption of our senior notes due during fiscal  our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of per common share split adjusted  one quarterly cash dividend of per common share split adjusted  and two quarterly cash dividends of per common share  the last of which was paid on august  to stockholders of record on august  on october   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share  which was paid on october   to stockholders of record on october  changes in capital structure in december  our board of directors declared a three for two stock split effected as a stock dividend  paid on january  to holders of record of our common stock as of december  
table of contents in february  our board of directors declared a four for three stock split effected as a stock dividend  paid on march  to holders of record of our common stock as of march  in july  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and outstanding debt securities  as market conditions warrant 
in may  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and up to million of our outstanding debt securities  representing the amounts then remaining of the authorization 
as of september   we had million remaining of the board of directors authorization for repurchases of common stock and million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities 
on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and up to million of outstanding debt securities  replacing the existing common stock and debt securities repurchase authorization 
contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under short term and long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases 
purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations 
we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows  our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by accessing the capital markets 
our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september  are presented below payments due by period less than more than year years years years total in millions homebuilding notes payable operating leases purchase obligations totals financial services notes payable operating leases totals at september   our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of million and surety bonds of billion  issued by third parties  to secure performance under various contracts 
we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms 
when we complete our performance obligations  the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter  leaving us with no continuing obligations 
we have no material third party guarantees 
to meet the financing needs of our customers  our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments irlcs to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlcs have a duration of less than six months 
some irlcs are 
table of contents committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors 
we manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted irlcs through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbs and the purchase of eurodollar futures contracts edfc on certain loan types 
as of september   our irlcs totaled million  and we had approximately million outstanding of fmbs and edfc and million of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments related to our irlcs 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at september   we had million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of billion  of which only million of the remaining purchase price is subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations 
pursuant to fin  we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of million 
land and lot position and homes in inventory at september   we controlled approximately  lots  of which were lots under option or similar contracts 
the following is a summary of our land lot position at september as of september  lots owned developed and under development lots controlled under lot option and similar contracts total land lots controlled percentage controlled under option the total number of homes under construction was approximately  and  at september  and  respectively 
included in homes under construction at the end of both years  were approximately  model homes and less than unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months 
seasonality we experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements 
we typically have more homes under construction  close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
in fiscal  of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated operating income were attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters 
because the cash generated from our homebuilding operations during these quarters is not available to our financial services segment  we have employed the uncommitted accordion provisions of the segment s credit facilities and sought other temporary commitment increases for this purpose 
any additional temporary financing for our mortgage operations is typically reduced during the first and second quarters of the succeeding fiscal year as we sell our related mortgage portfolio 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

table of contents inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land  financing  labor and material construction costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers 
we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt 
we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings 
we generally do not have an obligation to prepay 
table of contents fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance  repurchase or repay such debt
