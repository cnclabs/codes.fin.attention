overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that markets and sells brand name prescription products 
our current operating plan focuses on maximizing the sales of our existing product portfolio  accelerating growth by launching line extensions to our current products and acquiring or licensing approved products or late stage development products 
we plan to focus on products that fit within the cardiology and women s health categories that will allow us to leverage our existing sales force infrastructure 
we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers who in turn distribute to pharmacies  chain drug stores  other retail merchandisers and  on a limited basis  directly to pharmacies 
we recognize revenue when our products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss 
our sales force targets high prescribing primary care physicians and select specialty physicians 
our sales force seeks to develop close relationships with these physicians and respond to their needs and the needs of their patients 
these physicians  in turn  write prescriptions for our products in order to treat their patients 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts by monitoring prescription trends of our promoted products 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million to million for  compared to million for this increase was primarily the result of management s redefined corporate strategy  which included an increase in sales force from approximately sales professionals to approximately sales professionals and an increased emphasis on hospital and managed care contracts 
these changes resulted in an increase in sular total dispensed prescriptions according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data and the successful launch of prenate elite  the newest member to the prenate family  in april prenate elite has captured of the market share for new prescriptions and of the market share of total prescriptions for the month of december  according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data 
in  revenues were also adversely affected as a result of the company s limitation on sales in order to reduce the level of wholesaler inventory for the first half of the year 
in late  our wholesaler customers purchased what we believe to be excessive levels of inventory of our products in anticipation of future price increases 
this adversely impacted our sales in the first half of as a result of limiting shipments to wholesalers in the first half of and thereby attempting to reduce the amount of inventory held by the wholesalers  unit sales decreased from the first half of compared to the first half of prior to developing systems in  we first learned of the wholesalers increasing the trade levels of inventory in mid december upon receiving the ims health pipeline report  which was a report provided by ims health incorporated that provides information on inventory levels held by certain major wholesalers 
this report indicated that wholesaler inventory levels were higher than we expected 
this additional inventory was purchased by the wholesalers prior to our january product price increases  allowing these wholesaler customers to increase the prices they charge their retail customers in the first quarter of  thereby improving their margins for these products 
in response  in the second and third quarters of  we entered into inventory management agreements with our three largest wholesale customers to encourage the wholesaler s to maintain on average one month of inventory 
net revenues for the year ended december   also included a decrease of million for an accrual for estimated future returns of the tanafed suspension and tanafed dm products which we discontinued in april product overview change in total dispensed prescriptions for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a change in new dispensed prescriptions for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a sular nitrolingual b prenate elite c n a n a tanafed line robinul line ponstel a source ims health s national prescription audit plus data b we believe that ims data does not capture prescriptions of nitrolingual from some of the non retail channels and prescription trends in the non retail channel which may have a significant impact on the reported change 
c prenate elite was launched in april  as a result comparative data is not available for product sales of sular were approximately million for compared to million for the increase was primarily a result of total prescription growth  significant hospital growth  the impact of recent managed care plan additions and price increases 
product sales of the promoted women s health products namely prenate elite  ponstel  the robinul line and the tanafed line  were approximately million for compared to approximately million for the increase was primarily a result of total prescription growth from the launch of prenate elite  significant hospital growth  the impact of recent managed care plan additions and price increases 
in march  we announced that we were launching prenate elite  the next generation of the prenate line of prenatal vitamins 
we began promoting and selling prenate elite in april net revenues of prenate elite were million for the year ended december  prenate elite has captured a market share of of new prescriptions and of total prescriptions as of december  source ims health s national prescription audit plus data  metafolin  is an active form of folate that does not need to be metabolized to the same extent as folic acid 
net revenues of prenate gt and prenate advance were million for the period from january through april when the products were discontinued and million for the year ended december  cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs was due primarily to the increase in net revenues 
as a result of a change in our sales forecast  cost of revenues for the year ended december  included an increased allowance for obsolete and excess inventory of million 
these charges were primarily for our non promoted products  excess sular and tanafed inventory and short dated prenate gt inventory 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  do not include a comparable allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
gross margin 
gross margins for and were 
net sales for included a higher proportion of hospital and managed care prescriptions which have a lower per unit revenue 
this was offset by cost of revenues including the increased allowance for obsolete and excess inventory of million 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  do not include a comparable allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the increase in sales force  increased accounting fees related to the sarbanes oxley requirements  as well as increased royalties related to the increased sales 
this increase was partially offset by lower selling expenses resulting from the company s revised strategy and operating plan 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  to million for compared to million for this increase resulted from higher depreciation expense related to our implementation of a disaster recovery system and a new sales tracking system in impairment charge 
in the second quarter of  the company formulated a new sales and marketing strategy upon the company hiring mr 
patrick fourteau as its then president and chief operating officer 
this new strategy resulted in the discontinuation of the pursuit of a line extension for cognex as well as the subsequent plans to promote the product 
as part of this new strategy  using market research  the company updated its forecasts of cognex sales projections to reflect a life cycle through june  the period of time that the company expects it will continue to sell the product in the future 
as a result  the estimated useful life of cognex was decreased from a remaining life of years to years  and using the estimated future undiscounted cash flows over the useful life of the product  the intangible asset related to cognex was not projected to be recoverable 
to determine a fair value of the intangible asset related to cognex  the company performed an internal analysis utilizing a number of factors  including information from an independent valuation 
the company s analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million being recorded as of june  the methodologies used to determine a fair value for cognex included a combination of a market approach  which used a marketable multiple methodology and a comparable transaction methodology  as well as an income approach  using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the company believes there are no other intangible asset impairments and there were no other asset write downs as of december  research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense is primarily a result of costs incurred in associated with manufacturing transfers for our ponstel  cognex and furadantin products and development costs for the prenate line 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  do not include comparable expenses 
in late  the fda issued a notice about various cough and cold combination products  which we believe requires us to obtain fda approval of our tanafed products before january  in order to be able to thereafter continue to market and sell these products as prescription products 
in october  the fda issued a draft guidance document to address their current approach to handling compliance issues for drugs marketed without fda approval 
we have not yet determined the estimated cost to obtain fda approval 
we are performing early phase clinical trials that are required for fda approval regardless of the eventual prescription versus over the counter status 
based on the findings of the planned phase trial  we will finalize our development strategy and seek a pre ind meeting with the fda 
we may incur significant developmental expenses to obtain fda approval or may begin marketing tanafed products as non prescription products  which could have a material adverse effect on net revenues and profit margins for the tanafed product line 
interest expense 
interest expense was million year for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the issuance of a total of million  senior subordinated contingent convertible notes in march for the year ended december   the company had no debt outstanding 
in march  we issued a total of million  contingent convertible senior subordinated notes 
the notes are due march  and accrued interest is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  commencing on september  in addition to the interest on the notes  after march   we will also pay contingent interest during specified six month periods if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
during any period when contingent interest is payable  it will be payable at a rate equal to per annum 
the net proceeds from this issuance after deducting offering expenses were approximately million 
the holders of the convertible notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments  before the close of business on march  holders may convert their convertible notes only under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter commencing after june   if the closing sales price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  if the notes have been called for redemption  during the five trading day period immediately following any nine consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the notes per  principal amount for each day of that period was less than of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  or the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
we have the option to redeem the notes beginning march  at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
the holders of the notes have the option to require us to repurchase the notes on march of  and  and upon a change in control  at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income for year ended december  is primarily due to a higher average cash and marketable securities balances as a result of the proceeds from the issuance of the contingent convertible senior subordinated notes in march  as well as positive cash flows generated from operations during benefit provision for income taxes 
income taxes were provided for at a rate of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in the effective rate for the year ended december  is due to the change in the mix of tax jurisdictions  both domestic and international as a result of our implementation of international operations where our income was earned  as well as a change in the ratio of non deductible expenses to pre tax income 
years ended december  and december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million to for  compared to for this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in net revenues of million or of our promoted products as a result of the company s limitation on sales in order to reduce the levels of wholesaler customer inventories for a majority of our promoted products including sular  nitrolingual  tanafed dp  ponstel and robinul in late  our wholesaler customers purchased what we believe to be excessive levels of inventory of our products in anticipation of future price increases 
this adversely impacted our sales in the first half of as a result of limiting shipments to wholesalers in the first half of and thereby attempting to reduce the amount of inventory held by the wholesalers  unit sales decreased from the first half of compared to the first half of prior to developing systems in to track wholesaler inventory levels  we first learned of the wholesalers increasing the trade levels of inventory in mid december upon receiving the ims health pipeline report which was a report provided by ims health incorporated that provides information on inventory levels held by certain major wholesalers 
this report indicated that wholesaler inventory levels as of the end of november were higher than expected by the company 
this additional inventory was purchased by the wholesalers prior to our january price increases  allowing these wholesaler customers to increase the prices they charge their retail customers in the first quarter of  thereby improving their margins for these products 
in response  in the second and third quarters of  we entered into inventory management agreements with our three largest wholesale customers to provide incentive to the wholesalers to maintain on average one month of inventory 
trade levels of our promoted products were approximately one month at december  a million or decline in sales of our non promoted products as a result of the continuing decline in prescription trends  which was caused by a number of factors including substitution from generic and over the counter products 
a reduction of recorded liability for estimated product returns of million in compared to million in  which resulted in an increase in net revenues 
in connection with the acquisition of rights for robinul  ponstel  cognex  prenate  furadantin and sular  we assumed certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the respective acquisition dates  we estimated the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and included that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we periodically review the estimated liability and reduce it if actual returns have been lower than expected 
generally  no adjustment is made to the reserve until two to three years subsequent to the acquisition due to the lag time between when a product is sold and when it is returned 
a decrease in net revenues of million resulting from a reduction in the accrual for estimated future returns of our tanafed suspension products  in compared to million in in september  we launched tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  line extensions to our tanafed suspension and tanafed dm products 
these line extensions were launched in response to increasing competition by knock off products to tanafed suspension and tanafed dm 
due to the launch of tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  we expected increased returns of tanafed suspension  as prescriptions were expected to be filled with the line extensions 
we estimated returns of approximately million and provided for this amount in in april  we decided to withdraw tanafed suspension and tanafed dm from the market 
the decision to withdraw tanafed suspension in april was earlier than planned 
additionally  we also decided to withdraw tanafed dm 
as a result  we expected to incur an additional million in returns of tanafed suspension and tanafed dm and provided for that amount in the results of operations for a reduction in the recorded liability for medicaid rebates  of million in  which had the effect of increasing net revenues 
in connection with the acquisition of rights for sular  we became responsible for medicaid rebates for product sales after the acquisition date 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  any rebate invoices received by the seller would be paid by the seller and reimbursed by first horizon 
when we began selling sular in march  we began accruing for these medicaid rebates and reviewed the accrual on a quarterly basis 
the rebate accrual rate was developed using historical information provided by the seller 
from march to december  we had accrued a liability of approximately million which was a reasonable accounting estimate considering actual historical information obtained from the seller 
in december  as a result of a negotiation between the parties  the seller requested reimbursement of million 
as a result  we signed a settlement agreement with the seller for the payment of million and we were relieved of all obligations related to the medicaid rebates for sular and  accordingly  we reduced our liability for medicaid rebates for sular and increased revenue 
product overview change in total dispensed prescriptions for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a sular nitrolingual b prenate line tanafed line robinul line ponstel a source ims health s national prescription audit plus data b we believe that ims data does not capture prescriptions of nitrolingual from some of the non retail channels and prescription trends in the non retail channel which may have a significant impact on the reported change 
product sales of sular  excluding the reversal of medicaid rebate liability of million  were approximately million for compared to million for we acquired sular in march this decline in product sales was primarily the result of the reduction in trade levels of sular held by our wholesaler customers during product sales of the promoted women s health products namely the prenate line  the tanafed line  the robinul line and ponstel  were approximately million for compared to approximately million for this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in trade levels of inventory during and lower sales of the prenate line due to increased substitution of knock off products by pharmacies 
commencing during the second quarter of  we experienced significant erosion of prenate gt sales due to increased substitution of knock off products by pharmacies filling prescriptions for prenate gt 
according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data  substitution rates as measured by total dispensed prescriptions captured by prenate gt and knock off products were for the quarter ended december  compared to for the quarter ended december  as part of our operational plan of maximizing sales of our existing products  we explored new line extensions for the prenate line in an effort to reduce this substitution rate 
product sales of nitrolingual decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in trade levels of inventory during the year partially offset by price increases taken during during the second quarter of  we launched a dose application bottle of nitrolingual 
the dose bottle is smaller and more convenient to carry for some patients than the currently marketed dose bottle 
we believe that the dose bottle will benefit patients who have mild angina and whose episodes are occasional 
we believe the smaller bottle is an excellent companion product to the dose bottle 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased million to million for compared to million in cost of revenues includes an increase to our allowance for excess and obsolete inventory of million in compared to in these charges in were primarily for our non promoted products  excess sular and tanafed inventory and short dated prenate gt inventory 
in  the charges were the result of tanafed suspension inventory becoming obsolete due to the launch of line extensions and lower than expected sales of prenate gt 
gross margin for was compared to for this increase in gross margin was primarily the result of a change in product sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for  compared to million for selling related expenses decreased due to lower co promotion expenses incurred for promotion of our sular product due to the termination of a co promotion agreement in the second quarter of  as well as lower selling expense as a result of our revised operating plan 
the decrease was partially offset  by increased expenses for an allowance for obsolete sample inventory  shipping cost related to the withdrawal of tanafed suspension and tanafed dm and severance for departing employees 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  to million for compared to million for this increase resulted from higher amortization expense related to the acquisition of sular in march and higher depreciation expense related to our implementation of new financial systems in impairment charge 
in the second quarter of  the company formulated a new sales and marketing strategy upon the company hiring mr 
patrick fourteau as its then president and chief operating officer 
this new strategy resulted in the discontinuation of the pursuit of a line extension for cognex as well as the subsequent plans to promote the product

the company s analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million being recorded as of june  the methodologies used to determine a fair value for cognex included a combination of a market approach  which used a marketable multiple methodology and a comparable transaction methodology  as well as an income approach  using a discounted cash flow methodology 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased million to million for compared to million for the increase in expense is primarily a result of costs associated with manufacturing transfers for our ponstel  cognex and furadantin products and development costs for the prenate line

we were performing early phase clinical trials that were required for fda approval regardless of the eventual prescription versus over the counter status 
based on the findings of the planned phase trial  we would finalize our development strategy and seek a pre ind meeting with the fda 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for compared to million for we had no debt outstanding in interest expense in was the result of amortization of capitalized loan costs and unused facility fees relating to our million line of credit 
interest expense in was primarily the result of a credit facility obtained in march to finance the acquisition of sular 
we repaid all indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility in the second quarter of and terminated this credit facility in july as a result of sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections results for have been reclassified to state what was previously reported as an extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of million net of taxes 
to make this reclassification  interest expense for has been increased by million and the income tax provision was decreased by million 
interest income 
interest income was million for  compared to million for the decrease in interest income is primarily due to a lower average cash balance in benefit provision for income taxes 
income taxes were provided for at a rate of for  compared to the decrease in the effective rate is due primarily to the change in the ratio of non deductible expenses to pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from working capital requirements  product development activities  funding of acquisitions and debt service 
we expect to need additional funds to acquire or obtain licenses for new products  develop and test new products and potentially to acquire other businesses  which may increase our cost of capital 
we may seek funding through public and private financing and may seek to incur debt  issue shares of our stock  or both  either to finance a transaction or as consideration for a transaction 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether through the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available when we need them or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds could cause us to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product acquisitions  licensing opportunities  marketing programs  product development programs  potential business acquisitions and manufacturing opportunities 
we have historically met these cash requirements through cash from operations  borrowings and the issuance of common stock 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this providing of cash resulted from the net income for the year of million  non cash depreciation and amortization of million  non cash tax transactions of million  increase in accounts payable of million  increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million and non cash interest expense of million 
these providers of cash were partially offset by the increases in accounts receivable of million  other current assets and other assets of million  inventories of million and income taxes receivable of million 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this use of cash resulted from the net loss for the year of million  decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million and in accounts payable of million and an increase in income taxes receivable of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the cognex impairment charge of million  non cash depreciation and amortization of million  non cash tax transactions of million  non cash deferred compensation of million  and decreases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million  and other current assets and other assets of million 
we maintain supply agreements with third party suppliers for all of our products 
some of these supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements 
for most of these supply agreements  we believe that our inventory requirements and related purchases of inventory will exceed the minimum purchase requirement in in those cases in which we do not believe our purchases will exceed the minimum purchase requirements  we are seeking to negotiate waivers or modifications of the minimum purchase requirements 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  which was million 
the primary use of cash for investing activities was the purchase of marketable securities of million 
in addition  another use of investing cash during the second quarter of  we announced an agreement with skyepharma plc  granting us the exclusive license to market and distribute a cardiovascular product in the united states 
the agreement required us to pay million to skyepharma plc upon signing the agreement and up to an additional million is payable thereafter all of which are contingent upon milestones related to fda approval 
the product has been submitted to the fda for approval  and the agreement calls for approval to be completed by june we intend to begin marketing and distribution shortly after receipt of the fda approval 
we have incurred an additional million in acquisition costs related to the skyepharma plc agreement 
we also used million for the purchase of property and equipment  primarily for a new sales force automation system 
our business strategy includes the acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products that we believe represent attractive growth opportunities for us in the future 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
subject to our liquidity and capital resources at any particular time  we may incur commitments in the future to acquire or license pharmaceutical products 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the purchase of marketable securities of million 
in addition  we purchased million of property and equipment in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash used by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the primary provider of cash from financing activities was the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million and from the issuance of common stock  primarily from the exercise of stock options  of million 
these providers of cash were offset by million in incurred financing costs related to the debt issuance  million for the repurchase of common stock which was subsequently retired and million for the acquisition of treasury stock which was acquired in part  to establish a pool of authorized shares that will be available for contribution to the employee stock ownership plan over time as the company in its discretion deems appropriate 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  we repurchased million worth of our common stock under our share repurchase program 
we also incurred million of capitalized financing costs in association with our million revolving credit facility 
these uses of cash were offset by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
these shares were issued primarily as a result of option exercises 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash we expect to generate from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund these working capital requirements  at least for the next twelve months 
however  in the event that we make significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities  or both 
our purchase of inventory impacts our liquidity 
during  we expect to invest cash in the purchase of inventory 
some of our supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements 
we do not expect that meeting those requirements will result in the acquisition of excessive inventory 
we expect we will also experience growth in our accounts receivable as our sales increase 
in march  we issued a total of million of our contingent convertible senior subordinated notes 
the notes are due march  and accrued interest is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  commencing on september  in addition to the interest in the notes  after march   we will also pay contingent interest during specified six month periods if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
during any period when contingent interest is payable  it will be payable at a rate equal to per annum 
the net proceeds from this issuance after deducting offering expenses were approximately million

as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
as of march  and june   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of the credit agreement

the company acquired those shares in part  to establish a pool of authorized shares that will be available for contribution to the company s employee stock ownership plan over time as the company in its discretion deems appropriate 
we expect that our existing sources of working capital or liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to execute our main operational goals of maximizing the sales of our existing products and acquiring companies having such products  accelerating growth by launching line extensions to our current products and acquiring or licensing approved products or late stage development products

inventory purchase obligations are based on the unit contractual obligations at the unit cost as of december  unit prices are subject to increase upon notification by the supplier in the event of increased costs incurred by the supplier 
long term debt obligations do not include interest payments of million per year 
contractual obligations do not include certain contingent payments related to milestones on licensing and purchasing agreements  as the conditions for payment have not been met 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
inflation we have experienced only moderate price increases under our agreements with third party manufacturers as a result of raw material and labor price increases 
we have generally passed these price increases along to our customers 
seasonality although our business is generally non seasonal  sales of certain products  such as cough and cold products  increase between october and march due to the cold and flu season 
we expect the impact of seasonality to decrease as we acquire or obtain licenses for products that treat chronic conditions 
however  we anticipate that the seasonality may continue to affect sales for the foreseeable future 
sales of our cough and cold products accounted for of our total sales in critical accounting policies we view our critical accounting policies to be those policies which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to estimate the level of accounts receivable recorded on our balance sheet which will ultimately not be paid 
among other things  this assessment requires analysis of the financial strength of our customers  which can be highly subjective  particularly in the recent difficult general economic environment 
our policy is to estimate bad debt expense based on prior experience supplemented by a periodic customer specific review when needed 
if we over or under estimate the level of accounts receivable that will not be paid  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
sales deductions 
we provide volume rebates  contractual price reductions with drug wholesalers and insurance companies  and certain other sales related deductions on a regular basis 
the exact level of these deductions is not always immediately known and thus we must record an estimate at the time of sale 
our estimates are based on historical experience with similar programs  and since we have a relatively small customer base  customer specific historical experience is often useful in determining the estimated level of deductions expected to be refunded to our customers when sales incentives are offered 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales deductions  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
our return policy conforms to industry standard practices 
we believe that we have sufficient data to estimate future returns over the revised time period at the time of sale 
management is required to estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
management periodically reviews the reserves established for returns and adjusts them based on actual experience 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
liabilities assumed with the acquisition of product rights 
in connection with the acquisition of product rights  we assume certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  we estimate the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and include that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we review the estimated liability on an annual basis 
if we over or under estimate liabilities assumed  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
when we acquire the rights to manufacture and sell a product  we record the aggregate purchase price  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
we use the assistance of valuation experts to help us allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets that we have acquired 
then  we must estimate the economic useful life of each of these intangible assets in order to amortize their cost as an expense in our statement of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related asset 
the factors that drive the actual economic useful life of a pharmaceutical product are inherently uncertain  and include patent protection  physician loyalty and prescribing patterns  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  future introductions of competing products not yet fda approved  the impact of promotional efforts and many other issues 
we use all of these factors in initially estimating the economic useful lives of our products  and we also continuously monitor these factors for indications of appropriate revisions 
in assessing the recoverability of its intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we review intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances may include but are not limited to  lack of promotional sensitivity  the introduction of competitive products and changes in government regulations 
if we determine that an intangible asset is impaired  a non cash impairment charge would be recognized 
if we should incur an impairment loss  there may be a material impact to the financial statements 
on march   we acquired certain us rights relating to sular for an aggregate purchase price of million 
with the assistance of valuation experts  we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets which we acquired as part ofthe transaction 
in addition  we assigned useful lives to acquired intangible assets which are not deemed to have an indefinite life 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of sular are being amortized over periods ranging from five to twenty years with a weighted average amortization period of nineteen years 
in light of our experience in in promoting sular  we carefully evaluated the useful lives assigned to the intangible assets acquired in the sular acquisition and whether or not any impairment of any such assets was indicated 
our best estimate is that the useful lives assigned to the sular intangible assets remain appropriate 
our estimate of such useful lives is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
among these risks and uncertainties is our ability to develop one or more new versions of the product  obtain approval from the fda to market and sell such newly developed product and procure patent protection for that product before the expiration of the last to expire of the existing patents related to sular in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets states that an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the undiscounted future cash flows of sular as estimated by us over the remaining useful life of the product exceed the carrying amount of the sular asset and therefore the carrying amount is estimated to be recoverable 
however  the amount recorded as intangible assets on first horizon s balance sheet for the sular assets may be more or less than the fair value of such assets 
determining the fair value of the sular intangible asset is inherently uncertain  and may be dependent in significant part on the success of our revised plans to promote sular 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in international  federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
inventory obsolescence 
our products have shelf lives ranging from to months 
we must estimate the amount of inventory recorded on our balance sheet that will not be sold prior to expiration 
this estimate requires analysis of forecasted demand for our products  our promotional focus  amounts of our products currently held by our customers and the impact on our products of competing products 
if we over or under estimate the amount of inventory that will not be sold prior to expiration  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no

these shares were only included in the diluted earnings per share computation if the company s common stock price has reached certain conversion trigger prices 
eitf also requires the company to retroactively restate its prior periods diluted earnings per share 
eitf is effective for periods ending after december  upon adoption  eitf had no impact on the company s diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and december   but it did reduce the company s diluted earnings per share by for the year ended december  in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
the application of this guidance should be used to determine when an investment is considered impaired  whether an impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired is effective for evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after june  in september  the fasb issued fsp  effective date of paragraphs of eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment  which delayed certain provisions of eitf until the fasb issues further implementation guidance 
the application of this consensus did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
during december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no

the issuance of sab no 
did not impact the company s accounting policy for revenue recognition 
during december  the fasb issued sfas no

did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that arise in the ordinary course of business 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure is presented below 
foreign currency exchange risk our purchases of nitrolingual under our agreement with pohl boskamp and our purchases of sular product inventory from bayer are made in euros 
although we did not enter into any forward contracts in  we may eliminate risks from foreign currency fluctuations after the time of shipment of product by entering into forward contracts for these purchases of inventory at the time of product shipments 
while the effect of foreign currency translations has not been material to our results of operations to date  currency translations on export sales or import purchases could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
market risk on investments the fair value of our investment portfolio would be negatively affected by an increase in interest rates 
since the majority of the company s investments are fixed rate interest bearing securities and therefore subject to the market risk of loss in market value from an increase in rates or a change in the underlying risk of the issuers of the notes  the company s future earnings and cash flows could be affected adversely if the company were to sell the securities prior to their maturity date 
there were no realized gains or losses from sale of investments in the year ended december  at december   the company had total net unrealized losses from marketable securities of million 
market risk on variable rate debt in connection with borrowings incurred under the senior secured revolving credit facility arranged by lasalle bank  na  we could experience market risk with respect to changes in the general level of the interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at variable rates 
because such rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
accordingly  our present exposure to interest rate fluctuations is primarily dependent on rate changes that may occur while borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are outstanding 
as of february  there was no debt outstanding under this facility 
market risk on fixed rate debt the company s long term fixed interest rate senior subordinated contingent convertible notes are also subject to market risk 
fixed rate debt outstanding at december  was million with an interest rate of 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt will increase as rates decline and will decrease as rates rise 
the fixed rate notes outstanding totaling million at december  had a fair value of million based on quoted market rates
