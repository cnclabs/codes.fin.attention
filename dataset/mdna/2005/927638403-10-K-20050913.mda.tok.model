our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following whether we are able to secure sufficient funding to maintain our operations  complete clinical trials and successfully market our product and otherwise continue as a going concern  whether our stock price will enable us to conduct future financings  whether the efficacy  price and timing of our natural human alpha interferon will enable us to compete with other well established  highly capitalized  biopharmaceutical companies  whether clinical testing confirms the efficacy of our product  and results in the receipt of regulatory approvals 
we have not sought the approval of our natural human alpha interferon product from the us food and drug administration or its european union counterparts  except sweden  whether our patent applications result in the issuance of patents  or whether patents and other intellectual property rights provide adequate protections in the event of misappropriation or infringement by third parties  whether our avian transgenics program succeeds in producing targeted drugs in egg whites of transgenic chickens in commercially viable quantities  whether  despite receipt of regulatory approvals  our products are accepted as a treatment superior to that of our competitors  and whether we can generate revenue sufficient to offset our historical losses and achieve profitability 

table of contents our natural human alpha interferon product was developed and is manufactured overseas in our swedish facility 
our avian transgenic and oncology programs are also being researched and developed in europe 
our dependence on foreign manufacturing and expected international sales exposes us to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  including import and export restrictions  political or economic instability  compliance with foreign laws  transportation delays and interruptions  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in foreign countries  and currency exchange risks 
viragen has incurred operational losses and operated with negative cash flows since its inception in december net losses have totaled approximately million  million and million  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we believe we have enough cash to support our operations through at least december  however  we will require substantial additional funding to support our operations subsequent to that date 
as we do not anticipate achieving sufficient cash flows from operations by december   our plans include obtaining additional capital through equity and debt financings 
as we can not provide any assurance that additional capital will be obtainable when required  these conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  depreciation  amortization  asset valuation allowances  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventories 
inventories consist of raw materials and supplies  work in process and finished product 
finished product consists of purified natural human alpha interferon that is available for sale 
costs of raw materials and supplies is determined on a first in  first out basis 
costs of work in process and finished product consisting of raw materials  labor and overhead are recorded at a standard cost which approximates actual cost 
excess idle capacity costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and are recorded in cost of sales 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value 
if the cost of our inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on estimates 
the valuation of our inventories also requires us to estimate excess inventories and inventories that are not saleable 
the determination of excess or non saleable inventories requires us to estimate the future demand for our product and consider the shelf life of the inventory 
if actual demand is less than our estimated demand  we could be required to record inventory write downs  which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

table of contents long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
as of the date of the financial statements included in this annual report  we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment arise 
management has selected april st as the date of our annual impairment review 
all of our goodwill arose from the acquisition of viranative on september  and the subsequent achievement of certain milestones defined in the acquisition agreement 
we periodically evaluate that acquired business for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and the operational performance of the acquired business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the impairment review indicated that our goodwill was impaired and an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded 
changes in the estimates used to conduct our impairment review  including revenue projections or market values  could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is further impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
stock based compensation 
our employee stock option plans are currently accounted for under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we grant stock options to employees and directors to purchase a fixed number of shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
in accordance with apb  we recognize no compensation expense for these stock option grants 
we account for our stock based compensation arrangements with non employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related guidance  including emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accordingly  we recognize as expense the estimated fair value of such instruments as calculated using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimated fair value is re determined each quarter using the methodologies allowable by sfas no 
and eitf no 
and the expense is amortized over the vesting period of each option or the recipient s contractual arrangement  if shorter 
convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants viragen accounts for convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants  eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
the determination of the relative fair value of the components of our convertible notes and debentures issued with common stock purchase warrants requires the use of estimates 
changes in those estimates would result in different relative values being attributed to the components  which could result in more discount on the principal amount of the debentures 
modifications to the terms of outstanding convertible notes could also require us to adjust the relative fair value of the components of our convertible notes  which could result in additional discount on the principal amount of the debentures 
this additional discount would result in additional non cash interest expense over the life of the convertible notes 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of our natural human alpha interferon product when title and risk of loss has been transferred  which is generally upon shipment 
moreover  recognition requires persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
litigation and other contingencies 
we monitor the status of our litigation and other contingencies for purposes of loss accrual 
if we believed a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we would establish an appropriate accrual 
we would base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
information may become available to us after that time  for which additional accruals may be required 
liquidity and capital resources we do not have enough cash or working capital to meet our operating requirements through the end of fiscal as of june   we had approximately million in cash down from approximately million as of june  as of june   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  compared to working capital of approximately million as of june  the change in working capital is primarily attributed to the reclassification of our convertible notes due march  totaling approximately million from long term to short term at march  cash used to fund operations during the fiscal year ended june  totaled approximately million  while financing expenditures  including the repayment of our line of credit and short term borrowings and long term debt  totaled approximately million 
we have experienced losses and a negative cash flow from operations since inception 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we incurred significant losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of june  we anticipate additional future losses as we commercialize our natural human alpha interferon product and conduct additional research activities and clinical trials to obtain additional regulatory approvals 
we believe we have sufficient cash to support operations  including those of our subsidiaries  through at least december  however  we will require substantial additional funding to support our operations subsequent to december  as we do not anticipate achieving sufficient cash flows from operations by december   our plans include seeking additional capital through equity and debt financings 
no assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when required or upon terms acceptable to us 
our inability to generate substantial revenue or obtain additional capital through equity or debt financings would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to continue operations 
additionally  while we are currently in negotiations to extend and otherwise restructure our million june note financing  we can not assure you that these negotiations will be successful 
as a result of these financial conditions  the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our june  consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during the fiscal year ended june   we received a contribution in the amount of million from a business development agency in sweden 
this contribution was awarded in connection with our capital investment in our renovated facility in ume  sweden  which was completed during our fiscal year ended june  this contribution was recorded as a reduction of the cost of the building improvements 
we could be required to repay a portion of this contribution if we do not meet certain conditions under the award  including  but not limited to  keeping the facility in operation 
the amount we could be required to repay decreases on an annual basis beginning in july after july  we could only be required to repay of the award 
upon the second  third and fourth anniversary  the repayment amount decreases to  and  respectively  of the award 
at this time  we do not believe we will be required to repay any portion of the contribution 

table of contents june convertible notes on april   we entered into purchase agreements for the issuance and sale of convertible notes and common stock purchase warrants in the aggregate amount of million 
the notes were placed with a group of new and returning institutional investors 
the million purchase price for the notes and warrants was placed in escrow pending satisfaction of all conditions precedent to closing  including receipt of stockholder approval for the sale of the notes and warrants  as well as a one for ten reverse split of our common stock 
on june   our stockholders voted to approve the sale of the notes  the one for ten reverse split of our common stock and a change in the number of the authorized shares of our common stock to million shares 
on june   we completed the sale of the notes and warrants 
under the terms of these agreements  we received approximately million  net of finder s fees and legal expenses 
these agreements also provided for the issuance to the purchasers of an aggregate of  three year common stock purchase warrants exercisable at per share 
these convertible notes mature on march  the notes are convertible by the investors  in whole or in part  into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to 
this conversion price is subject to reductions if we enter into additional financing transactions for the sale of our stock below the public trading price and below the conversion price 
these notes may be prepaid at of their face amount  plus the issuance to note holders of additional warrants to purchase the number of shares of our common stock into which the notes would otherwise have been convertible  at an exercise price equal to the prevailing conversion price of the notes 
if issued on prepayment  the warrants may be exercised for the period that would have been the remaining life of the notes had they not been prepaid 
commencing one year after issuance  we also have the right to require note holders to convert their notes  subject to certain limitations  provided that our common stock has traded at or more of the conversion price of the notes on each of the trading days ending five days prior to the date fixed for conversion 
as of june   the entire principal amount of these convertible notes of million remained outstanding 
interest payable on the convertible notes is payable in cash or shares of our common stock at our option 
the value of shares used to satisfy the interest payment equals the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days prior to the interest payment date 
for the fiscal year ended june  we paid interest on the notes of  in cash and  through the issuance of shares of our common stock valued at per share 
line of credit and short term borrowings our swedish subsidiary maintains an overdraft facility  denominated in swedish krona  with a bank in sweden 
in july  the terms on this overdraft facility were renegotiated to provide for a reduced interest rate and a reduction in the maximum borrowing capacity 
the maximum borrowing capacity on this overdraft facility was approximately  as of june  compared to million as of june  borrowings outstanding under this facility are at a floating rate of interest  which was approximately at june  compared to at june  this overdraft facility renews annually and was renewed in december there was no outstanding balance under this overdraft facility as of june  outstanding borrowings under this overdraft facility were approximately  as of june  the overdraft facility is secured by certain assets of viranative including inventories and accounts receivable 
during june  we obtained short term financing of approximately  for the purchase of certain corporate insurance policies 
outstanding borrowings under this arrangement bear interest at an effective rate of 
principal and interest payments of approximately  are payable in nine equal monthly installments 
the outstanding balance on this short term borrowing was approximately  as of june  during june  we obtained short term financing of approximately  for the purchase of certain corporate insurance policies 
this short term financing had been repaid as of march  
table of contents long term debt our swedish subsidiary has a year mortgage with a swedish bank obtained to purchase one of our facilities in sweden 
the outstanding principal balance on this loan  which is payable in swedish krona  was approximately  and  at june  and  respectively 
this loan carries a floating rate of interest which was approximately at june  and we are required to make quarterly payments of principal and interest of approximately  under this agreement 
this loan matures in september and is secured by the related land and building  including improvements  with a carrying value of approximately million as of june  under the terms of a loan with a swedish governmental agency that was obtained for the purposes of conducting clinical trials  we were required to make quarterly payments of principal and interest of approximately  the loan carried a floating rate of interest at the stockholm interbank offered rate stibor plus  which was approximately as of june  this loan had an outstanding balance  which was payable in swedish krona  of approximately  at june  on september   we paid the entire outstanding principal  including accrued interest  on this loan 
no amounts are due on this loan as of june  our future cash requirements are dependent upon many factors  including restructuring the terms of our million notes due march   revenue generated from the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product  market conditions and our ability to service our convertible debt  progress with future clinical trials  the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in patent applications  competing technologies and market developments  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and effective commercialization activities 
we believe that our natural human alpha interferon product can be manufactured in sufficient quantity and be priced at a level to offer non responding patients a reasonable attractive alternative treatment to the synthetic interferons currently being marketed 
however  we can not assure you of the success of our commercialization efforts and other projects 
required regulatory approvals are subject to the successful completion of lengthy and costly clinical trials 
the successful commercialization of multiferon r and the completion of required clinical trials and facility expansions depend on our ability to raise significant additional funding

table of contents as of the date of this annual report  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations 
these transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states

royalties represent royalties due to medicore according to settlement reached in july 
table of contents results of operations compared to product sales for the fiscal year ended june   product sales totaled approximately  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  this five percent increase in product sales of approximately  is attributed to an increase in sales of multiferon in sweden and south africa  which was partially offset by decreases in indonesia and mexico 
the timing and size of orders placed by our distributors can have a significant impact on our product sales for a particular period 
this is expected for markets in which we have recently launched multiferon 
as these markets develop  we can expect a more consistent trend in orders and thus product sales 
of the  in total product sales in fiscal  approximately occurred in the last two fiscal quarters 
we have entered into several agreements for the distribution of our natural human alpha interferon  multiferon  in various countries 
to date  we have not recognized significant revenue from many of these agreements 
the majority of these agreements require that the distributor obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  which may not yet be obtained 
regulatory approval is a mandatory step in the marketing of a drug  but it is by no means the final challenge in marketing a biopharmaceutical product 
in many countries  a separate process may be required for obtaining reimbursement authorization  physicians must be educated about the merits of the product over time  and in some of these territories  hospital formularies govern the acceptance for use of a new product 
there are other challenges associated with international marketing activities including language and cultural barriers  poorly organized regulatory infrastructure and or compliance procedures in certain countries where multiferon may be marketed  performance of our distribution channels  government s willingness to promote cheaper generic versions of competing products and the general population s inability to afford private care drug products 
it may take significant time to overcome these challenges with no assurance that a particular market will ever be effectively penetrated 
cost of sales cost of sales  which includes excess idle production costs  totaled approximately million for the year ended june  compared to approximately million for the year ended june  the increases in cost of sales for the year ended june  is primarily attributed to increased excess idle capacity 
excess idle capacity represents fixed production costs incurred at our swedish manufacturing facilities  which were not absorbed as a result of the production of inventory at less than normal operating levels 
for the year ended june   excess idle capacity costs were due to minimal production activities as a result of low sales demand 
for the year ended june   the excess idle capacity costs were the result of the suspension of routine manufacturing as of march  this planned break in routine manufacturing was dictated by the swedish regulatory authorities and was necessary to allow for certain steps of our production process to be segregated and transferred to our owned facility located in ume  sweden 
we will continue to incur excess idle production costs until we generate higher sales demand and resume production at normal operating levels that absorb our fixed production costs 

table of contents inventory write down during fiscal  we recorded write downs of approximately  of our finished product inventory 
upon evaluating the shelf life of certain lots of our multiferon inventory  near term sales forecasts and consideration of alternative uses  write downs of the value of this inventory were deemed necessary 
the remaining cost of finished goods inventory at june  is approximately  and we anticipate the use of this inventory for sales in the near future 
the determination of excess or non saleable inventories requires us to estimate the future demand for our product and consider the shelf life of the inventory 
if actual demand is less than our estimated demand  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our inventory is classified as work in process 
included in work in process is approximately  of inventory that has been filled in ampoules  but that is pending final release by regulatory authorities  which is expected in the first or second quarter of fiscal we currently anticipate the use of these ampoules prior to their shelf life expiration  which is up to three years from june  the remainder of work in process is approximately million of purified multiferon that has not yet been filled into ampoules or syringes 
subsequent to june   a freezer at our facility in sweden malfunctioned causing the temperature of a portion of this purified multiferon to rise above the approved levels for frozen product 
we will be unable to utilize this particular inventory for commercial use and a write down of approximately  reduced by related insurance recovery  if any  will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal we currently anticipate we will fill the remainder of our purified multiferon into ampoules and or syringes prior to shelf life expiration  which ranges from nine to fifteen months from june  research and development costs research and development costs include scientific salaries and support fees  product used for clinical trials  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  contracted research and development  equipment rentals  repairs and maintenance  utilities and research related travel 
for the year ended june   research and development costs totaled approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase of approximately million was attributed to an increase in costs incurred related to our antibody projects totaling approximately million and an increase in consulting fees  licensing fees and other expenses related to multiferon 
these increases were partially offset by the reversal of a long standing trade liability of approximately million during the quarter ended december  we will continue incurring research and development costs  including projects associated with multiferon as well as other projects to more fully develop potential commercial applications of our natural human alpha interferon product  as well as broaden our potential product lines in the areas of avian transgenics and oncology 
we anticipate expenditures to increase over the next twelve months  particularly in the area of regulatory related consulting fees and manufacturing of our development products 
our ability to successfully conclude additional clinical trials  a prerequisite for expanded commercialization of any biopharmaceutical product  is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional funding necessary to conduct and complete these trials or our ability to secure a partner with whom to conduct these trials 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel salaries and related expenses  office and equipment leases  utilities  repairs and maintenance  insurance  legal  accounting  consulting  depreciation and amortization expenses 
for the year ended june   selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase of approximately million is primarily attributed to increases in personnel related costs  consulting fees  and accounting fees  primarily associated to efforts necessary to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  at our florida headquarters of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that selling related expenses will increase in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is expected due to the planned expansion of our multiferon sales efforts 
these increases will be incurred in sales personnel related expenses  consulting fees  travel related expenses  promotional materials and other marketing related costs 
impairment of goodwill statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
due to a lack of significant revenues from our natural interferon product and a longer than anticipated timeframe to receive regulatory approvals in certain markets  revenue and cash flows for the viranative reporting unit were lower than expected in fiscal primarily based on this trend  the revenue projections for the next several years were revised downward 
as a result of these revised projections  the present value of the future estimated cash flows from the reporting unit were significantly less than those estimated in prior periods 
the fair value of the viranative reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the present value of estimated future cash flows  quoted market prices and market multiples from comparable businesses 
after evaluating the results of these valuation methods a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million was recognized in april on the viranative reporting unit 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets represents the amortization of our acquired developed technology 
this developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately years 
for the year ended june   amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended june  this increase in amortization expense of approximately  is due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended june  totaling approximately million primarily represents interest expense on our june convertible notes consisting of principal interest totaling million in cash and approximately million in shares of our common stock valued at per share and non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discounts on these notes and related closing costs totaling approximately million 
interest expense for the year ended june  totaling approximately million primarily represents interest expense on our april and june convertible debentures of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount represent non cash interest expense  which is comprised of the amortization of the discounts on the debentures  which arose from detachable warrants and shares of common stock issued with the debentures  as well as the debentures beneficial conversion feature 

table of contents included in interest expense for the year ended june   was an adjustment to record non cash interest expense totaling approximately million as a result of the revaluation of the warrants issued in connection with the april and june convertible debentures 
at the time of issuance the warrants were valued using their expected lives  which was less than their contractual lives 
ernst young llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  concurred with this approach 
in january  we were informed by ernst young llp that they had reevaluated their interpretation of the accounting literature as it relates to the accounting for common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with financing transactions 
as a result of this subsequent interpretation  we and ernst young llp determined that valuing the warrants issued in connection with our april and june securities purchase agreements using their expected lives was not correct 
by using the expected lives of the warrants  less value was attributed to them than if we had used the contractual lives 
thus  an additional discount of approximately million would have been recorded on the convertible debentures issued under the april and june securities purchase agreements by using the contractual lives on the warrants 
this additional discount associated with the convertible debentures resulted in an understatement of our non cash interest expense of approximately million in the quarter ended june  and million in the quarter ended september  after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances  we recognized the full amount of the prior period non cash interest expense in the quarter ended december   as management believes it is not material to any period affected 
also  we recorded additional non cash interest expense of approximately million in the quarter ended december  relating to this matter 
also included in interest expense is interest incurred on the debt facilities maintained by our swedish subsidiary 
these debt facilities have interest rates of approximately 
interest expense on these debt facilities for the year ended june  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
other income  net the primary components of other income  net are interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  grant income from government agencies in scotland  sublease income on certain office space in our facility in scotland  transaction gains or losses on foreign exchange  remeasurement gains or losses on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  gains or losses on the disposal of property  plant and equipment  and income generated from research and development support services provided by our swedish subsidiary 
other income  net for the year ended june   totaled approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase of approximately million is primarily attributed to an increase in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaling approximately million and remeasurement gains on foreign exchange totaling approximately million 
these foreign exchange gains arose from the remeasurement of british pound denominated bank accounts and short term investments to us dollars as well as the remeasurement of a u 
s dollar denominated intercompany liability 
during the quarter ended december  we recorded approximately million gain on the remeasurement of a liability to viragen by viragen scotland  which was denominated in us dollars 
in prior periods  this liability had been translated at historical exchange rates since this liability was determined to be long term in nature 
this determination was based on the fact that viragen scotland did not have the ability or intent to repay the liability to viragen 
in recent periods  viragen scotland has been gradually settling the liability by charging viragen for services performed on our behalf 
management anticipates the liability will be settled through these charges in the near term 
therefore  it was determined that the account should no longer be considered long term and thus translation at current exchange rates is appropriate 
since the liability was denominated in us dollars and the pound sterling has been strengthening against the us dollar over the last few years  the remeasurement of the liability resulted in a gain 
had the determination been made when viragen scotland began settling the liability with charges to viragen in prior periods and the liability been remeasured at then current exchange rates  the impact on the statements of operations would not have been material and there would have been no effect on stockholders equity as such currency gains are reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income 

table of contents income tax benefit we are subject to tax in the united states  sweden  and the united kingdom 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
for the year ended june  and  income tax benefit totaled approximately  and  respectively 
income tax benefits for these periods arose from of the amortization expense on certain intangible assets 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our balance sheet reflects a deferred income tax liability of approximately  as of june   all of which is related to our developed technology intangible asset acquired on september  based on our accumulated losses  a full valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of june   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes 
the expiration dates on these net operating loss carry forwards range from through at june   viragen scotland and viranative had net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating losses at viragen scotland and viranative do not expire 
compared to product sales product sales for decreased significantly compared to the previous year 
for the fiscal year ended june  product sales totaled approximately  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease is primarily due to the absence of sales of bulk interferon product to alfa wasserman under a contractual arrangement which expired in december for the fiscal year ended june   sales to alfa wasserman totaled approximately  cost of sales cost of sales and excess idle production costs totaled approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cost of sales of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   and the resulting negative margins are attributed to excess idle capacity costs 
excess idle capacity costs represent fixed production costs incurred at our swedish manufacturing facility  which were not absorbed as a result of the suspension of routine manufacturing as of march  this planned break in routine manufacturing was necessary to allow for certain steps of our production process to be segregated and transferred to our owned facility located in ersboda  sweden  which is currently being renovated 
we will continue to incur excess idle production costs until we resume production at normal operating levels that absorb our fixed production costs 
research and development costs research and development costs include scientific salaries and support fees  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  contracted research and development  equipment rentals  repairs and maintenance  utilities and research related travel 
for the fiscal year ended june   research and development costs totaled approximately million compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of approximately million is mainly attributed to costs incurred in the development of potential commercial applications of our natural human alpha interferon product at our scottish facility totaling approximately million 
also contributing to the increase in research and development were increases related to our avian transgenics project and other research and development costs totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in research and development costs incurred in our oncology projects totaling approximately million 
our reduction in oncology related research expenditures reflect our decision to focus limited research funding availability to projects believed to have a greater likelihood of commercial success within a shorter period of time 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel salaries and related expenses  office and equipment leases  utilities  repairs and maintenance  insurance  legal  accounting  consulting  depreciation and amortization expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of approximately million is mainly attributed to increases in personnel related termination costs  consulting fees  and patent related legal fees at our swedish subsidiary totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june   we also experienced an increase in general corporate legal fees and patent filing fees related to our avian transgenics project totaling approximately million 
also contributing to the increase were increases in insurance expense and travel related expenses at our florida headquarters totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in personnel related expenses at our florida headquarters totaling approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the purchase price allocated to separately identified intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of viranative in september the separately identified intangible assets consist of developed technology and a customer contract 
the developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately years 
the customer contract was amortized over the term of the contract  which expired in december for the fiscal year ended june   amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately  compared to approximately  during the fiscal year ended june  the decrease of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  is primarily the result of the acquired customer contract being fully amortized as of december interest and other income the primary components of interest and other income are interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  grant income from government agencies in scotland  sub lease income on certain office space in our facility in scotland  transaction gains or losses on foreign exchange  gains or losses on the disposal of property  plant and equipment  and income generated from research and development support services provided by our swedish subsidiary 
interest and other income for the fiscal year ended june   totaled approximately  compared to approximately  for the previous fiscal year 
this increase of approximately  is primarily attributed to an increase in income generated from research and development support services provided by our swedish subsidiary and interest earned on cash and cash equivalent totaling approximately  and  respectively 
also contributing to this increase in interest and other income is an increase in sub lease income at our scottish facility totaling approximately  these increases in interest and other income were offset in part by an increase in the loss of the disposition of property  plant and equipment totaling approximately  interest expense interest expense in fiscal totaled approximately million and primarily consists of interest expense on our convertible notes and debentures of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount represents non cash interest expense for the fiscal year ended june  interest expense for the fiscal year ended june  totaling approximately million included approximately million in non cash interest expense on previously outstanding convertible notes and debentures 
this non cash interest expense is comprised of the amortization of the discounts on the debentures  which arose from the valuation of detachable warrants and shares of common stock issued with the debentures  as well as the debentures beneficial conversion feature 

table of contents included in interest expense for the fiscal year ended june   is an adjustment to record non cash interest expense totaling approximately million as a result of the revaluation of warrants issued in connection with our april and june convertible debentures 
at the time of issuance the warrants were valued using their expected lives  which was less than their contractual lives 
ernst young llp  our independent registered accounting firm  concurred with this approach 
in january  we were informed by ernst young llp that they had revaluated their interpretation of the accounting literature as it relates to the accounting for common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with financing transactions 
as a result of this subsequent interpretation  we and ernst young llp determined that valuing the warrants issued in connection with our april and june securities purchase agreements using their expected lives was not correct 
by using the expected lives of the warrants  less value was attributed to them than if we had used the contractual lives 
thus  by using the contractual lives on the warrants  an additional discount of approximately million would have been recorded on the convertible debentures issued under the april and june securities purchase agreements 
this additional discount associated with the convertible debentures resulted in an understatement of our non cash interest expense of approximately million in the fiscal year ended june  after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances  we recognized the full amount of the prior period non cash interest expense in the quarter ended december   as management believes it is not material to any period affected 
also included in interest expense for the fiscal years ended june  and june  is interest incurred on the debt facilities maintained by our swedish subsidiary totaling approximately  and  respectively 
these credit facilities have interest rates ranging from to 
income tax benefit we are subject to tax in the united states  sweden  and the united kingdom 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
for the year ended june   income tax benefit totaled approximately  a decrease of approximately  when compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year as a result of the fully amortized customer contract intangible asset 
income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  consists of the amortization expense on certain intangible assets 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our balance sheet reflects a deferred tax income liability of approximately  as of june   all of which is related to our developed technology intangible asset acquired on september  based on our accumulated losses  a full valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of june   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes 

table of contents research and development programs our research and development programs include the avian transgenics platform  two humanized antibodies and ongoing studies in support of multiferon and next generation interferon alpha products 
research and development costs totaled approximately million  million and million  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
avian transgenics our avian transgenic manufacturing program is designed to enable us to produce protein based drugs  including monoclonal antibodies  in the whites of eggs laid by transgenic chickens 
our goal is to develop a technology which will enable us to offer a viable and cost effective alternative for the large scale production requirements of the biopharmaceutical industry and also for our own therapeutic protein products 
existing protein production technologies are often inefficient and costly 
we believe that this technology will allow us to offer the biopharmaceutical industry an efficient method of production of their protein based products 
it is envisaged that this technology will have a higher capacity  lower manufacturing costs and may be able to offer improvements to the products themselves 
we believe our avian transgenics project could offer a rapid and cost effective way to produce large volumes of therapeutic proteins 
in addition to meeting the current and future alternative production demands of the biopharmaceutical industry and generating significant revenue for us  this project could also accelerate the progress of several life saving drugs to the market at an affordable cost 
at the current time  we are developing four product candidates using the avian transgenic technology 
the first  a humanized version of the anti gd antibody that is the subject of a collaborative research agreement between viragen and sloan kettering institute  has already realized key milestones  including our june announcement of detection and recovery of the intact and bioactive antibody  from the white of transgenic hen eggs 
of the remaining three product candidates in development  two are currently approved commercial products 
we have not yet announced the identity of these three product candidates  but expect with continuing successes  to do so in the coming months 
we expect to report successes in developing this technology and possibly initiating production of some or all of our product candidates in the calendar year 
for the fiscal years ended  and  we incurred costs related to the avian transgenics project totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately million in related research and development costs 

table of contents antibodies there have been a great number of developments in the treatment of cancer in humans over the years 
monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be able to offer significant advantages over other therapies  yet even with this success  current products still fall far short of the ideal with respect to both efficacy and to a lesser extent  safety 
trends in treatment options are tending to favor multiple agents and therapies in combination or sequential administration as well as targeted therapeutics 
still  there remains much room for improvement 
we have selected two monoclonal antibodies for our research and development projects based largely upon novelty  prior pre clinical information  and prior testing in humans 
both of our current antibody projects are unique in these respects and both offer the potential to be developed into a platform based technology 
vg in april  we executed a global exclusive license with cancer research technology uk for the rights to develop and commercialize an anti cd antibody 
this specific antibody was developed through the research of professor lindy durrant of the university of nottingham  uk 
the cd antigen is significantly over expressed on nearly all solid tumors in humans 
early studies at nottingham demonstrated that the antibody was able to bind only to tumor antigen and furthermore  it was shown to bind in a highly novel manner  different from all anti cd antibodies known in the scientific literature 
this novelty underpins the intellectual property surrounding vg  in addition to other intellectual property we have created through our development activities 
the cd antigen has been shown to block the body s natural immune system from attacking and killing cancer cells 
theoretically  if an antibody can be developed that binds selectively to tumor cd antigen  this protective mechanism will be removed and the natural immune system  or concomitantly or sequentially administered anti tumor agents  would then be able to destroy cancer cells 
importantly  professor durrant has produced the mouse form of this antibody and has administered it successfully to humans in a scintigraphy procedure imaging 
these studies demonstrated the specificity of binding only to tumor antigen  and not normal cells  and demonstrated tolerability in humans  albeit small numbers and dosages  without safety incident 
it is this data  and our own exploratory data in our laboratories  that has led us to license what we believe may become an important addition to the arsenal for fighting a number of types of cancer 
at the current time we are developing production processes for a humanized version of this antibody to continue pre clinical studies  and we hope to be ready to initiate toxicology studies on the humanized form during calendar  followed by meetings with regulatory authorities to agree upon clinical development protocols 
we have not yet selected a target indication for this antibody  however  we have identified ovarian cancer  breast cancer and head and neck cancer as among the possibilities 
at this time  we are not able to predict any date for the start of clinical trials 
for the fiscal years ended  and  we incurred costs related to the vg project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately million in research and development costs 
vg in  we entered into a collaborative research and development agreement with sloan kettering institute ski for the joint development of an antibody to the gd antigen  which is over expressed on several types of cancer cells  most notably melanoma 
this agreement was extended in february and goes through february it is believed that the gd antigen protects melanoma cells from the body s natural immune system  and anti cancer therapeutics  thereby allowing cells to proliferate and grow 
by removing this protection  using an antibody that selectively binds to the gd antigen  the natural immune system has a better chance to kill these tumor cells  as would separately administered anti cancer agents 

table of contents ski clinicians have previously studied the mouse form of this antibody in a fairly extensive manner in numerous human clinical trials 
however  use of mouse derived antibodies typically influences the outcome of testing in humans in that the human body reacts to mouse antibody as if it was a foreign invader  thereby reducing the overall efficacy  and tolerability  of the product 
ski was able to demonstrate that this antibody had beneficial effects in patients with stage iv melanoma  the most deadly stage of this disease 
ski also found that the antibody had therapeutic utility when used alone  but greater therapeutic utility when used with other compounds 
if the antibody can be produced in a humanized form  thereby eliminating at least some of the undesirable effects  whether used alone or in combination with other products  it could offer significant improvement in this disease setting 
importantly  to date  there are no other products available to successfully treat stage iv melanoma 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with ski  for an exclusive license to this antibody  as provided for in the earlier agreement 
at the current time  we are developing production processes for various forms of the antibody  including the avian transgenics technology  in an effort to generate humanized forms 
these antibodies be shared with ski clinicians for comparability testing  done in parallel with studies at our viragen scotland laboratories  following which we will select one humanized form to complete pre clinical studies in preparation for meetings with the us food and drug administration 
we expect a meeting with the fda could be requested in calendar  provided a license agreement is executed 
we are not able to predict a date for the start of clinical trials 
during the fiscal years and  we have incurred minimal costs associated with our r project 
for the fiscal year  we incurred costs in connection with this project totaling approximately  since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately million in research and development costs 
iep we entered into an agreement with the university of miami and the um sylvester comprehensive cancer center to develop an anti cancer technology with an option to license the technology upon completion of certain milestones 
in may  we decided to allow this option to expire 
this project has thus been terminated and we will no longer have any expenses related to it 
we have returned all documentation and the rights to this technology to the university 
for the fiscal years ended  and we incurred costs related to the iep project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
multiferon our natural  leukocyte derived multi subtype interferon alpha product  multiferon r has been developed as an alternative to synthetic recombinant  single subtype products  and is currently approved in many countries for any indication where patients fail  relapse from  or fail to tolerate  synthetic interferon alpha products 
multiferon is currently approved in countries around the world and actively marketed in of those countries through local distribution partners  and our own sales team in sweden 
interferon alpha is the human body s first line of defense against infectious disease 
human leukocytes  in the blood  secrete a number of different types of interferon alphas when exposed to attack by viruses and bacteria 
viragen collects human leukocytes  a by product of blood collection  and under highly exacting procedures  subjects these to a viral challenge that is known to be benign to humans  but stimulates the leukocytes to produce a unique mixture of interferon alpha subtypes 
we then collect and purify the resultant interferon alphas using our proprietary technologies to result in multiferon 
the mixture of subtypes contained in multiferon is unique among all interferon alpha products 

table of contents multiferon has been and continues to be studied in clinical trials in humans as rescue therapy for patients who have been treated with synthetic interferon alpha products but who have for various reasons not responded to that treatment 
at the current time  we have clinical trials under way in mexico and greece in hepatitis c and we are currently contemplating a study in sweden in order to investigate a different treatment regimen also in hepatitis c 
multiferon is also indicated for use in some types of leukemia and cancers 
we have recently completed a long term follow up of a clinical trial conducted in patients with high risk malignant melanoma  and subsequently we have filed with the swedish medical products agency for approval for first line adjuvant therapy in february  we expect a decision on this by the end of calendar we are now contemplating another larger clinical trial in malignant melanoma to study further the effects of the product on various stages of the disease in what will potentially become a pan european study 
we will not start this clinical trial until some time in  provided we obtain regulatory approvals to do so  and provided we have the financial ability to fund this study 
multiferon is believed to have other potential uses in other cancer treatment regimens and we are currently evaluating a number of other possible indications for which clinical trials would be required in order to gain approvals 
while developing data in support of multiferon  we have been gathering information on the mechanisms of action involved in the interferon alpha response against viral diseases and cancers 
from this information  we envisage that potential next generation interferon products may evolve 
it is not possible at this time to predict whether any of these developments or potential new products will be successful or what costs will be incurred to further determine the therapeutic value of such products 
the timelines and costs for the completion of biopharmaceutical research and product development programs are difficult to accurately predict for various reasons  including the inherent exploratory nature of the work 
the achievement of project milestones is dependent on issues which may impact development timelines and can be unpredictable and beyond viragen s control 
these issues include  availability of capital funding  presence of competing technologies  unexpected experimental results which may cause the direction of research to change  accumulated knowledge about the intrinsic properties of the candidate product  the availability of good manufacturing practices grade material  results from preclinical and clinical studies  potential changes in prescribing practice and patient profiles and regulatory requirements 
the completion of all of the above research and development projects is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional funding or our ability to identify potential collaborative partners that would share in project costs 
our future capital requirements are dependent upon many factors  including revenue generated from the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product  progress with future clinical trials  the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in patent applications  competing technologies and market developments  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and effective commercialization activities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise transacted in derivatives nor do we expect to do so in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk the fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk 
while changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt  we believe a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  future results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct operations in several different countries 
the balance sheet accounts of our operations in scotland and sweden are translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the respective local currency may strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  which would impact the value of stockholders investment in our common stock 
fluctuations in the value of the british pound and swedish krona against the us dollar have occurred during our history  which have resulted in unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and shown in the equity section of our balance sheet 
while most of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency  some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of this type of transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
our results of operations may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the british pound and swedish krona  in relation to the us dollar 
most of the revenue and expense items of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the respective local currency 
an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower revenue when translated into us dollars 
operating expenses would also be lower in these circumstances 
during the fiscal year ended june   the us dollar has experienced adverse fluctuations against the british pound and the swedish krona 
at one point during the fiscal year  the us dollar had lost approximately and of its value against the british pound and swedish krona  respectively  compared to june  as a result of the weak us dollar during fiscal  we experienced greater revenues  but  more significantly  greater operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when translated to us dollars 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure 
however  we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we have not incurred significant realized losses on exchange transactions 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses 
we were not adversely impacted by the european union s adoption of the euro currency 
our foreign operations to date have been located in scotland and sweden  which have not participated in the adoption of the euro as of june
