item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for detailed information regarding the revenues contributed by market segment 
manufacturing process the manufacturing facilities are organized by work centers focusing on a particular manufacturing process 
depending on the component  the company utilizes either a forming process or a machining process 
each work center is staffed by a team of operators who are supported by a supervisor  lead operators and quality inspectors 
throughout each stage of the manufacturing and finishing processes  the company collects  maintains and evaluates data  including customer design inputs  process scheduling  material inventory  labor  inspection results and completion and delivery dates 
the company s information systems employ this data to provide accurate pricing and scheduling information to its customers as well as to establish production standards used to measure internal performance 
in manufacturing some components for the sheet metal segment  the company uses several forming processes to shape or form a work piece aluminum  stainless steel or titanium sheet metal and extrusion into components by applying pressure through impact  stretching or pressing the raw material sheet metal or extrusion to cause conformance to a die 
the shapes may be simple with a single angle  bend or curve or may be complex with compound contours having multiple bends and angles 
some processes incorporate heat to soften the metal prior to or during forming 
forming processes include drop hammer  fluid cell press  sheet metal and extrusion stretch  skin stretch  stretch draw  hot joggle  brake forming  roll forming and radial draw 
additionally  certain products manufactured by the sheet metal segments and virtually all of the machining and technology segment products are produced using close tolerance machining methods 
various metals are machined  such as stainless  aluminum  monel  kevlar  and numerous varieties of steel and castings for small to medium sized parts  in heat treated and non heat treated conditions 
parts are processed through conventional and computer numerical control machining methods  also known as cnc  from raw material or castings up to and through assembly processes 
in addition  complex machining of parts is accomplished through experience in engineering set ups to produce intricate and close tolerances with very restricted finish requirements 
each machining facility is also set up to complete turnkey  research and development projects to better support engineering changes from customers 
value added services in addition to the products the company sells  each segment offers its customers various value added services that are intended to result in both cost and time savings 
these services may include the production of tooling  heat treating and aging of components  computer inspection and engineering of components  chemical milling  metal finishing  polishing and painting  assembly  prototyping and warehousing  distribution and kitting 
distribution facilities in savannah  georgia and tulsa  oklahoma are designed to kit manufactured components and deliver to point of use at customer sites 
backlog the company s backlog for each of its business segments is displayed in the following table as of december  in millions sheet metal segment total portion deliverable within months machining and technology segment total portion deliverable within months the company s customers often modify purchase orders to accelerate or delay delivery dates 
the level of unfilled orders at any given time during the year will be materially affected by provisioning policies of the company s customers  the timing of the company s receipt of orders and the speed with which those orders are filled 
moreover  sales during any period may include sales which are not part of the backlog at the end of the prior period 
raw materials and procurement practices most of the company s aerospace components are manufactured from aerospace quality aluminum sheet metal and extrusion 
from time to time the company  and the aerospace components industry as a whole  has experienced shortages in the availability of aerospace quality aluminum sheet metal and extrusion 
such shortages could inhibit the company s ability to deliver products to its customers on a timely basis 
a strategy adopted by the commercial division of boeing requires that boeing subcontractors purchase aluminum sheet  aluminum extrusion and titanium sheet from tmx aerospace a boeing designated raw material service provider 
this supply chain approach is intended to control raw material pricing and assure adequate levels of inventory for both boeing and its supply base 
additional designated material source strategies are used by several of the company s customers 
like the boeing arrangement  these customer supply arrangements are intended to provide the company with access to an assured supply of materials at competitive pricing 
the company obtains its raw materials for the technology portion of its machining and technology segment from a variety of vendors and distributors 
the company believes its relationships with its suppliers are satisfactory 
while the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products  alternative suppliers exist for substantially all of the products and services purchased by the company 
quality assurance and control the company continually seeks to maintain high quality standards in the fabrication and processing of its products 
accordingly  the company employs full time quality control and assurance personnel 
each work order introduced to the company s manufacturing facilities contains an inspection plan specifying required inspection points 
quality inspectors are assigned to each work center and are trained in the testing required in connection with products passing through the assigned work center 
although a large percentage of the company s products are inspected immediately prior to shipment by a customer employee or a customer designated company employee  boeing has approved a sampling inspection program for certain components using statistical process control data maintained by the company 
the company s quality systems are continuously reviewed and updated to comply with the requirements of iso  as revision b and nadcap quality standards 
through this continuous improvement process the company has maintained its approval by boeing to d as well as other customers quality standards 
this updating process has allowed certain facilities with third party registrations for iso  as rev 
b and nadcap to maintain those certifications for during the company intends to continue to review all procedures to ensure that they meet the latest revisions to the iso and as standards 
the company will continue with its ongoing employee training program and use of lean manufacturing techniques to assist employees in becoming familiar with any changes in the company s procedures 
the company has continued to develop a robust internal auditing program for each of the facilities to ensure that the training is effective and to ensure ongoing compliance to customer required standards 
sales and marketing the company has realigned its sales and marketing organization into four market sectors commercial aerospace  military aircraft  business regional jets and non aerospace which includes sales to the technology and commercial sheet metal industries 
within these sectors  one sales and marketing director  two market sector directors and five program managers support the company and its customers in the conduct of business 
at each of the company s facilities  customer service representatives establish and maintain a business relationship between customers and the company s production and fabrication business units with a focus on customer satisfaction 
additionally  two independent sales representatives conduct business on behalf of the company 
a majority of the company s sales to existing customers are awarded after receipt of a request for quotation rfq 
on receipt  the rfq is preliminarily reviewed by a team consisting of members of the company s senior management  a program manager  an estimator and the plant manager 
if the company determines the program is adequately compatible with the company s capabilities and objectives  a formal response is prepared by a member of the company s estimator group 
a substantial percentage of programs are awarded on a competitive bid basis 
competition components for customers in the aerospace industry are provided by a large fragmented group of companies  including certain business units or affiliates of the company s customers 
the company believes participants in the aerospace industry compete primarily with respect to delivery  price and quality 
to the contrary  the company believes that there are only a few producers of components similar to the principal technology components manufactured by the company s machining and technology segment 
the company believes that engineering capability  responsiveness and price are key aspects of competition in the technology industry 
in all industries in which the company competes  certain of the company s competitors  including business units affiliated with the company s customers  have substantially greater financial  production and other resources than the company 
the company has also recognized a trend by certain of its customers to outsource production to foreign countries where labor costs are significantly lower 
in addition  the company s customers have expanded the use of industry participation arrangements  pursuant to which oems and primes agree to outsource certain manufacturing contract work to a foreign country in return for orders for new aircraft 
governmental regulations  environmental compliance the company s operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and substantial regulation by government agencies  including the united states environmental protection agency epa  the united states occupational safety and health administration osha and the federal aviation administration faa 
among other matters  these agencies impose requirements that regulate the handling  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials generated or used by the company during the normal course of its operations  govern the health and safety of the company s employees and require the company to meet certain standards and licensing requirements for aerospace components 
this extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on the company and  as a result  may substantially affect its operational costs 
in addition  the company may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its facilities without regard to whether or not the company knew of  or caused  the release of such substances 
the company believes it currently is in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any material environmental violations at any of its current or former facilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that its prior activities did not create a material environmental situation for which the company could be responsible or that future uses or conditions including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations  or an increase in the amount of hazardous substances generated or used by the company s operations will not result in any material environmental liability to the company or result in a material adverse effect to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
employees as of december   the company had permanent employees  of whom were engaged in executive positions  were engaged in administrative positions and were engaged in manufacturing operations 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has not experienced any material business interruption as a result of labor disputes since it was formed 
the company believes it has an excellent relationship with its employees 
the company strives to continuously train and educate its employees  thereby enhancing the skill and flexibility of its work force 
through the use of internally developed programs  which include formal classroom and on the job  hands on training  independently developed programs  and certain company funded tuition reimbursement programs  the company seeks to attract  develop and retain the personnel necessary to achieve the company s growth and profitability objectives 
in order to increase its customer focus  the company initiated several changes in its organizational structure 
the company divided its manufacturing plants into a west coast region and a central region and named regional vice presidents to oversee these operations 
within the manufacturing plants  customer focused operating units were developed which expanded our expertise in customer quality requirements and manufacturing methods 
the company also began transitioning to a matrix organizational structure with several dual reporting relationships between corporate and plant positions in order to enhance company wide communications  provide consistency in approach  and strengthen our operation as one company 
seasonality the company does not generally experience any seasonality in the demand for its products 
geographic operations the company derives less than ten percent of its sales from foreign sources

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company manufactures and distributes formed and machined components for use in the aerospace  technology and commercial sheet metal industries 
the company primarily sells its products to the commercial aircraft  military  corporate and regional aircraft  and technology markets within the aerospace and technology industries 
historically  the company s business was primarily dependent on the commercial aircraft market  with boeing as the company s principal customer 
in order to diversify its product and customer base  the company implemented an acquisition and marketing strategy in the late s that has broadened the number of industries to which the company sells its components  and  within the aerospace industry  has diversified its customer base to reduce the company s dependence on boeing 
the following table illustrates the company s sales percentages over the last three years to its primary industries and markets 
market commercial aircraft corporate and regional aircraft military products technology products other total includes commercial sheet metal and various aerospace products 
beginning in  the company began an aggressive acquisition campaign that resulted in the consummation of four transactions through in april  the company acquired tempco engineering inc and certain of its affiliates tempco  which expanded the company s aerospace product line and introduced the company to the technology industry 
in  the company acquired versaform corporation and certain of its affiliates versaform  as well as stretch forming corporation sfc and southern stretch forming and fabrication  inc ssff 
the versaform acquisition significantly increased the company s presence in the corporate and regional aircraft market  while adding some military products to the company s product line 
the sfc acquisition further supplemented the company s military product line 
finally  the company s acquisition of ssff increased the company s business in the corporate and regional market 
as a result of the development of tempco s business  the company determined that tempco should operate and be managed as an autonomous unit  and  accordingly  as a business segment separate from the company s other businesses 
the tempco business  which sells machined components to both the aerospace and technology industries  is referred to in this discussion as the machining and technology segment and the company s other businesses are referred to as the sheet metal segment 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table provides the comparative data in millions of dollars for and for each of the company s segments 
sheet metal machining technology total sheet metal machining technology total net sales cost of sales gross profit s  g a income loss from operations the sheet metal segment net sales 
net sales for the sheet metal segment were million in  an increase of from million in the following table summarizes the sales in millions of dollars of the sheet metal segment by the market served market difference commercial aircraft corporate regional aircraft military other total net sales of components used on commercial aircraft were million in  unchanged from increases on net sales of components for the boeing model in were offset by declines in net sales on the boeing  and models 
net sales of components on corporate and regional aircraft were million in  up by from million in this increase in net sales was driven by higher production rates on gulfstream aircraft in addition to new work awarded to the segment by gulfstream and bombardier 
net sales of military products were million in  down from million in this decline was attributable to the end of a b refurbishment program in and a decline in demand for components used on f aircraft 
gross profit 
the sheet metal segment generated gross profit of million of net sales in  an increase from million of net sales in the segment initiated a restructuring effort in its st 
charles  missouri facility in the third quarter of and a separate restructuring at its wichita  kansas facility in the first quarter of these restructuring efforts realigned production processes within these facilities and transferred certain processes to other facilities in the segment to reduce fixed overhead and employment levels at these locations 
the combination of these restructuring efforts and the increase in net sales discussed above provided the improvement in gross profit in specifically  the segment generated a million increase in net sales and incurred labor and fringe benefit costs of million in compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the sheet metal segment were million in  up from million in included in these expenses were restructuring costs of million in and million in excluding these restructuring expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in this decrease was due to a reduction in payroll expenses 
exit costs 
during the second half of  the segment began a restructuring of its st 
charles  missouri facility by realigning its production processes  reducing employment levels and exiting a leased facility 
additionally  early in  the segment restructured its wichita  kansas facility by transferring all forming processes other than hydraulic fluid forming and related milling operations to other facilities within the segment  reducing employment levels and preparing to exit an owned facility that the company plans to sell in the segment incurred million in and million in of costs related to severance pay  moving costs and training of operators at the facilities receiving new work from the restructured facilities 
the segment expects to incur only modest costs related to these restructurings in the machining and technology segment net sales 
net sales for the machining and technology segment were million in  a increase from million in a summary of net sales in millions of dollars by market is displayed in the following table market difference laser equipment military other total net sales to the laser equipment markets were million in  up from million in this increase was generated by strong demand in the second quarter of for components used in lasers for the semiconductor industry 
demand for laser components was impacted by a program instituted by one of the company s customers to refurbish used components instead of purchasing new components 
net sales of military products were million in compared to million in  an increase of 
net sales of components used on the apache helicopter were million in  up from million in this increase in net sales on the apache program was attributable to increased production rates for the helicopter and a maintenance order from the us government for which deliveries began in the fourth quarter of and is expected to end in the first quarter of gross profit 
the machining and technology segment generated a gross profit of million of net sales in  an increase from million of net sales in the increased net sales allowed the segment to generate labor efficiencies in production as manufacturing labor and related fringe benefits incurred were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in the segment successfully re priced a key component to a customer that added million to gross profit 
the increased net sales also provided better coverage of fixed costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the segment incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of million of net sales in  up from million of net sales in this increase was attributable to increased payroll expenses from additional staff and bonus payments 
non operating expenses other income 
the company generated other income of million in and the other income included a gain of million on the sale of the company s versaform canada subsidiary 
this gain was offset by losses on disposals of idle capital equipment of million 
during  the company generated gains of million on the sale of certain available for sale securities 
interest 
interest expense was million in and million in this million increase was attributable to million in fees charged by the company s former primary lender and increased interest rates payable under the lending agreement governing the company s debt through november  see note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
income taxes 
the company incurred income tax expense of million in compared to a benefit of million in the large benefit in was attributable to the large financial loss in that period 
the effective tax rate was in and in year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table in millions of dollars provides the comparative data for and for each of the company s segments 
sheet metal machining technology total sheet metal machining technology total net sales cost of sales gross profit s  g a goodwill impairment income loss from operations the sheet metal segment net sales 
net sales for the sheet metal segment were million in  up from million in net sales were augmented in by the inclusion of a full year of revenue from the acquisitions of versaform in may  sfc in june and ssff in september which were partly offset by lower commercial  corporate and regional aircraft sales 
the following table summarizes the sales of the sheet metal segment by the market served market difference commercial aircraft corporate regional aircraft military other total net sales for use on boeing commercial aircraft were million in the decline in net sales of components for boeing commercial aircraft of million is principally due to reduced volume on the and models which generated less than of the segment s net sales 
net sales for the were million in and million in the segment generated net sales for the model of million in  up from million in boeing ended production of the model in  which only contributed million of net sales to the segment in  down from million in the model  currently produced at historically low rates  is threatened with cancellation if the united states air force does not purchase a tanker version of the the segment generated net sales for the of million in  down from million in net sales for the corporate and regional aircraft markets were million in  down million from this reduction resulted from a decline in volume for gulfstream products  which accounted for million in net sales in compared to million in in the third quarter of  gulfstream ceased production of aircraft for days and cut production schedules  thereby reducing its demand for the segment s product 
in september  the segment opened a distribution facility in savannah  georgia  near gulfstream s production facility and began supplying kits comprised of product both produced by the segment and purchased from other suppliers 
the new facility generated only million in net sales during as deliveries began in november 
net sales in were negatively impacted by million due to the start up of the distribution facility as product previously sold to the customer was provided to the distribution facility 
offsetting this decline was an increase in net sales for the bombardier family of aircraft to million in from million in the increase in bombardier demand was primarily driven by the canadair regional jet 
net sales of military product were million in  up million from this increase was primarily attributable to shipments of product for a b refurbishment program of million in  up from million in  net sales on lockheed martin aircraft  principally f and c  of million  up from million in  and a new program with gkn aerospace which generated net sales of million in gross profit 
the sheet metal segment had a gross profit of million of sales in  compared to million of net sales in the decline in gross profit was due to a million increase in the company s inventory obsolescence and slow moving reserve in the fourth quarter based on management s evaluation of the current aerospace industry  customer requirements and inventory quantities 
this reserve offset a favorable gross profit impact 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  up from million in the million increase primarily reflects the inclusion of the versaform acquisition for a full year 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses were restructuring costs of million in these costs were incurred as the segment executed a downsizing of the st 
charles plant 
the costs incurred included severance pay  costs of moving and rearrangement and professional fees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
goodwill impairment 
in  the segment recorded an impairment charge of million to reflect the write off of goodwill as determined under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k and critical accounting estimates set forth later in this discussion for more information on the testing process and assumptions made by the company 
the impairment charge in removed all goodwill from the segment 
interest expense 
interest expense for the segment was million in  up from million in interest expense for the segment was predominantly due to borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisition of versaform in may the note evidencing this indebtedness was issued with a three year maturity and was amortized on a seven year schedule 
the note accrued interest at libor plus and the effective rate was at december  the increase in interest expense was due to twelve months of interest in compared to eight months of interest in please see liquidity and capital resources  below 
the machining and technology segment net sales 
net sales for the machining and technology segment were million in  down from million in declines in components for lasers and military programs contributed to the reduction in net sales 
net sales of products used in laser equipment were million in  down from million in the segment s largest customer supplies the semiconductor industry and experienced a decline in demand which resulted in lower demand for the company s products 
this decline was moderated by a slight increase in sales of products for medical lasers used in lasik eye surgery 
net sales of military components were million in  down from million in these components are primarily used on boeing s apache helicopter and in guidance systems for various military applications 
the sale in of boeing s weapon and armament division to alliant tech systems atk disrupted normal sales volumes in as sales to the combined entities were million in  down from million in this decline was due to a surge of orders in during the afghanistan invasion  inventory adjustments at boeing and atk  and the competitive loss of certain components after the sale 
gross profit 
the machining and technology segment generated a gross profit of million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in the rapid decline in net sales early in was managed by manufacturing certain work previously performed at suppliers  resulting in a decrease in purchased subcontract services to million of net sales in from million of net sales in additionally  manufacturing salaries  wages and fringes reduced in total dollars but increased as a percentage of net sales to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decline in labor and fringe dollars was indicative of management s attempt to reduce hours and employment levels during periods of lower sales 
however  these reductions did not match the rate of decline in net sales  resulting in lower productivity and gross margins 
the lower revenue base also provided less benefit to cover the fixed costs related to the operations 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an additional million reserve for components determined to be obsolete or slow moving 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the segment s selling  general and administrative expenses were comprised principally of administrative salaries and wages  professional services and fees for corporate services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million of net sales  up slightly from million of net sales in this increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll related to accounting support 
interest expense 
interest expense for the machining and technology segment was related to the term note executed to fund the purchase of tempco 
the interest rate was ninety day libor plus  subject to a floor of and a ceiling of 
the note was reduced using a seven year amortization schedule and was issued with a maturity date of three and one half years september  
interest on this note was million in  down from million in due entirely to principal reductions as the interest rate had been at the floor rate of for the two year period 
please see liquidity and capital resources  below 
consolidated operations non operating expense other expense 
the company generated non operating income of million from the sale of certain available for sale securities in compared to a loss of million in interest expense 
interest expense from the revolving line of credit is not assigned to a segment as cash for the company is assigned to one account and was million in  up from million in due to higher borrowing in the revolving line of credit

critical accounting estimates certain accounting issues require management estimates and judgments for the preparation of financial statements 
the company believes that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on the company s financial statements 
therefore  the company considers these to be its critical accounting estimates 
the company s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to these estimates 
the company s most significant estimates and judgments are listed below 
accounts receivable reserves 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including historical trends and industry and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit scores  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
the company s evaluation also includes reserves for billing adjustments  pricing changes  warranty claims and disputes 
if circumstances change ie  an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
the company applies this policy to its acquired businesses and makes adjustments to existing bad debt reserves based upon its evaluation 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to a limited number of customers in the aerospace and technology industries 
if these customers experience significant adverse conditions in their industries or operations  including the continued impact of the current downturn in demand for aerospace and technology products  these customers may not be able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to the company for prior sales or purchase additional products under the terms of existing contracts 
inventory 
the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market using actual cost for raw materials and average cost for finished goods and work in process 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company makes judgments as to future demand requirements based upon customer orders in backlog  historical customer orders  customer and industry analyst estimates of aircraft production rates  and other market data available to the company 
additionally  in the aviation industry  these future demand requirements depend on estimates of aircraft lives and the need for spare parts over the course of the aircraft life 
the company has recorded charges in recent periods due to discontinuances of product lines  losses of customer contracts  lack of order activity  or changes in expectations of future requirements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million based upon management s evaluation of the current aerospace industry  customer requirements  and inventory quantities 
the company sells much of its product under fixed price arrangements 
occasionally  costs of production may exceed the market values of certain products and product families  which requires the company to adjust its inventory value 
in these circumstances  management is required to make estimates of costs not yet incurred to determine the ultimate cost of these products that are in work in process 
changes in the assumptions and estimates of such factors as expected scrap  costs of material  labor and outside services and the amount of labor required to complete the products may result in actual results that vary from management s estimates 
at times  the company accepts new orders for products from its customers in which actual production costs may differ from the company s expectations when it quoted the product 
additionally  customers may request engineering changes or quality acceptance changes in products that may alter the cost of products produced by the company 
in these circumstances  the company notifies the customer of these issues and seeks reimbursement for costs incurred over and above the selling price of the products and re pricing of the product on future deliveries 
the company s inventory valuation considers the estimated recovery of these costs 
actual negotiation of the claim amounts may result in outcomes different from those estimated by the company and may have material impacts upon the operating results of the company 
during the fourth quarter of  significant cost over runs were incurred on certain products for which the company submitted a claim to its customer 
at year end  the company could not estimate the probable recovery of any amounts covered by this claim 
therefore  excess inventory costs were written off and margins in were negatively impacted 
subsequent recovery of this claim could have a material impact upon future operating results of the company 
goodwill 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and was adopted by the company effective january  the statement requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment and expensed to the extent the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
the company established the value of its segments with the assistance of an outside expert that used company provided forecasts of operations by reporting unit  independent review of the assumptions in these forecasts  evaluations of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and independent appraisals of the company s fixed assets 
these forecasts required the company to estimate future sales prices and volumes of its reporting units 
the company used its internal budgets  customer order backlog  historical customer ordering patterns  customer and industry projections of demand and other market information as well as current cost of production to estimate future cash flows 
actual results may vary significantly from the company s projections and may result in material adjustments to the goodwill balance on the company s financial statements 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
the company is exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not utilize any particular strategy or instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
the company s outstanding credit facility carries a floating interest rate that now varies based on changes to the prime lending rate of interest of wells fargo 
accordingly  the company is subject to potential fluctuations in its debt service 
based on the amount of the company s outstanding debt as of the end of the fiscal year  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of the company s outstanding credit facility would result in a change in the company s annual interest expense of approximately million during the next fiscal year 
however  under each of the revolver  the equipment loan and the real estate loan  the company has an option to fix the interest rate for a period not to exceed days  which  while not eliminating interest rate risk  allows the company to moderate the impact of changes in wells fargo s prime lending rate
