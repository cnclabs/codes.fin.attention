item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biotechnology company focused on the development and marketing of novel therapeutic and molecular diagnostic products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that permit us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins play in the onset and progression of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new healthcare products that treat major diseases and assess a person s risk of disease later in life 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to undertaking our drug discovery and development programs  operating our predictive medicine business  and continuing our research and development efforts 
we have three reportable operating segments i research  ii predictive medicine  and iii drug development 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding these operating segments 
our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of predictive medicine products and research payments 
we have yet to attain profitability and  for year ended june   we had a net loss of million 
as of june  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to the expansion of our drug discovery and development efforts  the initiation and continuation of human clinical trials  the launch of new predictive medicine products  the performance of our internal research and development programs  and expansion of our facilities 
we incurred research and development expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our pharmaceutical and predictive medicine businesses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and investments in privately held companies 
revenue recognition 
research revenues include revenues from research agreements  milestone payments  and technology licensing agreements 
in applying the principles of sab to research and technology license agreements we consider the terms and conditions of each agreement separately to arrive at a proportional performance methodology of recognizing revenue 
such methodologies involve recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement and based on costs incurred relative to the total estimated contract costs cost to cost method 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in our cost to cost calculations as work progresses and we gain experience 
the principal costs under these agreements are for personnel expenses to conduct research and development but also include costs for materials and other direct and indirect items necessary to complete the research under these agreements 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
payments received on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings and have been recorded as other receivables or deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved and where the amount of the milestone payments approximates the value of achieving the milestone 
we recognize revenue from up front nonrefundable license fees on a straight line basis over the period of our continued involvement in the research and development project 
predictive medicine revenues include revenues from the sale of predictive medicine products  related marketing agreements  and forensic dna analysis fees 
predictive medicine revenue is recognized upon completion of the test or analysis and communication of results 
up front payments related to marketing agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our predictive medicine products 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment term changes when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debt 
investments in privately held companies 
we review the valuation of our investments in privately held biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for possible impairment as changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment should be assessed 
the amount of impairment  if any  and valuation of these investments are based on our estimates and  in certain circumstances  the completion of independent  third party appraisals of the investments 
inherent in these estimates and appraisals are assumptions such as the comparability of the investee to similar publicly traded companies  the value of the investee s underlying research and development efforts  the likelihood that the investee s current research projects will result in a marketable product  and the investee s expected future cash flows 
accordingly  the amount recognized by us upon ultimate liquidation of these investments may vary significantly from the estimated fair values at june recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
statement r sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 
we currently account for our stock based compensation using the intrinsic method as defined in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and accordingly  we have not recognized any expense for our stock option plans or employee stock purchase plan in our consolidated financial statements as of june   except as discussed below 
statement r became effective for our fiscal year beginning july  in anticipation of adopting statement r  on april  we announced that we had accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options previously awarded to employees and non employee members of the board of directors under the company s and stock option plans 
as a result of the acceleration of vesting for unvested options we do not anticipate that statement r will have a material impact on our financial statements at the time of adoption  but could be material in future periods 
results of operations years ended june  and predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
predictive medicine revenue is comprised primarily of sales of predictive medicine products  and also includes marketing fees and forensic dna analysis fees 
increased sales and marketing efforts  coupled with recent publications concerning the clinical utility of our products  have resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance that predictive medicine revenues will continue to increase at historical rates 
total research revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
related party research revenues included in total research revenues for the fiscal year ended june  and were and million  respectively 
related party research revenue is comprised of certain research services performed for prolexys pharmaceuticals  inc  which is owned by us 
the agreement to provide these research services was terminated effective january  research revenues are comprised of research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements  amortization of upfront technology license fees and milestone payments 
this decrease in total research revenue is primarily attributable to the successful completion of two of our research collaborations with corporate partners 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues may increase or decrease proportionately 
predictive medicine cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in predictive medicine cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our predictive medicine business 
our technology and efficiency improvements also contributed to an increase in our gross profit margin  which was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that predictive medicine gross profit margins will continue to increase at historical rates 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trials in alzheimer s disease and cancer  increases in our other drug discovery and drug development programs  and the initiation of a new research collaboration 
these increases added approximately million to our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by the completion of two of our research collaborations and a prior year settlement of claims resulting from a dispute with a third party  which resulted in decreased research and development expenses of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to fluctuate based on changes in our research programs and the progression of our drug development programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  executive  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  business development  allocated facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
this increase of was primarily attributable to sales and marketing commissions and expenses incurred to support the growth in our predictive medicine business  which resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
general increases in costs to support growth in our predictive medicine business and therapeutic development efforts resulted in an increase of approximately million to our selling  general  and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on the number and scope of new product launches and our drug discovery and drug development efforts 
other expense for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
other expense generally consists of losses realized from the disposition of fixed assets 
for the fiscal year ended june  other expense also included a million impairment charge related to our investment in a privately held pharmaceutical company 
the impairment charge  as determined by our cash flow estimates and an independent  third party appraisal  resulted from a change in the timing of anticipated future cash flows from the investment 
years ended june  and predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
increased sales and marketing efforts  coupled with publications concerning the clinical utility of our products have resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance that predictive medicine revenues will continue to increase at historical rates 
total research revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
related party research revenues included in total research revenues for the fiscal year ended june  and were million and million  respectively 
this decrease in total research revenue is primarily attributable to the successful completion of two of our research collaborations with corporate partners 
predictive medicine cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in predictive medicine cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our predictive medicine business 
our technology and efficiency improvements also contributed to an increase in our gross profit margin  which was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that predictive medicine gross profit margins will continue to increase at historical rates 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trials in alzheimer s disease and prostate cancer  increases in our other drug discovery and drug development programs  the settlement of claims resulting from a dispute with a third party  and increases in internally funded research programs 
these increases added approximately million to our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by the completion of two of our research collaborations  which resulted in decreased research and development expenses of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to general increases in costs to support growth in our predictive medicine business and therapeutic development efforts 
increases in salaries and benefits  facilities costs  bad debt  legal  and other costs resulted in an increase of approximately million to our selling  general  and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by reduced marketing costs from our direct to consumer advertising campaign conducted in the prior fiscal year  resulting in a decrease of approximately million to our selling  general  and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities decreased million or from million at june  to million at june  this decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures for research equipment  increased expenditures for our ongoing clinical trials  internal drug development programs and other expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business 
as a result of changes in interest rates and cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities  interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
net cash used in operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used in operating activities during the prior fiscal year 
prepaid expenses decreased by million between june  and june   primarily due to the usage of lab supplies previously purchased at a discount 
trade receivables increased million between june  and june   primarily due to the increase in predictive medicine sales during the same period 
accounts payable increased by million between june  and june   primarily as a result of purchases of equipment and amounts due in relation to our ongoing clinical trials 
accrued liabilities increased by million between june  and june   partially as a result of the accrual of sales commissions 
our investing activities provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and used cash of million during the prior fiscal year 
investing activities were comprised primarily of purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and capital expenditures for research equipment 
financing activities provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and provided cash of million in the prior fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended june  funds were received from the exercise of stock options and shares sold under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that with our existing capital resources  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors  including the progress of our preclinical and clinical activities  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of our drug discovery and drug development programs  the cost of developing and launching additional predictive medicine products  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the costs associated with competing technological and market developments  the costs associated with potential litigation  the payments received under collaborative agreements and changes in collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of our discoveries  if any  including the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  and the cost and availability of third party financing for capital expenditures and administrative and legal expenses 
on april   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
with the securities and exchange commission for the sale of up to million of various types of securities upon filing of a prospectus supplement with the sec 
the filing was declared effective by the sec on april  this filing includes the securities that had been available for sale under our shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
filed previously on november  because of our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to raise funds when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june   we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements as a whole
