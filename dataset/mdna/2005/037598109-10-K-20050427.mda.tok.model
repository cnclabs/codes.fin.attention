overview we are a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is organized in three segments architectural products and services architectural  large scale optical lso and automotive replacement glass and services auto glass 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass and windows comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  a leading fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation  maintenance and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall  and linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  a value added glass and acrylic manufacturer for the custom framing and pre framed art markets  and a producer of optical thin film coatings for consumer electronics displays 
our auto glass segment consists of viracon curvlite  a us fabricator of aftermarket foreign and domestic car windshields and recreational and bus windshields 
architectural segment 
our architectural segment is the largest and most cyclical segment in our portfolio 
the segment services the commercial construction markets  which we have seen turn around in our most recent fiscal year as compared to the prior two years 
although we outperformed the non residential construction market based on reports by fw dodge  a 
table of contents leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends  we have experienced pricing compression and some isolated job margin deterioration in our window and wall manufacturing and installation businesses  both of which caused lower margins than historical trends 
we are anticipating market conditions to continue to improve somewhat through fiscal based on market forecasts provided by external sources 
our continued efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiencies leaves us optimistic about improved results for this segment in fiscal we are successfully implementing an important strategic initiative to grow architectural commercial glass market share with energy efficient  hurricane and blast products for the office high rise condominium  health care  education and institutional markets 
as a result of progress on our initiatives and the strengthening marketplace  we identified the need for more architectural glass capacity 
at mid year  we committed to investing approximately million to expand our architectural glass fabrication capacity for the potential to achieve an additional million in annual revenue 
we will be better positioned to grow our share and service our core  higher end markets and a portion of the broader market for smaller  shorter lead time projects within miles of our two facilities 
our new capacity is expected to begin full production during the third quarter of fiscal we will consider further geographic expansion to fuel additional growth to grow our share in the core and broader markets 
our second strategy within architectural is to continue to strengthen our businesses that manufacture windows and curtainwall  install glass on new buildings  and renovate and service window and curtainwall systems on older buildings 
much of the focus during fiscal was on our glass installation business which began to streamline part of its operations through centralized manufacturing centers 
we also acquired a leading competitor to strengthen this organization and increase market penetration in the midwest and northwest regions of the united states 
the acquisition  completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  is expected to add about million in annual revenues in the architectural segment 
during fiscal  growing the smaller but more profitable renovation and service sectors of the glass installation business will be a priority 
the six sigma lean business improvement process has been an important part of improvements made in the glass installation business this past year and is key to efforts now underway to make our window and curtainwall business more cost competitive and better able to compete in its fragmented commercial marketplace 
lso segment 
our picture framing strategy of converting the custom framing market to our value added products continues to thrive 
during fiscal  sales of products that protect pictures from fading and or reduce the reflection of glass on artwork again grew by more than percent year over year 
the consolidation of our two large scale optical businesses to focus on the more profitable picture framing business a year ago reduced our costs 
in addition  as the majority of our revenues from consumer electronics were replaced  as planned  this year with higher margin value added picture framing glass sales  our operating earnings increased significantly 
we continue to strengthen our partnerships with the nation s largest art and craft retailer  which is a major apogee customer  and key independent distributors 
we work closely with some key customers to promote the benefits of value added framing products to their customers 
a priority is to develop these types of mutually beneficial relationships with other leaders in the custom framing industry 
at the same time  we continue to identify partners to help us grow our international framing business 
auto glass segment 
although our remaining auto glass manufacturing business and our distribution joint venture with ppg face difficult market conditions that have lowered volume and pricing  we expect they will generate cash for apogee during fiscal in july  with the expiration of our supply agreement  our manufacturing business will be transitioning from its multi year supply agreement with ppg back to the independent distributor marketplace  which values our short lead times for aftermarket auto windshields  we do not expect to be entering into a new long term supply agreement with ppg when the current contract expires in july company wide  our businesses used six sigma lean  one of our strategies to reduce overhead  to save more than million in fiscal to help offset cost increases 
other elements of the strategy to achieve significant cost savings moving forward include purchasing and information technology initiatives 
results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales increased percent in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the net increase was primarily attributable to market share gains  some improvements in the commercial construction markets which resulted in higher volume  a higher value mix and reduced job delays within the architectural segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales decreased percent in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the net decrease was primarily attributable to volume reductions and lower pricing due to competitive pressures in the architectural segment  and the continued slowdown in the commercial construction industry 
weak conditions in the commercial construction market caused projects to delay throughout the year  resulting in a continual delay in the activity and  accordingly  adversely impacting revenues recognized in fiscal performance the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income  net equity in loss of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net earnings loss effective income tax rate for continuing operations nm nm not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to percent for fiscal  from percent in fiscal the primary factor for the resulting increase in margins is due to the higher level of activity in the architectural segment which allowed for increased capacity utilization 
the stronger commercial construction market also resulted in more consistent project flow 
additionally  the large scale optical segment had a much higher mix of value added glass 
also  the net proceeds of million from a class action lawsuit settlement with certain flat glass manufacturers with respect to glass purchases from to  increased the fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales by percentage points 
offsetting these increases were the effects of the termination in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the pricing amendments to the company s supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture  which negatively impacted the auto glass segment s results and the company s gross profit percentage by percentage points  while positively offsetting equity in income of affiliated companies 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to percent from percent despite increased spending to million  from million in fiscal the primary drivers for the increased costs were a result of incentive compensation expenses and impairment charges related to disposition of certain fixed assets  offset by lower consulting  salary and wages due to cost saving efforts 
the increase in interest income is the result of a federal income tax refund received during fiscal despite an increased  weighted average interest rate under our revolving credit agreement  interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of lower borrowing levels 
other income in fiscal was million versus million in the prior year  which reflected the pretax benefit of realized gains on the sale of investments held for our self insurance program 

table of contents equity in affiliated companies reflects our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc  and includes a loss of million in fiscal  versus a loss of million in fiscal the results for fiscal reflect a million positive effect of the termination of the pricing amendments for the year  which was more than offset by unfavorable market conditions resulting in reduced volume and lower pricing 
income tax expense was million in fiscal versus our income tax benefit of million in fiscal both fiscal year statutory tax rates of percent were offset by tax credits and other deductions realized for tax that did not require book expense 
for fiscal  the most significant offsets related to research and development tax credits and a higher valuation of a charitable donation of a patent donated in fiscal our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  in fiscal the significant increase in earnings was the result of improved economic conditions and performance against the identified strategic initiatives in the architectural and picture framing businesses 
fiscal results from discontinued operations were million  compared to a loss of million or diluted earnings per share in fiscal fiscal results include a loss on the sale of harmon auto glass and costs associated with the exit of the business totaling million  or per diluted share 
the remaining loss of million  or per share  represented harmon autoglass s operating results for the period in which we owned harmon autoglass 
our fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to a net loss of million  or diluted earnings per share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent for fiscal  from percent in fiscal the primary factors for the percentage point decrease in margins were the effects of the slowed commercial construction market affecting the architectural segment  resulting in reduced volume pricing pressures  as well as project management issues encountered at our glass installation business 
additionally  the lso segment recognized integration costs and a charge associated with the sale of its matboard product line that  collectively  resulted in a percentage point impact 
these costs were offset by increased sales of higher value added products in the lso segment 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to percent from percent as expenses declined year over year from million to million in fiscal nearly all of the decreases occurred in the architectural segment as a result of lower performance based incentive expenses  and lower salary and wage related expenses from reduced headcount 
these were offset by increases in outside consulting fees and lower gains from sales of non strategic assets in the current year versus the prior period 
net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting lower borrowing levels and a lower weighted average interest rate under our revolving credit agreement 
other income in fiscal was only million versus million in the prior year  which reflected the pretax benefit of realized gains on the sale of investments held for our self insurance program in fiscal as part of normal investment portfolio management  our wholly owned insurance subsidiary sold appreciated marketable debt securities  creating this gain in the prior period 
our equity in loss from affiliated companies was million in fiscal  versus equity in loss of million in the prior year 
the additional loss is related to a decline in the performance of the ppg auto glass joint venture as a result of a very competitive auto glass replacement industry  which has experienced reduced volume and lower pricing 
our income tax benefit of million in the current year represents a statutory tax rate of percent offset by tax credits and other deductions realized for tax that did not require book expense  the most significant of which related to research and development tax credits and a higher valuation of a charitable donation of a patent donated in fiscal our fiscal earnings from continuing operations decreased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the decrease in earnings is largely attributable to the revenue decline and operational issues in our architectural segment 
current year loss from discontinued operations was million or diluted earnings per share  compared to million in earnings or diluted earnings per share in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we announced plans to sell harmon autoglass 
during the third quarter  we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business to synergistic international  inc  a subsidiary of the dwyer group of waco  texas  and the sale was finalized during the fourth quarter

the current year results include a loss on the sale of harmon auto glass and costs associated with the exit of the business totaling million  or per diluted share 
the remaining loss of million  or per share  represents harmon autoglass s operating results for the period in which we owned harmon autoglass 
the prior year total includes a loss from operations of harmon autoglass of million  or per share  offset by income of million  or per diluted share  related to a reduction in our estimates of the ultimate liabilities for the discontinued european curtainwall operation described under discontinued operations below

segment analysis architectural products and services architectural in thousands net sales operating income loss operating income loss as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal architectural net sales for fiscal increased percent to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to increased market share in our core markets  increased market penetration in the broader markets and fewer project delays than in the prior year 
additionally  we experienced market improvements  especially in the high end condominium  government and institutional work  along with some improvement in the office market 
these projects also are using more value added hurricane  blast and energy efficient products that helped improve our product mix 
also contributing to increased revenues for the segment was the acquisition of awalls  which was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal this acquisition added approximately million to segment revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal see
