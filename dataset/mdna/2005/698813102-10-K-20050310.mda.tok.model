marketing programs all company owned and franchised papa john s restaurants within a co developed market are required to join an area advertising cooperative co op 
each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the co op for market wide programs  such as radio  television and print advertising 
the rate of contribution and uses of the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the co op s members 
the restaurant level and co op marketing efforts are supported by print and electronic advertising materials that are produced by the papa john s marketing fund  inc  a non profit corporation the marketing fund 
the marketing fund produces and buys air time for papa john s national television commercials  in addition to other brand building activities  such as consumer research 
all domestic company owned and franchised papa john s restaurants are required to contribute a percentage of sales to the marketing fund 
the contribution percentage was from january through may  increasing to in june the contribution percentages in and were and  respectively 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  the contribution percentage to the marketing fund decreased to 
restaurant level marketing programs target the delivery area of each restaurant  making extensive use of targeted print materials in direct mail and store to door couponing 
the local marketing efforts also include a variety of community oriented activities with schools  sports teams and other organizations 
in markets in which papa john s has a significant presence  local marketing efforts are supplemented with radio and television advertising 
we provide both company owned and franchised restaurants with catalogs for the purchase of uniforms and promotional items and pre approved print marketing materials 
we also provide direct marketing services to company owned and franchised restaurants using customer information gathered by our proprietary point of sale technology see company operations point of sale technology 
we have developed a system by which all domestic papa john s restaurant customers are able to place orders on line via the internet 
we receive a percentage fee based on on line sales from domestic franchisees  in addition to royalties  for this service 
in november  we began offering our customers the opportunity to purchase a reloadable gift card  papa card that can be purchased in any denomination between and the papa card may be redeemed for delivery  carryout and on line orders and is accepted at substantially all papa john s traditional us restaurants 
company operations restaurant personnel 
a typical papa john s restaurant employs a restaurant manager  one or two assistant managers and approximately to hourly team members  most of whom work part time 
the manager is responsible for the day to day operation of the restaurant and maintaining company established operating standards 
the operating standards and other resources are contained in a comprehensive operations manual supplied to each restaurant 
we seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and staff  provide comprehensive training on operations and managerial skills  and motivate and retain them by providing opportunities for advancement and performance based financial incentives 
we also employ directors of operations who are responsible for overseeing an average of seven company owned restaurants 
these team members are eligible to earn performance based financial incentives 
training and education 
we have a department dedicated to training and developing team members  as well as assisting with new restaurant openings 
with regional training locations across the country  we are capable of training multiple operators during new program or product introductions 
we provide an on site training team three days before and three days after the opening of any company owned or franchised restaurant requesting assistance 
operations personnel  both corporate and franchise  complete our management training program and on going development programs in which instruction is given on all aspects of our systems and operations 
the programs include hands on training and some classroom instruction at an operating papa john s restaurant by a company certified general training manager 
our training includes new team member orientation  in store and delivery training  core management skills training  new product or program implementation and ongoing developmental programs 
point of sale technology 
point of sale technology our proprietary profit system tm is in place in all domestic traditional papa john s restaurants and in substantially all papa john s international restaurants 
we believe this technology facilitates faster and more accurate order taking and pricing  reduces paperwork and allows the restaurant manager to better monitor and control food and labor costs 
we believe the profit system enhances restaurant level marketing capabilities through the development of a database containing information on customers and their buying habits with respect to our products 
polling capabilities allow us to obtain restaurant operating information  thereby improving the speed  accuracy and efficiency of restaurant level reporting 
during  we introduced a new generation of the profit system to the domestic and international papa john s system 
this updated version was designed to improve operational efficiencies at the restaurant level and improve our data collection process 
we expect the updated profit system to be installed in substantially all domestic company owned and franchised restaurants by mid reporting 
management at company owned restaurants evaluates daily reports of sales  cash deposits and operating costs 
physical inventories of all food and beverage items are taken nightly 
joint venture 
we operate company owned restaurants under two joint venture arrangements 
under the first arrangement  we own of papa john s restaurants located in northern virginia 
we entered into the second arrangement during in which we retained ownership in company owned restaurants located in texas 
we will continue to evaluate further joint venture arrangements on an individual basis as opportunities arise 
hours of operations 
our domestic restaurants are open seven days a week  typically from am to am monday through thursday  am to am on friday and saturday and noon to am on sunday 
franchise program general 
we continue to attract franchisees with significant restaurant and retail experience 
we consider our franchisees to be a vital part of our system s continued growth and believe our relationship with our franchisees is good 
as of december   there were  franchised papa john s restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and countries  and franchised perfect pizza restaurants operating in the united kingdom 
as of december   we have development agreements with our domestic franchisees for approximately additional franchised restaurants committed to open through and agreements for additional international franchised restaurants to open through there can be no assurance that all of these restaurants will be opened or that the development schedule set forth in the development agreements will be achieved 
there are no formal development agreements for franchised perfect pizza restaurants and we anticipate opening minimal perfect pizza units in the future 
our plan is to attract new franchisees  and to work with existing franchisees  to open new papa john s restaurants in the united kingdom 
during  domestic and international franchised papa john s restaurants were opened  and two perfect pizza franchised restaurants were opened 
our franchisees have converted perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s restaurants since approval 
franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant s business background  restaurant operating experience and financial resources 
we seek franchisees to enter into development agreements for single or multiple restaurants 
we require the franchisee to either complete our training program or to hire a full time operator who completes the training and has either an equity interest or the right to acquire an equity interest in the franchise operation 
development and franchise agreements 
we enter into development agreements with our domestic franchisees for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area 
under our current standard development agreement  the franchisee is required to pay  at the time of signing the agreement  a non refundable fee of  for the first restaurant and  for any additional restaurants 
the non refundable fee is credited against the standard  franchise fee payable to us upon signing the franchise agreement for a specific location 
generally  a franchise agreement is executed when a franchisee secures a location 
our current standard domestic franchise agreement provides for a term of ten years with one ten year renewal option and payment to us of a royalty fee of of sales 
the current agreement  as well as substantially all existing franchise agreements  permits us to increase the royalty fee up to of sales 
the royalty fee cannot be increased to an amount greater than the percentage royalty fee then in effect for new franchisees 
we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons  including a franchisee s failure to make payments when due or failure to adhere to our policies and standards 
many state franchise laws limit the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise 
we opened our first franchised restaurant outside the united states in we define international markets to be all markets outside the contiguous united states in which we have either a development agreement or a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area  therefore  a country could be divided into multiple markets 
under a master franchise agreement  the franchisee has the right to subfranchise a portion of the development to one or more subfranchisees approved by us 
under our current standard international development agreement except for hawaii and alaska in which the initial fees are the same as domestic restaurants  the franchisee is required to pay total fees of  per restaurant   at the time of signing the agreement  and  when the restaurant opens or the agreed upon development date  whichever comes first 
under our current standard master franchise agreement  the master franchisee is required to pay total fees of  per restaurant owned and operated by the master franchisee  under the same terms as the development agreement  and  for each subfranchised restaurant   at the time of signing the agreement and  when the restaurant opens or the agreed upon development date  whichever comes first 
our current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty fee of of sales including sales by subfranchised restaurants  with no provision for increase 
the remaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our standard domestic franchise agreement 
from time to time  development agreements will be negotiated at other than standard terms for fees and royalties 
we franchise restaurants in the united kingdom under perfect pizza franchise agreements  which were in effect at the time of our acquisition in these franchise agreements differ from our standard international franchise agreements in many respects  although with few material differences 
a principal difference is the term of the agreement  which is five years 
the franchise fee is  approximately  at an exchange rate of as of december   and the royalty rate of is the same as in our standard international agreements 
the perfect pizza system has been developed principally through franchising of individual restaurants to single location franchisees 
thus  the system historically had no equivalent to our development agreements or master franchise agreements 
we have entered into a limited number of development and franchise agreements for non traditional restaurant units and continue to analyze opportunities to expand these types of units 
these agreements generally cover venues or areas not originally targeted for development and have terms differing from the standard agreement 
these agreements have not had a significant impact on our revenues or earnings 
franchise restaurant development 
we provide assistance to papa john s franchisees in selecting sites  developing restaurants and evaluating the physical specifications for typical restaurants 
each franchisee is responsible for selecting the location for its restaurants but must obtain our approval of restaurant design and location based on accessibility and visibility of the site and targeted demographic factors  including population  density  income  age and traffic 
our domestic franchisees may purchase complete new store equipment packages through an approved third party supplier under a commission arrangement with the company 
internationally  our franchisees buy their equipment from approved third party suppliers 
franchisee loans 
selected franchisees have borrowed funds from our subsidiary  capital delivery  ltd  principally for use in the construction and development of their restaurants 
we have also entered into loan agreements with certain franchisees that purchased restaurants from us or other franchisees 
loans made to franchisees typically bear interest at fixed or floating rates with a stated average interest rate of at december  and in most cases are secured by the fixtures  equipment and signage and where applicable  the land of the restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchisee 
at december   franchisee loans outstanding totaled million million of net loans were eliminated upon consolidating franchisee variable interest entities or vies  net of a million reserve for uncollectible amounts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have a commitment to lend up to million to bibp  a franchisee owned corporation 
we have an outstanding loan of million to bibp at december   which is eliminated in consolidation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
franchise insurance program 
our franchisees have the opportunity to purchase various insurance policies  such as non owned automobile and workers compensation  through our insurance agency  risk services corp 
risk services 
in october  we established a captive insurance company located in bermuda  rsc insurance services  ltd  to accommodate this business 
beginning in october  a third party commercial insurance company began providing fully insured coverage to franchisees participating in the franchise insurance program 
accordingly  this new agreement eliminates our risk of loss for franchise insurance coverage written after september as of december   approximately of domestic franchise restaurants had obtained insurance coverage through risk services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
franchise training and support 
every franchisee is required to have a principal operator approved by us who satisfactorily completes our required training program and who devotes his or her full business time and efforts to the operation of the franchisee s restaurants 
each franchise restaurant manager is also required to complete our company certified management training program 
we provide an on site training crew three days before and three days after the opening of a franchisee s first two restaurants 
ongoing supervision of training is monitored by the franchise training team 
multi unit franchisees are encouraged to appoint training store general managers or hire a full time training coordinator certified to deliver company approved programs in order to train new team members and management candidates for their restaurants 
our area franchise directors maintain open communication with the franchise community  relaying operating and marketing information and new ideas between franchisees and us 
internationally  training is monitored by our international director of training as well as regional directors and international business managers assigned to specific franchisee territories 
we also maintain communications with our franchisees through periodic system wide meetings and newsletters 
franchise operations 
all franchisees are required to operate their papa john s restaurants in compliance with our policies  standards and specifications  including matters such as menu items  ingredients  materials  supplies  services  fixtures  furnishings  decor and signs 
each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to its customers 
franchise advisory council 
we have a franchise advisory council that consists of company and franchisee representatives of domestically owned restaurants 
the advisory council and subcommittees hold regular meetings to discuss new marketing ideas  operations  growth and other relevant issues 
we currently communicate with  and receive input from  our franchisees in several forms  including through the company s franchise advisory council  annual operations conferences and various regional meetings conducted with franchisees throughout the year and participation in an operators exchange best practices forum in which numerous franchisees also participate 
we are committed to communicating with  and receiving input from  our franchisees regardless of the venue or form such communications may ultimately take 
reporting and business processes 
we collect weekly and monthly sales and other operating information from papa john s franchisees 
we have agreements with substantially all papa john s domestic franchisees permitting us to debit electronically the franchisees bank accounts for substantially all payments to us including the payment of royalties  marketing fund contributions  risk management services  and purchases from our print and promotions operations and qc centers 
this system significantly reduces the resources needed to process receivables  improves cash flow and mitigates the amount of past due accounts related to these items 
franchisees generally are required to purchase and install the papa john s profit system in their restaurants see company operations point of sale technology 
industry and competition the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price  service  location and food quality  and there are many well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than papa john s 
competitors include a large number of international  national and regional restaurant chains  as well as local pizza operators 
some of our competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than us and may be better established in the markets where our restaurants are  or may be located 
based on independent third party research  the united states quick service restaurant qsr pizza category  which includes dine in  carry out and delivery  had sales of approximately billion in  of which papa john s share was reported as 
within the pizza segment of the restaurant industry  we believe our primary competitors are the national pizza chains  including pizza hut  domino s and little caesars  and several regional chains  including chains executing a take and bake concept 
a change in the pricing or other marketing strategies of one or more of our competitors could have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings 
additionally  a continued increased emphasis on carryout business by traditional casual dining restaurants  such as applebee s and outback  as well as improved quality of fresh and frozen supermarket offerings  could also have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings 
with respect to the sale of franchises  we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts 
in general  there is also active competition for management personnel and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for our restaurants 
government regulation we  along with our franchisees  are subject to various federal  state and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses 
each papa john s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities  which include health  safety  sanitation  building and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
difficulties in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area 
our full service qc centers are licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes  and the operation of our trucks is subject to department of transportation regulations 
we are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations 
we are subject to federal trade commission ftc regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
several state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
the ftc requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing prescribed information 
substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states  and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time  which would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor franchisee relationship in certain respects 
the state laws often limit  among other things  the duration and scope of non competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise 
some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor franchisee relationship 
further government initiatives  such as living wage or other proposed increases in minimum wage rates  could adversely affect papa john s as well as the restaurant industry 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where franchised units are established 
trademarks our rights in our principal trademarks and service marks are a significant part of our business 
we are the owner of the federal registration of the trademark papa john s 
we have also registered pizza papa john s and design our logo  better ingredients 
better pizza 
and pizza papa john s better ingredients 
better pizza 
and design as trademarks and service marks 
we also own federal registrations for several ancillary marks  principally advertising slogans 
we have also applied to register our primary trademark  pizza papa john s and design  in more than foreign countries and the european community 
the perfect pizza trademark is also registered in the united kingdom 
we are aware of the use by other persons in certain geographical areas of names and marks which are the same as or similar to our marks 
it is our policy to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks 
employees as of december   we employed  persons  of whom approximately  were restaurant team members  were restaurant management and supervisory personnel  were corporate personnel and were qc center and support services personnel 
most restaurant team members work part time and are paid on an hourly basis 
none of our team members is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our team member relations to be excellent 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act  including information within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  the following the ability of the papa john s system to continue to open new restaurants is affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among other things  selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations  increases in food  paper  labor  utilities  fuel  employee benefits  insurance and similar costs  negotiation of suitable lease or financing terms  constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants  higher than anticipated construction costs  and the hiring  training and retention of management and other personnel 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that system wide  papa john s will be able to meet planned growth targets  open restaurants in markets now targeted for expansion  or continue to operate in existing markets profitably 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price  service  location and food quality  and there are many well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the papa john s system 
some of these competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than papa john s and may be better established in the markets where restaurants operated by us or our franchisees are  or may be  located 
experience has shown that a change in the pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies  including new product and concept developments  of one or more of our major competitors can have an adverse impact on sales and earnings of papa john s and our system wide restaurant operations 
an increase in the cost of cheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system wide restaurant operations 
cheese costs  historically representing to of our food cost  and other commodities are subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  availability  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
additionally  sustained increases in fuel and utility costs could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and qc center businesses 
changes in consumer taste for example  changes in dietary preferences that could cause consumers to avoid pizza in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthful  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants could adversely affect our restaurant business 
health or disease related disruptions or consumer concerns about the commodity supply could negatively impact the availability and or cost of such commodities  thereby adversely impacting restaurant operations and our financial results 
system wide restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime 
a significant number of hourly personnel employed by our franchisees and us are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
accordingly  further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local living wage proposals will increase labor costs for our system wide operations 
additionally  labor shortages in various markets could result in higher required wage rates 
any or all of the factors listed in through potentially adversely impacting restaurant sales or costs could be especially harmful to the financial viability of franchisees in under penetrated or emerging markets 
a decline in or failure to improve financial performance for this group of franchisees could lead to unit closings at greater than anticipated levels and therefore impact contributions to marketing funds  our royalty stream  pjfs and support services efficiencies and other system wide results 
domestically  we are dependent on sole suppliers for our cheese  flour and thin crust dough products 
alternative sources for these ingredients may not be available on a timely basis to supply these key ingredients or be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements 
domestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our qc centers 
accordingly  both our corporate and franchised restaurants could be harmed by any prolonged disruption in the supply of products from our qc centers 
additionally  domestic franchisees are only required to purchase seasoned sauce and dough from our qc centers and changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees could adversely affect the financial results of our qc centers 
beginning in october of  a third party commercial insurance company began providing fully insured coverage to franchisees participating in our franchise insurance program  thus eliminating our risk of loss for franchise insurance coverage written after september the captive s relatively immature claims history limits the predictive value of estimating the costs of incurred and future claims  thus our operating income is subject to potential significant adjustments for changes in estimated insurance reserves for policies written from the captive s inception in october through september our domestic and international operations could be negatively impacted by significant changes in international economic and political conditions 
in addition  our international operations are subject to additional factors  including currency regulations and fluctuations  cultures and consumer preferences  diverse government regulations and structures  availability and cost of land and construction  ability to source ingredients and other commodities in a cost effective manner  and differing interpretation of the obligations established in franchise agreements with international franchisees 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our operations will achieve or maintain profitability or meet planned growth rates

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction papa john s international  inc referred to as the company  papa john s or in the first person notations of we  us and our began operations in with the opening of the first papa john s restaurant in jeffersonville  indiana 
at december   there were  papa john s restaurants in operation  consisting of company owned and  franchised  and franchised perfect pizza restaurants in the united kingdom 
our revenues are principally derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and beverage products to the general public by company owned restaurants  franchise royalties  sales of franchise and development rights  sales to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  risk management services  and information systems and related services used in their operations 
new unit openings in were as compared to in and in and unit closings in were as compared to in and in several factors have resulted in minimal net unit growth over the past three years  including the competitive sales environment  operating margin pressures due to increased wages  insurance and other costs and the overall economic environment including franchisees access to capital 
we expect future unit expansion to be impacted by these and other factors 
we have continued to produce strong average sales from our company owned restaurants even with a very competitive market environment 
our expansion strategy is to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
average company owned sales for our most recent quarter s comparable base restaurants were  for  compared to  for and  for average sales volumes in new markets are generally lower than in those markets in which we have established a significant market position 
the comparable annual sales for company owned restaurants increased in  decreased in and increased in we continually strive to obtain high quality sites with good access and visibility  and to enhance the appearance and quality of our restaurants 
we believe that these factors improve our image and brand awareness 
the average cash investment for the restaurants in our most recent comparable sales base is  the average cash investment for the six domestic company owned restaurants opened during  exclusive of land  decreased to approximately  from  for the ten units opened in we expect the average cash investment for the anticipated four company owned restaurants opening in to be approximately  approximately of our revenues for  and were derived from the sale to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  risk management services and information systems equipment and software and related services by us  our commissary subsidiary  pj food service  inc pjfs  our support services subsidiary  papa john s support services  inc  our insurance subsidiaries  rsc insurance services  ltd 
and risk services corp 
and our united kingdom subsidiary  papa john s uk 
we believe that  in addition to supporting both company and franchised growth  these subsidiaries contribute to product quality and consistency and restaurant profitability throughout the papa john s system 
our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in december of each year 
all fiscal years presented consist of weeks 
results of operations and critical accounting policies and estimates the results of operations are based on the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in assumptions and or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact the operating results 
we have identified the following accounting policies and related judgments as critical to understanding the results of our operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts and notes receivable based on overall receivable aging levels and a specific evaluation of accounts and notes for franchisees with known financial difficulties 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if the identified franchisees continue to experience deteriorating financial results 
long lived and intangible assets the recoverability of long lived assets is evaluated annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
indicators of impairment include historical financial performance  operating trends and our future operating plans 
if impairment indicators exist  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets on an operating unit basis eg  an individual restaurant based on undiscounted expected future cash flows before interest for the expected remaining useful life of the operating unit 
recorded values for long lived assets that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows are written down to current fair value  which is generally determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows for assets held for use or net realizable value for assets held for sale 
the recoverability of intangible assets ie  goodwill is evaluated annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist  on a reporting unit basis by comparing the fair value derived from discounted cash flows of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
at december   we had a net investment of approximately million associated with pjuk  our united kingdom subsidiary  which was substantially composed of goodwill associated with our acquisition of the subsidiary 
pjuk has reported deteriorating operating results for the past two years primarily due to lower sales by perfect pizza restaurants and a decrease in net franchise units due to restaurant closings 
we have developed plans for pjuk to improve its operating results  which include an anticipated increase in net franchise unit openings over the next several years 
if these plans are not successful and operating results continue to deteriorate  we may be required to record a significant impairment charge associated with our united kingdom subsidiary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
insurance reserves our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  owned and non owned automobiles and health insurance coverage provided to our employees  and the captive insurance program provided to our franchisees are self insured up to certain individual and aggregate reinsurance levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate retained liability for claims incurred using certain third party actuarial projections and our claims loss experience 
the estimated insurance claims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims significantly differ from historical trends used to estimate the insurance reserves recorded by the company 
effective october  a third party commercial insurance company began providing fully insured coverage to franchisees participating in the franchise insurance program and we ceased providing new coverage via our captive insurance subsidiary 
accordingly  this new arrangement eliminates our risk of loss for franchise insurance coverage written after september our operating income will still be subject to potential adjustments for changes in estimated insurance reserves for policies written from october to september such adjustments  if any  will be determined in part based upon semi annual actuarial valuations 
our captive insurance company recorded increases in existing claims loss reserves of million and million in and  respectively  as compared to expected claims costs  based on updated actuarial valuations

as required by the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin  we began consolidating the financial results of bibp in the fourth quarter of we recognized pre tax losses of approximately million during from the consolidation of bibp 
we expect the consolidation of bibp to continue to have a significant impact on papa john s operating income in future periods due to the volatility of cheese prices 
papa john s will recognize the operating losses generated by bibp if the shareholders equity of bibp is in a net deficit position 
further  papa john s will recognize subsequent operating income generated by bibp up to the amount of bibp losses previously recognized by papa john s 
lease expense recognition the company recently completed a comprehensive review of its accounting for lease expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements 
our review resulted in a cumulative fourth quarter adjustment increasing rent and depreciation expense by million or per share  after tax applicable to prior periods  of which million or per share  after tax was applicable to years prior to this accounting adjustment does not affect the company s historical or future cash flows or the timing or amounts of rental payments 
additionally  this correction is not material to prior periods 
we do not expect this accounting adjustment to have a significant impact on future operating earnings

fin as previously discussed  fin addresses the potential consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
the provisions of fin significantly alter the method for evaluating whether certain vies  as defined  should be consolidated in a company s financial statements 
as noted above  we began consolidating bibp at december  a cumulative effect adjustment was not required with the adoption of fin as bibp had a surplus in stockholders equity at december  papa john s is also the primary beneficiary  as defined by fin  of four franchise entities representing papa john s restaurants that qualify as vies  even though we have no ownership interest in them 
we began consolidating these four franchise entities in the second quarter of  as required by fin the consolidation of these four entities resulted in the recording of goodwill of million 
the consolidation of the entities had no significant impact on our operating results during and we do not expect our future operating earnings to be significantly impacted by consolidating these four entities

compared to variable interest entities as required by fin  our operating results include bibp s operating results 
the consolidation of bibp had a significant impact on our operating results in and is expected to have a significant ongoing impact on our future operating results and income statement presentation as described below 
consolidation accounting requires the net impact from the consolidation of bibp to be reflected primarily in two separate components of our statement of income 
the first component is the portion of bibp operating income or loss attributable to the amount of cheese purchased by company owned restaurants during the period 
this portion of bibp operating income loss is reflected as a reduction increase in the domestic company owned restaurant expenses cost of sales line item 
this approach effectively reports cost of sales for company owned restaurants as if the purchasing arrangement with bibp did not exist and such restaurants were purchasing cheese at the spot market prices ie  the impact of bibp is eliminated in consolidation 
the second component of the net impact from the consolidation of bibp is reflected in the caption loss from the franchise cheese purchasing program  net of minority interest 
this line item represents bibp s income or loss from purchasing cheese at the spot market price and selling to franchised restaurants at a fixed quarterly price  net of any income or loss attributable to the minority interest bibp shareholders 
the amount of income or loss attributable to the bibp shareholders depends on its cumulative shareholders equity balance and the change in such balance during the reporting period 
in addition  we have extended loans to certain franchisees 
under the fin rules  papa john s is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of four of these franchisees  even though we have no ownership interest in them 
beginning in the second quarter of  fin required us to recognize the operating income losses generated by these four franchise entities representing papa john s restaurants 
the consolidation of these four franchise entities had no net significant impact on papa john s operating results in  generating revenues of million and operating expenses including general and administrative  depreciation and interest of approximately the same amount 
summary of operating results total revenues increased to million in compared to million in primarily consisting of million from the consolidation of franchised restaurants beginning in the second quarter of resulting from the implementation of fin  million from commissary sales reflecting the sales of promotional items principally dvds and the favorable impact of higher commodity prices  primarily cheese  partially offset by lower sales volumes and million from the first quarter sales of promotional items associated with our march ncaa national basketball promotion 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in domestic company owned restaurant sales of million in  as compared to  primarily as a result of the closing of restaurants during the last quarter of our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased to million in  from million in the decrease is principally due to the consolidation of bibp in  which resulted in a pre tax loss of million per share 
the comparison of to was also impacted by the following the results included a million restaurant closure  impairment and disposition charge none of significance in 
the results included a loss of million from the franchise insurance program while the loss in was million 
net interest expense declined million in due in part to the  benefit recorded pursuant to sfas no 
 associated with a change in a joint venture operating agreement during  which eliminated a mandatory purchase requirement and related liability 
the remainder of the decrease in interest expense is due to lower average debt balances and lower effective interest rates 
the results included a million contribution to the marketing fund and a  sales incentive to franchisees as compared to a contribution of  to the marketing fund in the favorable year over year impact of the above items was partially offset by a reduction in commissary results of approximately million in  as compared to  as a result of lower sales volumes due to a reduction in the number of restaurant transactions 
the favorable impact was further offset by a reduction in full year operating income of approximately million  as a result of certain lease and leasehold accounting adjustments applicable to prior years 
diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were compared to in in december  we began a repurchase program for our common stock 
through december   an aggregate of million shares have been repurchased representing million shares  at an average price of per share 
the share repurchase activity increased earnings per share by approximately for full year review of operating results revenues 
domestic company owned restaurant sales decreased to million in  from million for the comparable period in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in equivalent units for  as we closed underperforming restaurants during  partially offset by a increase in comparable sales 
equivalent units represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given period  adjusted for restaurants opened  closed  acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis 
variable interest entities restaurant sales include restaurant sales for four franchise entities to which we have extended loans that qualify as vies 
we began consolidating the operating results of these entities in the second quarter of domestic franchise royalties increased to million from million for the comparable period in domestic franchise sales increased to billion in  from billion for the comparable period in the increase for the period is due to average unit volumes increasing slightly due to new units opening at higher sales levels relative to closed units

other sales increased to million for  from million for the comparable period in  primarily as a result of an increase in revenues associated with insurance related services provided to franchisees and the promotional item sales associated with our march ncaa basketball national promotion 
international revenues primarily consist of the papa john s united kingdom uk operations  denominated in british pounds sterling and converted to us dollars of total international revenues 
international revenues increased to million in  from million  as revenues from increased franchise unit openings and the impact of a more favorable dollar pound exchange rate were partially offset by a decrease in corporate restaurant revenues due to the operation of only one company owned restaurant during as compared to an average of five restaurants for the comparable period in costs and expenses 
the restaurant operating margin at domestic company owned units was for compared to in  consisting of the following differences as a percent of company owned restaurant sales cost of sales was higher as a percentage of sales in primarily due to the consolidation of bibp  which increased cost of sales in the remaining increase in cost of sales is due to higher cheese costs charged by bibp  partially offset by lower costs for other commodities as a result of various product cost savings initiatives and the impact of restaurant pricing increases 
salaries and benefits were lower as a percentage of sales in due to staffing efficiencies and leverage on restaurant pricing increases 
advertising and related costs  occupancy costs and other operating expenses were relatively flat as a percentage of sales 
domestic commissary and other margin was for compared to for cost of sales was of revenues in compared to in primarily due to higher cheese costs incurred by our commissaries cheese has a fixed dollar  as opposed to fixed percentage  mark up and increased sales of lower margin products  such as promotional items principally dvds and the items sold in the first quarter related to the march ncaa national promotion 
salaries and benefits were lower as a percentage of sales  in as compared to in due to staffing efficiencies and the impact of higher cheese prices on sales

international operating margin increased to in from in  primarily due to the disposition of company owned restaurants  which had a lower operating margin than our commissary operation  expense leverage on the increased franchise unit openings and an improvement in commissary operating margins 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues for as compared to million or of revenues for this million increase was primarily attributable to the previously mentioned million rent expense adjustment associated with leases the remaining  of the adjustment associated with our review of leases was recorded in depreciation expense  a million increase in bonuses to corporate and restaurant management who met pre established goals for their operating units  a million increase in compensation expense related to stock options awarded in late that vest over a month period throughout  a million increase in administrative costs associated with our expanded domestic franchise sales efforts   of severance and other costs associated with staffing reductions during the fourth quarter of and million of administrative expenses associated with variable interest entities now required to be consolidated 
these increases were partially offset by lower insurance and benefit costs  and savings related to various administrative efficiencies implemented throughout a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of  was recorded in as compared to million in these provisions were based on our evaluation of our franchise loan portfolio  and primarily relate to specific loans for which certain scheduled payments have been deferred as part of an overall workout arrangement

international revenues decreased to million in compared to million in  as lower company owned restaurant and commissary sales were substantially offset by a favorable exchange rate impact of million and increased royalties 
costs and expenses 
the restaurant operating margin at domestic company owned units was for compared to in  consisting of the following differences as a percent of company owned restaurant sales cost of sales was lower in primarily due to lower cheese costs  partially offset by portion increases for several core pizza products implemented during the second quarter of salaries and benefits were higher in reflecting the impact of an across the board increase in base pay for general managers and assistant managers implemented during the third quarter of  the loss of leverage on fixed salaries due to the decrease in average unit sales and increased health insurance costs 
additionally  in connection with the field management realignment announced in january  we increased restaurant staffing levels and general manager and assistant manager bonus potential 
advertising and related costs were higher in primarily due to increases in national spending and lower than anticipated sales 
occupancy costs were higher in primarily as a result of increased utility and general insurance costs combined with lower sales 
other operating expenses were relatively consistent as a percentage of sales lower in 
domestic commissary and other margin was for compared to in cost of sales was of revenues in compared to in primarily due to lower food costs incurred by the commissaries principally cheese  which has a fixed dollar as opposed to a fixed percentage markup  a decrease in lower margin equipment sales and an increase in the revenues from insurance related services provided to franchisees

the increment over libor and the commitment fee are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
cash flow from operations decreased to million in compared to million in approximately million of the decrease is attributable to the consolidation of bibp as reflected in the net income and deferred income taxes captions in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows  and the remaining decrease is primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes  including increased levels of prepaid insurance due to the timing of payments and general premium increases  increased accounts receivable due to an extension of the timing of collections of certain items such as systems hardware and dvd s from franchisees  and increased inventory levels due to a change in payment terms with a significant supplier and generally higher commodity costs primarily cheese

impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs  particularly commodities  labor  benefits  insurance  utilities and fuel  could have a significant impact on us 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this annual report  particularly information regarding future financial performance and plans and objectives of management  is forward looking 
certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to the uncertainties associated with litigation  increases in projected claims losses for the company s self insured coverage or within the captive franchise insurance program  increased advertising promotions and discounting by competitors which may adversely affect sales  new product and concept developments by food industry competitors  the ability of the company and its franchisees to open new restaurants and operate new and existing restaurants profitably  increases in food  labor  utilities  fuel  employee benefits  insurance and similar costs  the ability to obtain ingredients from alternative suppliers if needed  health or disease related disruptions or consumer concerns about the commodity supply  economic and political and health conditions in the countries in which the company or its franchisees operate  the selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations  negotiation of suitable lease or financing terms  constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants  higher than anticipated construction costs  the hiring  training and retention of management and other personnel  changes in consumer taste  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants  federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime  and labor shortages in various markets resulting in higher required wage rates 
these factors might be especially harmful to the financial viability of franchises in under penetrated or emerging markets  leading to greater unit closings than anticipated 
our international operations are subject to additional factors  including currency regulations and fluctuations  differing cultures and consumer preferences  diverse government regulations and structures  ability to source high quality ingredients and other commodities in a cost effective manner  and differing interpretation of the obligations established in franchise agreements with international franchisees

in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provides for a fixed rate of  as compared to libor  on million of floating rate debt from march to march  reducing to a notional value of million from march to march  and reducing to a notional value of million in march with an expiration date of march the effective interest rate on the line of credit  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was as of december  an increase in the present interest rate of basis points on the line of credit debt balance outstanding as of december   as mitigated by the interest rate swap based on present interest rates  would have no impact on interest expense since the debt balance is less than the million notional amount 
the annual impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on the debt associated with vies would be  substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations do not have a significant impact on our operating results 
cheese costs  historically representing to of our total food cost  are subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  availability  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
as previously discussed in results of operations and critical accounting policies and estimates  we have a purchasing arrangement with a third party entity  bibp  formed at the direction of our franchise advisory council for the sole purpose of reducing cheese price volatility to domestic system wide restaurants 
under this arrangement  domestic company owned and franchised restaurants are able to purchase cheese at a fixed price per pound throughout a given quarter  based in part on historical average cheese prices 
gains and losses incurred by bibp are used as a factor in determining adjustments to the selling price to restaurants over time 
accordingly  for any given quarter  the price paid by the domestic company owned and franchised restaurants may be less than or greater than the prevailing average market price 
as a result of the adoption of fin  papa john s began consolidating the operating results of bibp in consolidation accounting requires the portion of bibp operating income loss related to domestic company owned restaurants to be reflected as a reduction increase in the domestic company owned restaurant expenses cost of sales line item  thus reflecting the actual market price of cheese had the purchasing arrangement not existed 
the consolidation of bibp had a significant impact on our operating results in and is expected to have a significant impact on future operating results depending on the prevailing spot block market price of cheese as compared to the price charged to domestic restaurants 
over time  we expect bibp to achieve break even financial results 
the following table presents the actual average block price for cheese and the bibp block price by quarter for  and actual block price bibp block price quarter quarter quarter quarter full year the following table presents the impact by quarter on our pre tax income due to consolidating bibp 
additionally  based on the chicago mercantile exchange milk futures market prices as of march   and the actual first and second quarter and projected third and fourth quarter cheese costs to restaurants as determined by the bibp pricing formula  the consolidation of bibp is projected to increase decrease our pre tax income as follows in in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter full year the projections above are based upon current futures market prices 
historically  actual results have differed significantly from previous projections using the futures market prices 
over the long term  we expect to purchase cheese at a price approximating the actual average market price and therefore we do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices
