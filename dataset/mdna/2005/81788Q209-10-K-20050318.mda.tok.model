item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
hewlett packard company in january  we entered into a subcontract agreement with hewlett packard company in connection with a wireless gateway project at sprint pcs  hewlett packard s customer 
under this agreement  we licensed our x treme mobility gateway product to hewlett packard for re licensing the software to sprint pcs 
we also agreed  as subcontractor for hewlett packard  to develop custom software for sprint and to perform related services in connection with the software 
these services include the integration of the software at sprint pcs and ongoing  consultancy  training and maintenance and support services in connection with the software 
all of these services are performed as a subcontractor to hewlett packard 
we receive fees under our subcontract agreement with hewlett packard through license fees for the use of our software 
the software that we have licensed to hewlett packard for re licensing to sprint pcs is installed in sprint pcs s data network and is used by sprint pcs to offer data services to its customers 
for example  the software allows customers to access the internet from their mobile devices 
prior to october  we were entitled to receive a license fee from hewlett packard for each new sprint pcs customer that used our software 
the obligation for hewlett packard to pay us license fees in respect of a new sprint pcs customer was triggered when the sprint pcs customer used its mobile device to access sprint pcs s data services 
in october  we amended the agreement with hewlett packard 
the amended agreement expires in october under the amended agreement  hewlett packard pays us fixed license fees 
these fixed license fees are paid on a quarterly basis until march and on a monthly basis after march  for sprint pcs s unlimited use of the software 
the fixed license fees continue until december  at which time hewlett packard will have a fully paid  unlimited use license to re license the software to sprint pcs 
if hewlett packard ceases to pay us the quarterly monthly fixed fees  the license converts to a license for a fixed number of users based on the number of users at the end of the quarter or month in respect of which the last payment was received 
if  at any time and for any reason  sprint pcs decides to no longer use our software for additional customers  hewlett packard will cease paying the quarterly monthly fixed fees and we will not receive any further license fees under the agreement 
this would result in a substantial reduction of our revenues 
professional services fees 
we derive revenue from hewlett packard under the agreement for the performance of integration  consultancy and training services 
these services are performed on a fixed price basis 
maintenance and support fees 
we provide maintenance and support services in connection with our software for a fee that is based on a fixed percentage of the cumulative value of the license fees paid by hewlett packard 
research and development as of march   our research and development department consisted of employees and full time equivalents 
these employees are responsible for assessing new technologies  scheduling new releases  product architecture  security  performance engineering  product requirements  quality assurance and product support 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing activities are primarily directed at mobile network operators 
a number of departments within a customer s organization are typically involved in purchase decisions with respect to our products  including senior management  network engineering personnel  and the procurement and marketing departments 
we maintain sales offices in the united states  the united kingdom and hong kong  and we have individual sales representatives in several other countries 
our sales activities are supported by marketing efforts  including marketing communications  product management  market research and strategic alliances 
as of march   our sales and marketing group consisted of employees and full time equivalents 
our sales employees generally receive incentive compensation based on individual sales volume in addition to their base salaries 
in addition to offering our x treme mobility suite of products directly to mobile network operators  to expand our distribution capability we supplement our direct sales and marketing efforts by utilizing relationships with resellers such as hardware and other software solutions providers and independent sales agents and regional systems integrators 
these relationships are important to us because  in some cases  these distribution partners have an established local presence in markets in which we do not  are familiar with local trade customs in those markets and may be existing suppliers to end customers in those markets and often are the system integrator in the sale  installation and ongoing support of our software product 
these relationships are customary in the software industry 
moreover  in some cases  rather than dealing directly with suppliers like the company  large mobile network operators sometimes prefer to deal with larger and  in some cases  more locally well known companies 
strategic relationships we have established and continue to develop relationships with mobile network operators  wireless network software and equipment suppliers and content and technology providers throughout the world to facilitate the sale and adoption of our products and services 
we anticipate that some of these relationships will lead to formal arrangements in which strategic partners will agree to incorporate  resell and or implement our solutions 
through strategic relationships  we seek to gain worldwide access and positioning  technological leadership  and an early awareness of emerging mobile technologies 
these relationships generally do not give rise to material rights and obligations for us outside of specific agreements with respect to the sale of our products 
competition the market for our products and services is becoming increasingly competitive 
the widespread adoption of open standards may make it easier for new market entrants and existing competitors to introduce products that compete against ours 
we believe that we will compete primarily on the basis of the quality  functionality and ease of integration of our products  as well as on the basis of price 
because we are smaller than most of our competitors  we believe that we can be more attentive to the needs of our customers than some of our competitors 
as a provider of next generation ip based network and data services  we assess potential competitors based primarily on their product functionality and range of services  the security and scalability of their product architecture  their customer base and geographic focus and their capitalization and other resources 
our principal current and potential competitors include mobile access gateway vendors and messaging solution providers companies in this category include openwave systems  logicacmg  comverse  materna  nokia and ericsson 
some of these companies can be both partners and competitors with respect to our software products 
alerts focused businesses companies that focus in the development and delivery of alerts and message based technology include xiam  first hop  materna  and infospace 
these companies are competitive with our xap software product 
network equipment and device manufacturers ericsson  nokia  motorola and other large wireless technology vendors are both potential competitors and potential partners for our software products 
particularly with respect to several of our competitors for the mobile access gateway product and competitors who are equipment and device manufacturers  our competition have longer operating histories  large customer bases  substantial financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  and strong brand recognition in each of the above mentioned categories 
these competitors may be able to compete more effectively than us based on price or by bundling other goods and services with their product offering that we cannot 
however  we believe that we will compete primarily with these competitors on the basis of the quality  warranty  functionality and ease of integration of our products  as well as on the basis of price 
in addition  particularly with respect to our alerts products  we face competition from small private companies that may have even lower cost structures and may be able to take more financial risk with respect to customer pricing than we are willing to consider 
we believe that we will compete with these competitors on the basis of the quality  warranty  functionality and ease of integration of our products  as well as on the basis of price 
our competitors have established  and may establish in the future  strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
through these relationships or independently  current and potential competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products to both our existing customers and our potential customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors for new customers and for ongoing business from our current customers 
failure by us to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with established or new competitors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
intellectual property we protect our proprietary technology through a combination of contractual confidentiality provisions  trade secrets  and patent  copyright and trademark laws 
we have received registered trademarks in australia  canada the united kingdom  mexico and the european community 
in addition  we have applied for registration of some of our trademarks in the united states 
we have also applied for patents relating to our mobile commerce technology  the x treme mobility suite of products and our multi channel framework technology 
we have applied for patent protection in canada  the united states  japan and through the patent cooperation treaty  which is an international patent application designating multiple countries 
to date  we have received thirteen patents with respect to the technologies relating to our x treme mobility suite of products 
our performance depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products  including our ability to enforce our existing patent rights 
our xmg and xma products are built using the key concepts in our patents of processing multiple tasks simultaneously  as opposed to sequentially  which is a cornerstone of our ability to process information faster than competitive products 
our inability to protect these rights could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
however  we do not believe that our business will be materially affected if we do not receive the patents and trademarks for which we have applied and not yet received 
there can be no assurance that the confidentiality provisions in our contracts will be adequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our copyrights  pending and issued patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that independent third parties will not develop competing technologies  or reverse engineer our trade secrets  software or other technology 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of canada and the united states 
therefore  the measures taken by us may not adequately protect our proprietary rights 
we use certain third party software that may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or prices or at all in the future 
moreover  some of our third party license agreements are non exclusive and  therefore  our competitors may have access to some of the same technology 
to date  no claims have been made that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  but third parties could claim infringement by us with respect to our existing or future products 
any claim of this kind  whether or not it has merit  could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention  cause delays in product installation  or cause us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms that may not be acceptable to us 
employees as of march   we had employees and full time equivalents worldwide 
risk factors risk factors related to our business we have a history of losses and we expect losses in the future 
we have not been profitable since our inception 
any shortfall in our revenues relative to our expectations could cause a significant increase to our net losses 
we cannot predict if we will ever achieve profitability and  if we do  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability 
our future revenues and operating results are dependent to a large extent upon uncertain general economic conditions 
our future revenues and operating results are dependent to a large extent upon general economic conditions  conditions in the wireless market and within that market  our primary target market of mobile network operators 
if general economic conditions are adverse  if the economies in which our target customers are located suffer from a recession  if demand for our solutions does not expand  or if war or terrorism impacts the us  europe  asia or our other target markets  our ability to increase our customer base may be limited  and our revenue may decrease further 
we may experience an increase in price pressure in the future  and if we are not successful in reducing our costs  we may experience a decrease in gross margins 
we believe that a variety of factors in the current market contribute to the risk that prices and therefore our gross margins will decrease in future fiscal quarters 
for example  as our customers continue to assess their business strategies and their budgets for wireless spending  we may feel additional pressure to lower our prices 
in addition  consolidation among mobile network operators  as well as heightened competition  could create increased pricing pressure in the marketplace 
because we have a limited operating history  it may be difficult for you to evaluate our business and its future prospects 
because we are in an early stage of development  our prospects are difficult to predict and may change rapidly 
we may encounter difficulties as a young company in a new and rapidly evolving market  including as a result of our dependence on a small number of products with only limited market acceptance 
our business strategy may not be successful  and we may not successfully address these risks 
we have a lengthy and complex sales cycle for several of our products  which could cause the delay or loss of revenue and increase our expenses 
our sales efforts target mobile network operators worldwide  which require us to expend significant resources educating prospective customers and partners about the uses and benefits of our products 
because the purchase of our products is a significant decision for these prospective customers  they may take a long time to evaluate them 
our sales cycle has typically ranged from four to six months  but can be longer due to significant delays over which we have little or no control 
as a result of the long sales cycle  it may take us a substantial amount of time to generate revenue from our sales efforts 
we are dependant upon the growth of penetration of our products in the mobile network operator marketplace 
we have made mobile network operators the main focus of our activities 
our future success depends on our ability to increase revenues from sales of our software and services directly and indirectly to mobile network operators 
we may not be able to attract a large number of these customers 
currently  only a limited number of mobile network operators and other customers have implemented and deployed services based on our products 
mobile network operators may not widely deploy or successfully sell services based on our software and services  and subscribers to these services may not seek to use them 
any developments of this kind could limit our ability to sell our solutions to companies in this industry 
in addition  our success is dependent upon increased adoption by end users of the services that are based on our software and services 
mobile network operators and their competitors for example  other communications providers may successfully deploy and market services that compete with the services that are based on our technology 
if subscribers of our mobile network operator customers do not increase their use of services that are based on our software and services  our operating results will be harmed 
we face risks as a result of our operations in international markets 
we expect that sales in international markets will be a major factor in our growth  particularly since the use of wireless networks and wireless devices have generally proceeded more rapidly outside north america 
risks inherent in conducting business internationally include reliance on local distribution partners  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements applicable to our business  customer concentration  the pace of adoption of our technology  export restrictions on encryption and other technologies  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable resulting in longer collection periods  lower pricing of license and professional service fees  and differences in foreign laws and regulations  including foreign tax  intellectual property  labor and contract law 
any of these factors could harm our international operations and  consequently  our operating results and growth 
our products have achieved limited market acceptance to date  and if they fail to achieve broader market acceptance  our business will not grow 
our products are among a number of competing products that are currently available in a new and rapidly evolving market 
other companies may introduce other software products that will compete with ours 
customers may not prefer our products to competing technologies 
some potential customers may be reluctant to work with us due to our fluctuating stock price  or due to our financial condition 
if customers do not accept our products as the preferred solution  we may not attract new customers and our business will not grow 
our future revenue depends on consumers using the services that are based on our products  and if our customers do not successfully market these services  our revenue will not grow 
revenue under most of our license agreements depends on the number of monthly subscribers to the services that are based on our products or the amount of use of those services 
as a result  our revenue growth will be limited if the number of subscribers or use of the services that are based on our software does not increase 
to stimulate consumer adoption of these services  our customers must implement our products quickly 
however  our customers may delay implementation because of factors that are not within our control  including budgetary constraints  limited resources committed to the implementation process and limited internal technical support 
consumer adoption of these services also requires our customers to market these services 
however  our customers currently have no obligation to launch a marketing campaign of any kind  may choose not to do so  or may not do so effectively 
some of our customers have only provided these services on a test basis to a limited number of consumers 
some of our customers may choose not to expand their use of these services if they do not perceive a sufficiently high rate of adoption among their consumers 
as a result  we cannot ensure that a large number of consumers will use these services in the future 
we need to retain our customers and add new customers or our revenue may be substantially reduced and our products may not achieve market acceptance 
we have agreements with existing customers in which they either pay us based on the usage of the services that are based on our products or have an option to purchase additional software licenses and or renew their current relationship with us 
if any of our customers discontinue their use of our software in connection with the services that they offer or discontinue their relationship with us for any reason  do not renew their agreements or seek to reduce or renegotiate their purchase and payment obligations  our revenue may be substantially reduced 
consolidation of companies in the telecommunications industry may reduce the number of potential new customers that would be available to us 
if our sales efforts to these potential customers are not successful  our products may not achieve market acceptance and our revenue will not grow 
further decreases in adoption will have a material impact on our revenues 
we have relied on sales to a limited number of customers  and if we fail to retain these customers or to add new customers  our revenue may be substantially reduced and our products may not achieve market acceptance 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of our solutions to a limited number of customers 
in the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was derived from hewlett packard in connection with the re licensing by it of our software to sprint pcs 
most of our revenue from both hewlett packard in connection with the deployment of our software at sprint pcs and our other customers depends on the end customer s continued or increased use of our products 
if the end customers of our products discontinue  materially reduce or  in some cases  do not increase their use of our products our revenues will decline 
in addition  if the end customers of our products obtain one or more additional suppliers of competing software and services  our revenues will decline 
if sprint pcs discontinues or does not increase its use of our software  or if sprint pcs terminates its existing arrangement with hewlett packard under which we provide our software and services  we may lose a substantial portion of our revenues 
see part i  item  business customers and part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we believe that we may continue to rely upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future  and any failure by us to capture or retain a significant share of these customers could materially harm our business 
in addition  if our customer base consolidates  we will have increased dependence on a few customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and contractual terms in general 
if we do not respond adequately to evolving technology standards  sales of our products may decline 
our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging technologies  including technologies related to communications and the internet generally 
the wireless data market is a rapidly evolving market and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed  or are in the process of introducing or developing  products that facilitate the delivery of data services through wireless devices 
in addition  our competitors may develop alternative products that gain broader market acceptance than ours 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is difficult to estimate 
we need to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards  changing customer requirements and competitive technologies that may render our products obsolete 
these research and development efforts may require us to expend significant capital and other resources 
in addition  as a result of the complexities inherent in our products  major enhancements or improvements will require long development and testing periods 
if we fail to develop products and services in a timely fashion  or if we do not enhance our products to meet evolving customer needs and industry standards  including security technology  we may not remain competitive or sell our solution 
any disruption of the services supported by our products due to accidental or intentional security breaches may damage our reputation  reduce our revenue  expose us to costly litigation or require capital investments in alternative security technology 
despite our efforts to maximize the security of our platform  we may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt transactions between our customers and the consumers of their services 
specifically  computer viruses  break ins and other disruptions could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to accept and confirm the receipt of information or instructions regarding transactions 
any of these events could substantially damage our reputation 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide key components of the security and authentication necessary to achieve secure transmission of confidential information 
we cannot necessarily ensure that this technology  future advances in this technology or other developments will be able to prevent security breaches 
as a result  we may need to develop or license other technology in the future to address these security concerns 
if a third party were able to steal a user s proprietary information  we could be subject to claims  litigation or other potential liabilities that could cause our expenses to increase substantially 
in addition to purposeful security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to costly litigation or a significant loss of revenue 
although our customer agreements contain provisions which limit our liability relating to security to some extent  our customers or their consumers may seek to hold us liable for any losses suffered as a result of unauthorized access to their communications 
any litigation of this kind  regardless of its outcome  could be extremely costly and could significantly divert the attention of our management 
we may not have adequate insurance or resources to cover these losses 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency exchange losses 
our operations outside the us may be conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  including the value of the canadian dollar and the euro  could cause currency exchange losses  as our offices outside of the united states generate non us dollar denominated expenses 
we have not taken significant steps to hedge against these losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results 
although foreign currency losses were not material in  no assurance can be given as to what they may be in future periods 
we may limit investments in other companies and new technologies 
because of the continuing volatility in the financial markets  as well as other factors  we may limit equity investments in other companies and the purchase of new technologies during the next few fiscal quarters  and possibly longer 
as a result  we may not take advantage of investment opportunities that could provide us significant financial benefits  or that could provide us with the opportunity to build relationships with other companies in our industry and target markets 
we may have difficulties collecting receivables 
a significant portion of our receivables is derived from customers in foreign countries 
due to varying economic conditions and business practices in these countries  our collections cycle from these customers may be longer than with our north american customers 
in the event of adverse economic conditions  there will be a greater risk that our customers will have difficulties in paying us in accordance with the terms of their contracts  and our risk of bad debt may increase substantially 
our gross margins may decrease 
we believe that certain factors in the current market may contribute to the risk that our gross margins will decrease in future fiscal quarters 
we may have to lower our prices in order to accommodate our customers 
in addition  many of our customers are reluctant to make a commitment to pay large upfront license fees or to guarantee purchases of a minimum number of licenses or licensed capacity  which could also cause our revenues to decrease 
some mobile network operators are also unwilling to pay for installations and customizations to our products  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we will need to recruit  train and retain key management and other qualified personnel to successfully grow our business 
our ability to execute our business successfully depends in large part upon our ability to have a sufficient number of qualified employees to achieve our goals 
there are only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in many key management and non management positions  and it is difficult to retain and hire these persons 
if we are unable to do so  our business could be negatively affected 
the morale of our current employees may have been adversely affected by previous workforce reductions  potentially impacting their performance or their willingness to remain with us 
our ability to attract potential new employees in the future may suffer if our reputation suffers as a result of these staffing reductions or otherwise 
our software may contain defects or errors that could damage our reputation 
the software that we develop is complex and must satisfy the stringent technical requirements of our customers 
we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing industry in which we operate 
software products that are as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
in addition  our software may not properly operate when integrated with the systems of some customers or when used to deliver services to a large number of a customer s subscribers 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers to identify and correct bugs  errors in our product may be found in the future 
our software may not be free from errors or defects even after it has been tested  which could result in the rejection of our products and damage to our reputation  as well as lost revenue  diverted development resources and increased support costs 
we may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant costs to us 
as noted in item legal proceedings  we and certain of our former officers and directors were named as defendants in a series of purported class actions relating to our initial public offering 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive  and distracting from the conduct of our business  and the outcome of litigation may be difficult to predict 
the adverse resolution of any of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our products contain encryption technology whose export is restricted by law  which may slow our growth or result in significant costs 
the us  canadian and other foreign governments generally limit the export of encryption technology  which our products incorporate 
a variety of cryptographic products generally require export approvals from certain government agencies in the case of exports from certain countries  although there are currently no restrictions on exports of these products from canada into the us if any export approval that we receive is revoked or modified  if our software is unlawfully exported or if the us  canadian or other relevant government adopts new legislation or regulations restricting export of software and encryption technology  we may not be able to distribute our products to potential customers  which will cause a decline in sales 
we may need to incur significant costs and divert resources in order to develop replacement technologies or may need to adopt inferior substitute technologies to satisfy these export restrictions 
these replacement or substitute technologies may not be the preferred security technologies of our customers  in which case our business may not grow 
in addition  we may suffer similar consequences if the laws of any other country limit the ability of third parties to sell encryption technologies to us 
if we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations  we may be forced to discontinue product development  reduce our sales and marketing efforts or forego attractive business opportunities 
in order to help ensure that we would have sufficient capital to take advantage of our core business opportunities  we have taken significant actions to reduce our operating expenses 
however  most of our operating expenses  such as employee compensation and lease payments for facilities and equipment  are relatively stable  and these expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenues 
as a result  any sustained shortfall in our revenues relative to our expectations would negatively impact our operating results 
accordingly  if the cost cutting actions that we have taken are insufficient  we may not have sufficient capital to fund our operations  and additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any of these outcomes could adversely impact our ability to respond to competitive pressures or could prevent us from conducting all or a portion of our planned operations 
we may need to undertake additional measures to reduce our operating expenses in the future 
we expect that the cash we receive through our operations and our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we also may require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of existing shareholders will be reduced 
if we incur debt  the debt will rank senior to our common shares  we will incur debt service costs and we will likely have to enter into agreements that will restrict our operations in some respects and our ability to declare dividends to the holders of our common shares 
the terms of the notes that we have issued to our affiliate  austin ventures  may also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing 
for example  these notes limit our ability to issue equity securities at prices that are less than specified amounts  and austin venture has obtained a security interest as to our assets 
risk factors related to our industry our business will not grow if the use of wireless data services does not continue to grow 
the markets for wireless data services and related products are still emerging and continued growth in demand for  and acceptance of  these services remains uncertain 
our products depend on the acceptance of wireless data services and internet enabled devices in the mobile network operator market 
current barriers to market acceptance of these services include cost  reliability  platform and distribution channel constraints  consumer privacy concerns  functionality and ease of use 
mobile individuals currently use many competing products  such as portable computers  to remotely access the internet 
these products generally are designed for the visual presentation of data  while  until recently  wireless devices historically have been limited in this regard 
we cannot be certain that these barriers will be overcome 
since the market for our products is new and evolving  it is difficult to predict the size of this market or its future growth rate  if any 
our future financial performance will depend in large part upon the continued demand for data services through wireless devices 
we cannot ensure that a sufficient volume of subscribers will demand these services 
if the market for these wireless online services grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our revenue may not grow 
our business depends on continued investment and improvement in communication networks 
some of our customers and other mobile network operators have made substantial investments in generation and rd generation networks 
these networks are designed to support more complex applications  and to provide consumers with a more robust user experience 
if network operators delay their deployments of these networks  or do not roll them out successfully  there could be reduced demand for our products and services 
in addition  if communication service providers fail to continue to make investments in their networks or at a slower pace in the future  there may be less demand for our products and services 
we face competition from existing and new competitors and from new products  which could cause us to lose market share and cause our revenue to decline 
the widespread adoption of open industry standards may make it easier for new market entrants and existing competitors to introduce products that compete with ours 
in addition  competitors may develop or market products and services that are superior or more cost effective than ours  which could decrease demand for our products and cause our revenue to decline 
currently  our competitors include mobile access gateway vendors and messaging solution providers  alerts focused businesses  and network equipment and device manufacturers 
we may also face competition in the future from established companies that have not previously entered the market for wireless data infrastructure software and services 
barriers to entry in the software market are relatively low and it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
see competition above 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than us 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than us in terms of revenue  marketing and research and development expenditures and numbers of employees in their sales  services and support organizations 
the competitors we face on our x treme mobility suite xms sales opportunities include nokia  ericsson  comverse  alcatel and openwave 
our success is dependent on our ability to win our share of these opportunities against these larger competitors and to retain our customers 
many of these competitors are able to bundle other products including handsets and or network equipment into sales of competitive products  which they might argue reduces risk to their customers 
we do not believe that we can offer similar product bundles  which could prevent us from competing with these competitors  offering similar pricing  retaining key customers or acquiring new customers 
changes in government regulations may result in increased expenses  taxes or licensing fees that could decrease the demand for our product and negatively impact our results 
we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws and regulations directly applicable to access to  or commerce on  the internet and wireless networks 
however  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  provincial  local and foreign governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the internet and wireless networks  including but not limited to  online content  user privacy  taxation  access charges and liability for third party activities 
additionally  it is uncertain how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright  trade secrets  libel and personal privacy will be applied to the internet and wireless networks 
the adoption of new laws or the broader application of existing laws may expose us to significant liabilities and additional operational requirements and may decrease the growth in the use of the internet and wireless networks  which could  in turn  both decrease the demand for our products and increase the cost of doing business 
risks relating to intellectual property we rely on third party software  technology and content  the loss of which could force us to use inferior substitute technology or to cease offering our products 
we must now  and may in the future  license or otherwise obtain access to the intellectual property of third parties 
in addition  we use  and will use in the future  some third party software that may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
for example  we could lose our ability to use this software if the rights of our suppliers to license it were challenged by individuals or companies that asserted ownership of these rights 
the loss of  or inability to maintain or obtain  any required intellectual property could require us to use substitute technology  which could be more expensive or of lower quality or performance  or force us to cease offering our products 
moreover  some of our license agreements from third parties are non exclusive and  as a result  our competitors may have access to some of the technologies used by us 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  we may lose our competitive advantage 
we depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect our proprietary technology  including software  documentation and other written materials under patent  trade secret and copyright laws  as well as confidentiality provisions in contracts with our customers  suppliers  contractors and employees  all of which afford limited protection 
we cannot ensure that these steps will be adequate  that we will be able to secure the desired patent or trademark registrations for our patent applications in canada  the us or other countries  or that third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts or infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  patents or pending patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
similarly  we cannot ensure that our employees will comply with the confidentiality agreements that they have entered into with us  and misappropriate our technology for the benefit of a third party 
if a third party or any employee breaches the confidentiality provisions in our contracts or misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property  we may not have adequate remedies 
in addition  third parties may independently discover or invent competing technologies that are not covered by our patents or reverse engineer our trade secrets  software or other technology 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us and canada 
therefore  the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
third parties may claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property  which could result in significant expenses for litigation or for developing or licensing new technology 
although we are not currently aware of any claims asserted by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  in the future  third parties may assert claims of this kind 
we cannot predict whether third parties will assert these types of claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us  or whether those claims will harm our business 
if we are forced to defend against these types of claims  whether they are with or without any merit or whether they are resolved in favor of or against us  or our licensors  we may face costly litigation and diversion of management s attention and resources 
as a result of these disputes  we may have to develop costly non infringing technology  or enter into licensing agreements 
these agreements  if necessary  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  which could prevent us from selling our products  increase our expenses or make our products less attractive to customers 
risks relating to the ownership and trading of our common shares the rights that have been and may in the future be granted to our shareholders may allow our board and management to deter a potential acquisition of our company 
our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan  or poison pill  which our shareholders will be asked to renew and continue at our shareholder meeting scheduled to take place on april  under the plan  rights to purchase common shares have been issued to holders of common shares 
these rights become exercisable under certain circumstances in which someone acquires or more of our outstanding shares 
as part of the million financing transactions in may and june between austin ventures and us  our board of directors agreed to waive the terms and provisions of the plan to permit the acquisition by austin ventures or its affiliates of up to forty nine percent of our outstanding common shares 
as a result of the plan  anyone wishing to take over the company may be forced under certain circumstances to negotiate a transaction with our board and management or comply with certain bid criteria in order not to trigger the exercise of rights 
the need to negotiate with the board or management or to comply with certain bid criteria could add complexity to a proposed takeover 
for example  a proposed hostile bidder might have to bring court or regulatory proceedings to have the shareholder rights plan cease traded 
this could prolong the take over process and  arguably  deter a potential bidder 
our ability to issue preferred shares could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  to the detriment of holders of common shares 
our ability to issue preferred shares could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  to the detriment of holders of common shares 
provisions in our articles of incorporation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our articles authorize our board to issue  at its discretion  an unlimited number of preferred shares 
without shareholder approval  but subject to regulatory approval in certain circumstances  the board has the authority to attach special rights  including voting or dividend rights  to the preferred shares 
preferred shareholders who possess these rights could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
your tax liability may increase if we are treated as a passive foreign investment company 
if at any time we qualify as a passive foreign investment company under us tax laws  us holders as defined below in this report may be subject to adverse tax consequences 
we could be a passive foreign investment company if or more of our gross income in any year is considered passive income for us tax purposes 
for this purpose  passive income generally includes interest  dividends  some types of rents and royalties  and gains from the sale of assets that produce these types of income 
in addition  we could be classified  as a passive foreign investment company if the average percentage of our assets during any year that produced passive income or that were held to produce passive income  is at least 
if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company  and if us holders sell any of their common shares or receive some types of distributions from us  they may have to pay taxes that are higher than if we were not considered a passive foreign investment company 
it is impossible to predict how much shareholders taxes would increase  if at all 
there is a substantial risk that we were a passive foreign investment company for the year to determine whether we are a passive foreign investment company  our revenue and expenses and the value of our assets would need to be examined each year 
the manner in which the tests apply to our business is not certain 
the tests are complex and require  among other things  that we determine how much of our income from our license agreements each year will be passive income 
in addition  we are required to determine each year whether the value of our assets that produce passive income or are held to produce passive income will constitute at least of our total assets 
as a result of the size of our cash position  based on the published position of the internal revenue service irs that for this purpose  cash is considered to be an asset which produces passive income  even if the cash is held as working capital  we would be considered a passive foreign investment company for the year ended december  the published position of the irs that cash held as working capital is a passive asset has not been promulgated in regulations  and no other official guidance has been issued on the question 
therefore  it is unclear that we were a passive foreign investment company for and shareholders should consult their own advisors regarding our status as a passive foreign investment company 
even if it were determined that we were not a passive foreign investment company for  no assurances can be given that we will not be a passive foreign investment company in future years 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters passive foreign investment company considerations 
each holder of our common shares is urged to consult  his  her or its own tax advisor to discuss the potential consequences to such investor if at any time we qualify as a passive foreign investment company 
future sales of common shares by our existing shareholders could cause our share price to fall 
the volume of trading in our common shares on the toronto stock exchange and the nasdaq smallcap market has not been substantial 
as a result  even small dispositions of our common shares in the public market could cause the market price of the common shares to fall 
the perception among investors that these sales will occur could also produce this effect 
we have granted options to purchase our common shares in accordance with our stock incentive plan subject to shareholder approval  stock option plan and previous stock option plans 
the exercise of options and the subsequent sale of shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
in addition  our affiliate  austin ventures  owns approximately of our common shares  and if austin ventures exercises its right to convert the convertible notes held by it plus the interest due at march  into common shares  it will own approximately of our outstanding common shares  on a fully diluted basis 
austin ventures has the right to require us to register these shares with the sec for resale 
as a result  sales of our common shares by austin ventures could also adversely affect their market price 
a limited number of shareholders own a significant portion of our common shares  and may act  or prevent certain types of corporate actions  to the detriment of other shareholders 
our significant shareholders and members of our management team  including austin ventures  which is affiliated with a member of our board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our common shares as of march  austin ventures may receive additional common shares upon conversion of the notes that it owns please see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  
accordingly  these shareholders may  if they act together  exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of a majority of the directors and the determination of significant corporate actions 
this concentration could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that could be otherwise beneficial to our shareholders

item legal proceedings 
the company has been named in several class actions filed in federal court in the southern district of new york between approximately june  and june  collectively the ipo allocation litigation 
the ipo allocation litigation was filed on behalf of purported classes of plaintiffs who acquired the company s common shares during certain periods 
these lawsuits have since been consolidated into a single action and an amended complaint was filed on or about april  similar actions have or since been filed against over other issuers that have had initial public offerings since and all are included in a single coordinated proceeding in the southern district of new york 
the amended complaint in the ipo allocation litigation names as defendants  in addition to the company  some former directors and officers of the company the individual defendants and certain underwriters of the company s initial public offering of securities the underwriter defendants 
in general  the amended complaint alleges that the underwriter defendants allocated shares of the company s offering of equity securities to certain of their customers  in exchange for which these customers agreed to pay the underwriter defendants extra commissions on transactions in other securities  and allocated shares of the company s initial public offering to certain of the underwriter defendants customers  in exchange for which the customers agreed to purchase additional common shares of the company in the after market at certain pre determined prices 
the amended complaint also alleges that the company and the individual defendants failed to disclose these facts and that the company and the individual defendants were aware of  or disregarded  the underwriter defendants conduct 
in october  the individual defendants were dismissed from the ipo allocation litigation without prejudice 
in july  a committee of the company s board of directors conditionally approved a proposed partial settlement with the plaintiffs in this matter 
the settlement would provide  among other things  a release of the company and of the individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the action to be wrongful in the amended complaint 
the company would agree to undertake other responsibilities under the partial settlement  including agreeing to assign away  not assert  or release certain potential claims the company may have against its underwriters 
any direct financial impact of the proposed settlement is expected to be borne by the company s insurers 
in june  an agreement of settlement was submitted to the court for preliminary approval 
the court granted the preliminary approval motion on february   subject to certain modifications 
the parties are directed to report back to the court regarding the modifications 
if the parties are able to agree upon the required modifications  and those modifications are acceptable to the court  notice will be given to all class members of the settlement  a fairness hearing will be held and if the court determines that the settlement is fair to the class members  the settlement will be approved 
there can be no assurance that this proposed settlement would be approved and implemented in its current form  or at all 
if the proposed settlement is not consummated  the company intends to continue to vigorously defend itself and the individual defendants against these claims 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  and because the ipo litigation is at a preliminary stage  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome ipo allocation litigation

material united states federal and canadian income tax consequences general the following discussion of material us federal income tax consequences and canadian federal income tax consequences of ownership of solutions common shares is included for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete description of all potential tax consequences 
the discussion does not address any potential tax effects to non us holders as defined below nor does the discussion address all potential tax effects that may be relevant to us holders subject to special us federal income or canadian tax treatment  including persons who own actually or constructively or more of either the total voting power or total value of all capital stock of solutions  persons subject to the alternative minimum tax  persons who are or have been residents of canada or engaged in a trade or business in canada through a permanent establishment  persons who hold their shares as part of a hedge  straddle or conversion transaction  persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar  insurance companies  financial institutions  dealers in securities  traders that mark to market  tax exempt organizations  and retirement plans 
the following discussion does not address the effect of applicable state  provincial  local or foreign other than canadian tax laws 
us holder means a holder of shares of solutions who is i a citizen or resident of the us  ii a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created in or organized under the laws of the us or any political subdivision of the us  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax regardless of its source or iv in general  a trust if a us court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of that trust  and one or more us persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of that trust 
a non us holder means a holder of shares who is not a non us holder 
material us federal income tax consequences this summary of material us federal income tax consequences is based on the internal revenue code  treasury regulations  administrative rulings and practice and judicial precedent  each as in effect at the date of this annual report  all of which are subject to change 
any such change  which may or may not be retroactive  could alter the tax consequences discussed herein 
no rulings have been or are expected to be sought from the internal revenue service concerning the tax consequences of holding common shares of solutions  and this tax discussion as to the material us federal income tax consequences will not be binding on the internal revenue service or any court 
this discussion relies on assumptions  including assumptions regarding the absence of changes in existing facts 
taxation of dividends subject to the discussion below under passive foreign investment company considerations  for us federal income tax purposes  the us dollar value of any distribution made out of solutions current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for federal tax income purposes will be included in gross income by a us holder and will be treated as foreign source dividend income except that if more than of solutions stock is owned by us persons  a portion of any dividends may be treated as us source for purposes of calculating such holder s us foreign tax credit 
the us dollar value of any distribution received in canadian dollars will be based on the spot exchange rate for the date of receipt 
if dividends paid by solutions were to exceed solutions current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes  any excess would be treated as a non taxable return of capital to the extent of the us holder s adjusted basis in the common shares of solutions  and thereafter as a capital gain 
under recently enacted us federal income tax legislation  a non corporate us holder s qualified dividend income currently is subject to tax at reduced rates not exceeding 
for this purpose  qualified dividend income generally includes dividends paid by a foreign corporation if either a the stock of that corporation with respect to which the dividends are paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the us  or b that corporation is eligible for benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the us which includes an information exchange program and is determined to be satisfactory by the us secretary of the treasury 
the internal revenue service has determined that the canada us tax convention is satisfactory for this purpose 
dividends paid by a foreign corporation will not qualify for the reduced rates  however  if such corporation is treated  for the tax year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding tax year  as a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes 
see the discussion under passive foreign investment company considerations below 
a us holder will be required to include in income the canadian withholding tax paid with respect to dividends and may claim a foreign tax credit or a deduction with respect to such tax  subject to applicable limitations 
taxation of gains upon the sale or disposition of a common share of solutions  you will recognize gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the us dollar value of the amount realized and your adjusted tax basis in the share 
subject to the discussion below under the heading passive foreign investment company considerations  such gain or loss will generally be treated as us source capital gain or loss 
if you are an individual  any such capital gain will generally be subject to us federal income tax at preferential rates if specified minimum holding periods are met 
passive foreign investment company considerations the rules governing passive foreign investment companies can have significant tax effects on us holders 
if we are a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for any taxable year in which a u 
s 
holder owns any of our common shares  the us federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of common shares may differ from those described above 
our treatment as a pfic could result in a reduction in the after tax return to the us holders of our common shares 
for us federal income tax purposes  we will be classified as a pfic for any taxable year in which either i or more of our gross income is passive income  or ii at least of the average value or in some cases  adjusted tax basis of all of our assets for the taxable year produce or are held for the production of passive income 
for this purpose  passive income generally includes interest  dividends  some types of rents and royalties  annuities and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets that produce these types of income 
there is a substantial risk that we were a pfic for the year to determine whether we are a pfic  our revenue and expenses and the value of our assets would need to be examined each year 
the manner in which the tests apply to our business is not certain 
the tests are complex and require  among other things  that we determine how much of our income from our license agreements each year will be passive income 
in addition  we are required to determine each year whether the value of our assets that produce passive income or are held to produce passive income will constitute at least of our total assets 
as a result of the size of our cash position  based on the published position of the irs that for this purpose  cash is considered to be an asset that produces passive income  even if the cash is held as working capital  we would be considered a pfic for the year ended december  the published position of the irs that cash held as working capital is a passive asset has not been promulgated in regulations  and no other official guidance has been issued on the question 
therefore  it is unclear that we were a pfic for and us holders should consult their own advisors regarding our pfic status 
even if it were determined that we were not a pfic for  no assurances can be given that we will not be a pfic in future years 
if we are a pfic for us federal income tax purposes  for any taxable year in which a us holder owns common shares  such us holder would be subject to certain us tax consequences  including special rules applicable to certain excess distributions  as defined in section of the code  and gain on the sale of common shares 
in general  the us holder must allocate the excess distribution or gain ratably to each day in such holder s holding period for the common shares 
the portion of the excess distribution or gain allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year in the holding period before we were a pfic would be taxed as ordinary income for the current year 
the portion of the excess distribution or gain allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the maximum ordinary income rate in effect for such taxable year and an interest charge would be imposed on the resulting tax liability determined as if that liability had been due with respect to that prior year 
the tax consequences referred to above will not apply if the us holder makes a timely election to treat us as a qualified electing fund  or qef  for the first taxable year in which the us holder owns common shares and in which we are a pfic  and certain other requirements are satisfied 
a shareholder making the qef election is required for each taxable year to include in income a pro rata share of the ordinary income and net capital gain of the qef  subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes  which deferral is subject to an interest charge 
the inclusion in income is required regardless of whether or not we actually distribute any dividends  and a us holder could therefore have a tax liability for our earnings or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash 
to make a qef election  us holders will need to have an annual information statement from us setting forth  among other things  our earnings and capital gains for the year 
because of the substantial risk that we are a pfic  we will supply the pfic annual information statement to any us holder who requests it  provided we are able to do so 
further information can be requested from investor relations  extension  or through our website at www 
com contactus ir 
asp 
the qef election is made on a shareholder by shareholder basis and can be revoked only with the consent of the irs 
in general  a us holder must make a qef election on or before the due date for filing its income tax return for the first year to which the qef election will apply 
in certain circumstances  however  us holders may make a retroactive election to be treated as a qef 
this retroactive election in some cases requires the filing of a protective statement with the holder s income tax return for the first year to which the qef election would apply 
in addition  qef elections may in certain circumstances be made for years after the first year in which we are a pfic  but adverse consequences may result from elections filed for such years 
us holders should consult with their own tax advisors concerning the advisability  requirements  procedures and timing for making a qef election or a retroactive qef election 
as an alternative to making the qef election the us holder of pfic stock which is publicly traded may in certain circumstances avoid the tax consequences generally applicable to holders of a pfic by electing to mark the stock to market annually  recognizing as ordinary income or loss each year an amount equal to the difference as of the close of the taxable year between the fair market value of the pfic stock and the us holder s adjusted tax basis in the pfic stock 
losses would be allowed only to the extent of net mark to market gain previously included by the us holder under the election for prior taxable years 
this election is available for so long as our common shares constitute marketable stock 
the term marketable stock includes stock of a pfic that is regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market 
generally  a qualified exchange or other market means i a national securities exchange which is registered with the us securities and exchange commission or the national market system established pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act of or ii a foreign securities exchange that meets certain requirements 
a class of stock that is traded on one or more qualified exchanges or other markets is regularly traded on such exchanges or markets for any calendar year during which such class of stock is traded  other than in de minimis quantities  on at least days during each calendar quarter 
we believe that the nasdaq smallcap market will constitute a qualified exchange or other market for this purpose 
however  no assurances can be provided that our common shares will continue to trade on the nasdaq smallcap market  that the toronto stock exchange will be deemed to be a qualified exchange or other market for this purpose  or that the shares will be regularly traded for this purpose 
any us holder who owns  directly or indirectly  any stock in a pfic must file an annual return with the irs 
all us holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers about the pfic rules generally and about the advisability  requirements  procedures and timing of their making any of the available tax elections  including the qef or mark to market elections 
us backup withholding and information reporting a holder of solutions common shares may  under certain circumstances  be subject to certain information reporting requirements and backup withholding tax with respect to dividends paid on the solutions common shares  or the proceeds of sale of the solutions common shares  unless such holder i is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories  and when required  demonstrates this fact or ii provides a correct taxpayer identification number tin  certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules 
a holder of solutions common shares who does not provide a correct tin may be subject to penalties imposed by the us internal revenue service 
any amount withheld under backup withholding rules generally will be creditable against the holder s us federal income tax liability and a holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the irs 
the backup withholding tax rate is currently  and is scheduled to increase to after this tax discussion does not purport to contain a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax considerations relevant to the ownership of solutions common shares 
thus  solutions shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the ownership of solutions common shares  including tax return reporting requirements  the applicability and effect of federal  state  local  foreign and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws 
stockholders that are not us holders should consult their tax advisor regarding  among other things  the consequences of investing in solutions common shares under the foreign investment in real property tax act  including any reporting requirements that may apply 
material canadian income tax consequences the following discussion summarizes the principal canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable to a person  referred to as an investor  who holds common shares of solutions  and who at all material times for the purposes of the income tax act canada the act  deals at arm s length with us  is not affiliated with us  holds common shares as capital property  is a non resident of canada  and does not  and is not deemed to  use or hold any common share in  or in the course of  carrying on business in canada 
this summary is based on the current provisions of the act  including the regulations under the act  and the canada united states income tax convention  referred to as the treaty  as amended 
this summary takes into account all specific proposals to amend the act and the regulations under the act publicly announced by the government of canada prior to the date of this report  and our understanding of the current published administrative and assessing practices of the canada revenue agency 
it is assumed that all of those amendments will be enacted substantially as currently proposed  although no assurances can be given in this respect 
except to the extent otherwise expressly set out in this summary  this summary does not take into account any provincial  territorial  or foreign income tax law 
special rules  which are not discussed in this summary  may apply to a non resident holder that is an insurer carrying on business in canada and elsewhere  or a financial institution as defined by section of the act 
if you are in any doubt as to your tax position  you should consult with your tax advisor 
taxation of dividends any dividend on a common share paid or credited  or deemed under the act to be paid or credited  by us to an investor  will generally be subject to canadian withholding tax at the rate of on the gross amount of the dividend  or such lesser rates as may be available under an applicable income tax treaty 
we will be required to withhold any such tax from the dividend  and remit the tax directly to the canada revenue agency for the account of the investor 
pursuant to the treaty  the rate of withholding tax applicable to a dividend paid on a common share to an investor who is a resident of the united states for the purposes of the treaty will be reduced to if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a company that owns at least of our voting stock  and in any other case will be reduced to 
under the treaty  dividends paid or credited to an investor that is a united states tax exempt organization as described in article xxi of the treaty will not be subject to canadian withholding tax 
it is the position of the canada revenue agency that united states limited liability companies generally do not qualify as residents of the united states under the treaty and therefore treaty reductions are not available to those investors 
taxation of gain on disposition an investor generally will not be subject to tax pursuant to the act on any capital gain realized by the investor on a disposition of a common share unless the common share constitutes taxable canadian property to the investor for purposes of the act and the investor is not eligible for relief pursuant to an applicable bilateral tax treaty 
a common share that is disposed of by an investor will not constitute taxable canadian property of the investor provided that the common share is listed on a stock exchange that is prescribed for the purposes of the act the tsx and nasdaq are so prescribed  and that neither the investor  nor one or more persons with whom the investor did not deal at arm s length  alone or together  at any time in the five years immediately preceding the disposition  owned or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our capital stock 
even if a common share is taxable canadian property to an investor  the treaty will generally exempt an investor who is a resident of the united states for the purposes of the treaty  and who would otherwise be liable to pay canadian income tax in respect of any capital gain realized by the investor on the disposition of a common share  from that liability  provided that the value of the common share is not derived principally from real property situated in canada 
we are of the view that the value of the solutions common shares is not currently derived principally from real property situated in canada 
the treaty may not be available to a non resident investor that is a us limited liability company  which is not subject to tax in the united states 
the foregoing summary of material us and canadian tax consequences is based on the convention between canada and the united states of america with respect to taxes on income and capital gains  us law  canadian law  and regulations  administrative rulings and practices of the us and canada  all as they exist as of the date of this report 
this summary does not discuss all aspects that may be relevant to any particular investors in light of their particular circumstances 
investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to their own particular circumstances and with respect to the specific tax consequences of ownership of solutions common shares  including the applicability and effect of state  provincial  local and foreign tax laws  estate tax laws and proposed changes in applicable laws

mobile network operators are telecommunications companies that provide a range of mobile voice and data communications services to their consumer and business customers 
examples of large mobile network operators include verizon wireless  cingular wireless  sprint pcs  vodafone group and china mobile 
we offer software products that enable internet connectivity to mobile devices such as mobile phones and handheld computing devices 
we also offer software that helps to deliver text messaging  multimedia messaging  voice services and transactions to mobile network operators end user customers using mobile phones and handheld computing devices 
we were incorporated in and in we introduced our initial products 
initially  we focused on creating wireless software products that assisted financial services companies in making their traditional services available to their customers wirelessly from mobile phones and other handheld computing devices 
in january  we acquired tantau software with a view to expanding our customer base  utilizing tantau s software products to strengthen our products offered to financial services customers  and to expand our sales to mobile network operators 
in  we began offering our mobile alerting software products and our mobile internet gateway product software that enables internet connectivity to mobile devices to mobile network operators 
in october  our products and solutions for mobile network operators and other customers were re branded as the x treme mobility suite of products xms 
we no longer offer products developed specifically for financial institutions  although we continue to provide services to a small number of financial services customers and continue to support earlier sales to them 
during  we concluded that the adoption of wireless technologies by the financial services industry had slowed considerably 
at the same time  we judged that the market for mobile data services in the mobile network operator sector was potentially larger and likely to develop sooner 
as a consequence  we began a process to restructure the company to focus on business opportunities in the mobile network operator marketplace 
during  we completed this process and are now focused on selling our software products to mobile network operators 
we continue to develop and expand our x treme mobility suite of products for mobile network operators to assist them in growing their next generation data services 
in addition  we may in the future acquire products and or companies that have developed software that aligns with our x treme mobility suite of products 
developments in adoption of us generally accepted accounting principles for reporting purposes in prior years  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles and we have included a reconciliation to us generally accepted accounting principles 
for  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we have determined that this is appropriate as the majority of our shareholders reside in the united states 
comparative financial statements have been restated to reflect this change in basis of presentation and a reconciliation setting out the differences between us and canadian generally accepted accounting principles as applied to our consolidated financial statements is provided in note to our annual audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
convertible debt issuance to related party in the second quarter of  we arranged a private placement of secured convertible promissory notes with austin ventures  a related party  for a total principal amount of  austin ventures is our largest beneficial shareholder 
assuming that all of the notes are converted into common shares at the lowest possible conversion price on the maturity date  all accrued interest on the notes is paid with common shares  and that no additional common shares are issued  austin ventures could be deemed to beneficially own up to of our issued and outstanding common shares 
the first tranche of the financing involved the issuance of  of convertible notes and was completed on may  in accordance with the policies of the toronto stock exchange and the nasdaq national market  shareholder approval was required to complete the second tranche of the financing 
we obtained the approval on june  and completed the second tranche of the financing by issuing  of convertible notes 
the notes have a three year term and carry an interest rate of per quarter 
the notes are secured by substantially all of our assets 
all outstanding principal and interest is convertible into our common shares at a conversion price of per share 
if we issue any common shares or securities convertible into common shares at a price that is less than the conversion price of the notes then in effect  then the conversion price shall be subject to a weighted average anti dilution adjustment 
the conversion price will not be lowered by more than of the initial conversion price of 
the principal and interest payable at maturity can be converted into common shares of solutions at the option of austin ventures 
all interest accrued in the second and third quarters of plus of the interest charges thereafter are payable at maturity 
the periodic interest payments can be paid in common shares at our option at the conversion price then in effect on the interest payment date so long as the market price of the shares on that date is greater than the conversion price 
we also agreed to include two nominees from austin ventures in any slate of directors proposed for shareholder approval 
see note to our annual audited financial statements for year ended december  for further details as to the accounting treatment of these notes 
asset purchase in the second quarter of  we completed an agreement with nokia nyse nok to acquire the nokia multimedia application gateway agw product 
agw is a software product that provides subscriber functionality to a mobile network operator s multimedia messaging services 
agw has been decoupled from the mobile network operator s multimedia message delivery infrastructure  usually provided by a multimedia messaging service center mmsc  so that new multimedia functionality can be added into agw  allowing mobile network operators to rapidly deploy new multimedia services  without the need to update their messaging infrastructure 
the current subscriber functionality provided by agw is legacy device support  email smart push and multimedia album 
legacy device support as mobile network operators offer multimedia services  such as picture messaging take a picture using a camera phone  and send it  the subscribers to whom they can offer these services is limited to those subscribers with multimedia capable terminals 
with legacy device support  subscribers who do not have multimedia capable terminals can still participate in multimedia services 
these subscribers receive a text message with a link to a website where they can view the multimedia messages sent to them 
this expands the addressable subscriber base for multimedia services 
email smart push esp esp allows multimedia subscribers to send multimedia messages to email addresses versus phone numbers 
this expands the addressable subscriber base for multimedia services 
multimedia album the multimedia album is a web based service that allows subscribers to create  edit  store  send and share multimedia messages 
additionally  subscribers can upload multimedia messages from their terminals into their albums  and upload media from their pcs into their album 
in the transaction  we purchased approximately  of development hardware that was deployed in the toronto development center 
we also signed an oem agreement under which nokia will continue to offer the product to its existing and future customers 
restructuring and other charges during  we determined it was appropriate to implement additional cost reductions 
these efforts were implemented in order to reduce our total cost of revenue  development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs from approximately million in the first quarter of to approximately million in the fourth quarter of  excluding any hardware costs that may be part of a sale to a customer 
as part of these restructuring efforts  we reduced our worldwide work force by people in professional services  in sales and marketing  in research and development  and in general and administration 
this headcount reduction was a result of consolidating development and g a personnel by closing our offices in germany and finland  and reducing our marketing and sales employees from whom we did not expect to generate significant revenue 
these activities were substantially completed by june at december   we had no significant remaining obligations due to our restructurings 
in the first quarter of  we initially announced that we would reduce our headcount by approximately people 
with the acquisition of the agw product in the second quarter  the additional terminations planned in the first quarter were not carried out  as these development staff were redeployed to develop and support the agw product 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded million in restructuring charges during of which  related to severance and  related to lease exit costs 
this amount was offset by a reduction of  in our restructuring reserve  as hosting exit costs were lower than we had projected 
the million amount is the net of the million restructuring charge in the first quarter and the  reversal in the second quarter as described above  and an additional  reversal in the fourth quarter 
included in our accrued liabilities as at december  is approximately  in restructuring reserve related to a restructuring activity undertaken in  specifically to costs associated with an office in europe that we have vacated 
although the space is sublet  we are obligated to refurbish the space at the end of the lease 
we expect to pay out the remaining balance by the end of the first quarter of we evaluate costs on an ongoing basis to determine if costs of a particular product or function are warranted given the anticipated revenue from that product or function 
see note to our annual audited financial statements for year ended december  for further details 
critical accounting policies we periodically review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
as part of this process  we have reviewed our selection  application and communication of critical accounting policies and financial disclosures 
we have determined that our critical accounting policies relating to our core ongoing business activities are primarily those that relate to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts  iii income taxes  iv litigation  v valuation of intangible assets  vi valuation of fixed assets  and vii restructuring provisions 
sources of revenue we derive revenue from licensing our products and providing related services  including installation  integration  maintenance and support 
we recognize revenue from our license agreements when all the following conditions are met we have an executed license agreement with the customer  we have delivered the software product to the customer  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable  and collection of these fees is deemed probable 
software license agreements can be multiple element arrangements that include related maintenance and implementation fees 
accordingly  the fee is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the respective vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe of each element in accordance with statement of position sop for these multiple element contracts falling under sop for which we do not have sufficient vsoe  we use the residual method to record revenues 
under this method  if we have vsoe for all undelivered elements typically  services and maintenance we record the remaining value of the contract as license revenue after allocating full value to the undelivered elements 
in some software license agreements  some of our products cannot be considered off the shelf and the contracted deliverables and professional services fees may be essential to the functionality of the software 
in these circumstances  we recognize revenue as the deliverables and services are performed and revenue is earned in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
for license and services agreements that provide significant commitments to refunds and or penalties on the services and or license components should the system not perform according to documented specifications  we defer recognition of revenue for the amount subject to refund or penalty until we achieve contractually defined milestones or until customer acceptance has occurred  as the case may be for those agreements 
we typically license our software on a per user or per transaction basis 
accordingly  our revenue is dependent on whether  and the extent to which our customers continue to use our software 
however  in the case of our amended agreement with hewlett packard in connection with hewlett packard s re licensing of our software to sprint pcs  we license our software on a quarterly and monthly fixed fee basis 
if  at any time and for any reason  sprint pcs decides to no longer use our software for additional customers  hewlett packard will cease paying the quarterly monthly fixed fees and we will not receive any further license fees under the agreement 
product revenue product revenue consists of the following variable license fee arrangement a variable license fee based on the numbers of users or the total capacity in a period 
revenue is recognized on an ongoing basis when determinable and will vary with the number or the total capacity of our customers end users 
in some of our agreements  there may be a cap on the total license fees paid by our customer for a particular product 
reseller oem arrangement the reseller or oem typically pays a non refundable licensing fee for our software and or a royalty fee based on the related number of users or based on a given capacity 
we recognize revenue associated with non refundable license fees when we have met our revenue recognition criteria for license agreements as outlined above 
we recognize royalty fee revenue when the amount is determinable and all of our other revenue recognition criteria for license revenue are met 
fixed license fee arrangement a license fee for a fixed number of copies or unlimited use of the software for a period of time ranging from months to perpetuity 
if the license is not a perpetual license  we recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the license 
if the license is a perpetual license  we recognize the revenue when general conditions outlined above under sources of revenue are met 
service revenue implementation and customer service fees revenue from implementation and customer service fees includes fees for implementation of our product offerings which may include hardware and third party software operating on the hardware  consulting and training services 
customers are charged a fee based on time and expenses and a fee for the hardware and third party software they choose to buy from us 
revenue is recognized as the implementation is performed or as the hardware is delivered and accepted or deferred until we achieve contractually defined milestones or until customer acceptance has occurred  as the case may be  for those contracts 
maintenance fees we receive revenue from maintaining and servicing our products for customers 
the maintenance fee is typically equal to a specified percentage of the customer s cumulative license fees  and may include a minimum quarterly amount 
if associated with the fixed fee license model  the maintenance revenues received will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
when associated with the variable fee license model  any maintenance payments will be recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
managed alerts service fees we receive revenue from providing services to our customers using our managed x treme alerts platform 
these can include revenue from voice alerts  short message service sms alerts  multimedia message mms alerts  fraud alerts  and collection alerts 
our xap software is hosted in new jersey with computer sciences corporation and the voice hardware is hosted in florida with intervoice 
customers typically pay a per alert fee  subject to monthly minimums 
the fees are recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our general credit terms are to days from the invoice date 
we perform an ongoing credit evaluation of each customer s financial condition and if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payment  an additional allowance would be required 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts totals  our maximum exposure to loss on receivables at any point in time is the total accounts receivable  which was million at december  due to the significant number of estimates utilized in determining an expected rate of uncollectible receivables  actual results of collections could be materially different from these estimates 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when we believe it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and the potential for realization due to tax planning strategies 
at december   while we have million in available net tax benefit of loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets  we have experienced losses in recent years and the extent of future income for tax purposes before utilization of these benefits is uncertain 
accordingly  the entire balance of deferred tax assets has been reduced by a valuation allowance 
due to the significant number of estimates and projections utilized in determining an appropriate valuation for our deferred income tax assets  the actual valuation allowance against the tax assets could be materially different from these estimates 
litigation we are a party  from time to time  in legal proceedings such as the securities litigation relating to our initial public offering see item legal proceedings 
in these cases  we assess the likelihood that a loss will result  as well as the amount of that loss  and the financial statements provide for the best estimate of the losses 
in making our assessment of the existence of loss  we consider advice from legal counsel  the nature of the claim and other settlements  if any  that are occurring from similar claims 
to the extent that any of these legal proceedings are resolved and require us to pay an amount in excess of what has been provided for in the financial statements  we would be required to record  against earnings  the excess at that time 
if the resolution resulted in a gain  or a loss less than that provided for  the gain is recognized when received or receivable 
valuation of intangible assets we have acquired several other businesses 
as part of the completion of any business combination  we are required to value any intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition 
we utilize the most current internally generated and publicly available information to develop an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows including  among other things  estimated lives  residual values and terminal values  and believe the estimates to be reasonable at the date prepared 
this valuation is inherently subjective  and necessarily involves judgments and estimates regarding future cash flows and other operational variables of the intangible assets acquired 
there can be no assurance that the judgments and estimates made at the date of acquisition will reflect future performance of the acquired intangible assets 
to assist us with the valuation process  we have adopted the practice of using independent valuation experts in the valuation process for intangible assets acquired through material acquisitions 
however  it is entirely possible that either we or the independent valuation experts will make judgments or estimates that differ from actual circumstances 
in these cases  we may be required to record a provision or write off certain of our intangible assets 
similarly  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to annually test the value of our goodwill 
changes in estimates could result in different conclusions for the underlying value of goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment testing on goodwill at december of each fiscal year  provided that circumstances do not arise during the year that would necessitate an earlier evaluation 
over the past three years  our book value has exceeded our fair value and we have recorded impairment charges to reflect these assessments 
as at december   the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets has been written down to nil 
valuation of fixed assets we monitor the appropriateness of the carrying values of our fixed assets  primarily office furniture and computer software and equipment  on an ongoing basis  in accordance with accounting requirements 
as required  if an indicator of potential impairment is evident  we will review the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the relevant fixed asset  to determine if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the fixed asset 
if it is determined that the net carrying amount of the fixed asset is not recoverable  then an adjustment would be made to reduce the net carrying amount to the fair value amount of the asset 
we utilize the most current internally generated and publicly available information to develop our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows including  among other things  estimated lives  residual values and terminal values  and believe the estimates to be reasonable 
additionally  determination of fair values of fixed assets may also involve various methods of estimation  if comparable independent fair values are not readily available 
accordingly  different assumptions related to cash flows or fair values of fixed assets could materially affect our estimates 
we have recorded charges to write down fixed assets  primarily arising due to the restructuring activities we have undertaken 
as at december   our net book value of fixed assets was million 
restructuring provisions we record restructuring provisions when specified criteria under accounting principles are met 
while these provisions are substantially based on contractual terms  it is necessary to make estimates of the fair values of liabilities in some circumstances  primarily when the charge includes future costs to be incurred on leased space which is no longer being used but for which the lease agreement has not been terminated 
in these cases  we estimate the fair value of future sub lease rentals that will be realized over the term of the agreement 
these estimates take into account expected demands and prices available for the specific space in the areas the lease is located 
unless we have a fixed sub lease for the remaining term of the lease arrangement  the actual amount of sub lease rental income may differ from the estimates used in developing the provision and those changes may be material 
changes in estimated sub lease income are recognized as determinable 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our consolidated financial statements for have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue product revenue in the year ended december   product revenue increased to million from million in revenue from our x treme mobility suite of products increased to million in from million in our principal revenue producing deployments for xms were hewlett packard as a reseller to sprint pcs  nokia and a european mno 
hewlett packard as a reseller to sprint pcs contributed  of the increase in our xms product revenue through strong continued customer adoption of mobile data services on sprint s pcs vision network 
our oem relationship with nokia contributed million of the increase and a european xmg customer accounted for  of the increase 
the increases were partially offset by decreasing product revenue at other deployments  most notably at radiolinja origo  where product revenue declined by  in compared to  as the amount included a one time license fee 
in  the xmg product accounted for approximately of our revenue from xms and the agw product  the new product purchased from nokia in  accounted for approximately of the xms revenue 
in  our xmg product accounted for approximately of the xms revenue 
while we provide our customers with fixed or variable pricing alternatives  in  as in  essentially all of our key revenue producing contracts for the xms suite were on a variable pricing model 
we anticipate that the xms products will generate most of our product revenue in during and  product revenue from the financial services industry was  and million  respectively  as some older contracts ended and were not renewed by our financial services customers 
we will continue to perform under the contracts we currently have with our financial services customers 
we anticipate that revenue from these customers in will remain close to levels or decline slightly 
our ability to achieve this revenue  however  is dependent on our remaining financial services customers renewing their contracts 
service revenue service revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million in in  service revenue from xms increased to million from million in implementation and customer service fee revenue was million in compared to million in approximately of the increase was a result of the delivery of hardware to a customer  and the remaining increase was a result of increased implementation revenue related to our xmg revenue 
managed alerts services revenue was  in compared to nil in  primarily due to one customer adopting this platform as a key part of its customer retention and loyalty program 
maintenance revenue  mainly from hewlett packard as a reseller to sprint pcs and nokia totaled million  up million from in the previous year 
maintenance from hewlett packard as a reseller to sprint pcs increased due to a significantly increased subscriber base using sprint pcs services  while the agw product maintenance revenue was  in service revenue from the financial services industry was million in  down from million in  as our older contracts were not renewed by our financial services customers  resulting in less service work for these customers 
operating expenses cost of product revenue our product revenue consists of the sale of software licenses typically on a per user or on a capacity basis 
there are no significant out of pocket costs associated with the manufacturing of our software 
costs that are associated with our software are as follows development costs software development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established  which generally occurs upon completion of a working model  and ending when a product is available for general release to customers 
all subsequent costs are expensed as incurred 
to date  the completion of working models of our products has substantially coincided with the general release of the products 
as a result  we have not capitalized any software development costs  since those costs have not been significant 
amortization of intangible assets this includes intellectual property that we have acquired and either license as a stand alone product or embed in our software product 
the acquired software products are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of two to five years 
all acquired software products had been fully amortized or written down to nil by the end of september see note of our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the amount amortized in was nil compared to in other some of our products include third party embedded software 
in  we recorded  of license fees to third party vendors for the use of their software that has been embedded in our software 
cost of product revenue also includes the cost of third party inventory purchased from third parties and sold to our customers 
in as in  we did not purchase or sell any third party inventory to our customers 
cost of services revenue cost of services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training and implementations  as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services  together with an allocation of expenses for our facilities and administration 
it also includes the cost of hardware and third party software that our customers desire us to purchase and resell to them 
cost of services revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in  an increase of 
included in the amount is approximately  in hardware costs related to a customer deployment 
our average professional services headcount was in and we ended and with and professional services personnel respectively 
cost of services revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in research and development research and development expenses include compensation of software development teams working on the continuing enhancement of our products as well as our quality assurance and testing activities 
these expenses also include the cost of retaining independent contractors and consultants  software licensing expenses  and allocated operating expenses 
research and development r d expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  a reduction of 
the decrease is a result of our restructuring initiatives  as a result of which we reduced our average r d headcount to in from in  a reduction of 
we ended and with and research and development personnel respectively 
in addition  through our restructuring initiatives  we reduced the average cost per development employee by approximately  by locating more of our development team in a more cost effective location 
we estimate these savings to be approximately million 
we continue to evaluate our r d expenditure needs based on our new product architecture and services and the current market environment 
we anticipate that we will hire additional development personnel in r d expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include compensation of sales and marketing personnel  public relations and advertising  trade shows  marketing materials and allocated operating expenses 
sales and marketing s m expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million in  a reduction of 
the decrease is a result of the reduction in the average number of sales and marketing personnel to in from in a reduction of and a  or reduction on marketing expenditures primarily related to public relations and industry events 
we ended and with and sales and marketing personnel respectively 
we continue to monitor our sales and marketing expenditures to ensure that they remain aligned with our targeted opportunities as well as prevailing market conditions 
s m expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses include salaries and benefits for corporate personnel and other general and administrative expenses such as facilities  travel and professional consulting costs 
our corporate staff includes executive officers and business development  financial planning and control  legal  human resources and corporate administration staff 
g a expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in a reduction of 
the decrease in g a expenses reflects our restructuring initiatives through which we reduced our average yearly headcount in g a to in from in  a reduction of 
we ended and with and general and administrative staff respectively 
the reduction in personnel together with a reduction in our insurance costs primarily our directors and officers insurance and legal fees resulted in savings of approximately   and  respectively 
g a expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in we believe that we will need to add additional staff in this area in the coming year to address the increased level of regulatory compliance in today s environment 
depreciation depreciation expense was  in the year ended december   compared to  in depreciation decreased as we continue to utilize fully depreciated fixed assets 
we have recently begun to reinvest in fixed assets and anticipate that we will make further purchases of fixed assets in stock based compensation effective january   we prospectively adopted the fair value accounting for stock based awards  as prescribed by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
prior to january   we elected not to apply fair value accounting to stock based awards to employees  other than for direct awards of stock and awards settleable in cash  which required fair value accounting 
prior to january   for awards not elected to be accounted for under the fair value method  we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
apb is based upon an intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
under this method  compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock issuance at the measurement date over the amount to be paid by the employee 
we adopted fair value accounting for stock based awards using the prospective application transitional alternative available in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
accordingly  the fair value method is applied to all awards granted  modified or settled on or after january  under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the service period  that is the award s vesting period 
when awards are exercised  share capital is credited by the sum of the consideration paid together with the related portion previously credited to additional paid in capital when compensation costs were charged against income or acquisition consideration 
stock based awards that are settled in cash or may be settled in cash at the option of employees are recorded as liabilities 
the measurement of the liability and compensation cost for these awards is based on the intrinsic value of the award  and is recorded into operating income over the service period  that is the vesting period of the award 
changes in our payment obligation subsequent to vesting of the award and prior to the settlement date are recorded as compensation cost over the service period in operating income 
stock based awards that are settled in cash or equity at our option o are recorded at fair value on the date of grant and recorded as additional paid in capital 
the fair value measurement of the compensation cost for these awards is based on the black scholes option pricing model  and is recorded in operating income over the service period  that is the vesting period of the award 
when awards are exercised  share capital is credited with the related portion previously credited to additional paid in capital 
stock based compensation decreased to  for the year ended december   all related to the fair value of options granted in and  compared to million for the year ended december  the expense included million related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation recorded as a result of assuming  through business acquisitions  stock option plans that included unvested options and common shares 
restructuring costs during  we determined it was appropriate to implement additional cost reductions 
these efforts were implemented in order to reduce our total cost of revenue  development  sales and marketing and general and administration costs from approximately million in the first quarter of to just over million  excluding hardware costs included in cost of revenue  in the fourth quarter of as part of these restructuring efforts  we reduced our worldwide work force by people in professional services  in sales and marketing  in research and development  and in general and administration 
this headcount reduction was a result of consolidating development and g a personnel by closing our offices in germany and finland  and reducing our marketing and sales employees from whom we did not expect to generate significant revenue 
these activities were substantially completed by june additional terminations planned in the first quarter were not carried out due to the nokia asset purchase in the second quarter 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded million in restructuring charges of which approximately  related to severance and  related to lease exit costs 
the million number is the net of the million restructuring charge in the first quarter and the  reversal in the second quarter 
included in our accrued liabilities as at december  is approximately  in remaining obligations arising from a restructuring activity undertaken in specifically  it relates to the remaining costs associated with an office in europe that we have vacated 
although the space is sublet  we are obligated to refurbish the space at the end of the lease 
we will pay out the remaining balance by the end of the first quarter of we continue to evaluate costs on an ongoing basis to determine if costs of a particular product or function are warranted given the anticipated revenue from or contribution to the business of that product or function 
write down of goodwill  intangibles and other assets sfas no 
requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment only  rather than being amortized  on a prospective basis starting january  see significant accounting policies  note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we assessed the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our net assets approximately million including the amount then assigned to goodwill to the quoted market price which we believe is an indicator our the fair market value of our stock approximately million calculated using the average closing price of our shares on the nasdaq stock market on the business days in december of 
based on this analysis  we concluded that an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill had occurred 
after allocating our fair value to the fair value of our tangible and intangible assets which we estimated to be higher than the book value the resulting implied value of goodwill was determined to be nil 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of million 
as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  at the end of  the carrying value of goodwill was nil 
interest expense we had a net interest expense of  in the year ended december   compared to net interest income of  in we issued million in convertible notes in the second quarter of  the interest expense associated with this debt was  in interest derived from cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments  representing primarily the unused portion of the proceeds from our issuances of common shares as well as from the convertible debt financing completed in the second quarter of was  in in  interest income in was net of interest expense related to a note payable 
the note was fully repaid by the end of the first quarter of net interest expense is expected to be approximately  in   in interest charges relate to the convertible notes payable to related parties offset by interest income of approximately  net loss our net loss decreased to million for year ended december  compared to million in our net loss has decreased due to a number of factors 
our revenue increased by million and we had lower operating costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives 
we wrote down the remaining goodwill of million in and amortized the remaining intangible assets of million 
stock based compensation charges decreased significantly in to  from million in and depreciation expenses were lower by  in compared to developments in restructuring and other charges during  we determined it was appropriate to implement additional cost reductions 
these efforts were implemented in order to reduce our total cost structure from approximately million in the first quarter of to a total cost structure of million in the third quarter of on an operational basis  we anticipate that we will save approximately million in cash per quarter as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
as part of these restructuring efforts  we reduced our worldwide work force by approximately people in professional services  in sales and marketing  in research and development  and in general and administration 
this headcount reduction was a result of eliminating redundant development personnel by closing our chicago office  and reducing our marketing and sales employees that we did not expect to generate significant revenue 
this restructuring activity also resulted in a significant reduction to our personnel in our toronto office  which reduced our exposure to movements in the canadian dollar  but resulted in a proportionate increase in our exposure to the euro 
these activities were substantially completed by june however  we continue to monitor our costs and expenses on an ongoing basis and seek to reduce them when feasible 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded  in restructuring charges of which  related to severance and  related to lease exit costs 
the reductions were mostly offset by a reduction to our hosting exit reserve by  from the unpaid amount originally accrued in with respect to a restructuring implemented at that time  as actual hosting related costs were lower than our original estimate see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
specifically  we adjusted our hosting reserve because a one of our customers reduced its hosting requirements resulting in projected savings relative to the remaining amount accrued of  and b we renegotiated our contract with our hosting provider resulting in projected savings relative to the remaining amount accrued of  write down of goodwill sfas no 
and the canadian institute of chartered accountants handbook section require goodwill to be assessed for impairment only  rather than being amortized  on a prospective basis starting january  see significant accounting policies  note to our consolidated financial statements 

in  we assessed the carrying value of our goodwill 
we compared the carrying value of our net assets approximately million including the amount then assigned to goodwill to the quoted market price which we believe is an indicator our the fair market value of our stock approximately million calculated using the average closing price of our shares on the nasdaq stock market on the business days in december of 
based on this analysis  we concluded that an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill had occurred 
after allocating our fair value to the fair value of our tangible and intangible assets which we estimated to be higher than the book value the resulting implied value of goodwill was determined to be zero 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of million 
as described in note b of our consolidated financial statements  at the end of  the carrying value of goodwill was zero 
reverse stock split on april   our shareholders approved a ten for one reverse stock split of our common shares 
as a result  the historic number of shares  historic loss per share and the weighted average number of shares used in compiling basic and diluted loss per share have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split 
stock based compensation prior to january   we applied the intrinsic method of accounting to employee stock options 
under this method  deferred stock based compensation is recorded only if the current market value of the underlying common share exceeds the exercise price per share on the date of grant 
the cica accounting standards board has amended handbook section  stock based compensation and other stock based payments hb to require entities to account for employee stock options using the fair value based method beginning january   and encouraged companies to adopt early in we have chosen to early adopt the fair value based method on a prospective basis in under both hb in canada and fas for us gaap reporting 
since the total stock option expense for using the fair value based method is only  we have determined that it is not necessary to restate our quarterly results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue product revenue in the year ended december   product revenue decreased to million from million in starting in and continuing through  we increased our focus on positioning and selling our products to mnos  while decreasing our focus on selling our products to the financial services industry 
revenue from our xms products that were positioned to be sold to the mno market increased to million in from million in our principal revenue producing deployments for the xms products were to hewlett packard as a reseller to sprint pcs  radiolinja eesti and radiolinja finland  with sprint contributing the majority of this revenue based on their customer adoption of mobile data services on their pcs vision network by the end of hewlett packard accounted for approximately million of the increase and radiolinja finland and eesti accounted for approximately million 
our xmg product accounted for over of the revenue from xms and our xsam product accounted for approximately of the revenue in  while our xmg product and xsam product accounted for and in the increase in the percentage attributable to xmg was primarily due to the strong adoption of wireless subscribers at sprint pcs  resulting in increased revenue from hewlett packard 
while we provide our customers with fixed or variable pricing alternatives  in  as in  essentially all of our key revenue producing contracts for the xms suite were on a variable pricing model 
we did not experience any material changes in our pricing model between and but anticipate that per user or per transaction prices will likely decline as software similar to ours becomes more widely adopted in the marketplace 
we typically license our software on a per user or per transaction basis 
accordingly  our revenue is dependent on whether  and the extent to which our customers continue to use our software 
during and  product revenue from the financial services industry was million and million  respectively  as older contracts approached their termination dates and were not renewed by our financial services customers 
we will continue to perform under the contracts we currently have with financial services customers but we anticipate that revenue from these customers will be significantly less than our ability to achieve this revenue  however  is dependent on our remaining financial services customers renewing their contracts 
service revenue service revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease was a result of changing our customer focus to mnos and our product focus to the x treme mobility suite of products 
in  service revenue from our xms products decreased to million from million in while the number of service revenue producing installations in the mno sector increased to in from in  the complexity and scope of customizations required by our customers on initial deployment of our products decreased 
this decrease was a direct result of the specific requirements of the customers who purchased our product in in  hewlett packard as reseller to sprint pcs required a very complex  customized solution that generated approximately million in service revenue  while our customers in often decided to deploy our products with minimal customization 
the development of our product had also progressed in so that some features previously available only through customization were now incorporated into the product 
while this further development may lead to lower services revenue on the future initial deployment of our products  we believe these enhancements in our products will result in a lower cost of ownership for our customers resulting in a greater number of deployments and greater market share 
service revenue from the financial services industry was million in  down from million in as our older contracts approached their termination and were not renewed by our financial services customers  resulting in less service work for these customers 
operating expenses cost of product revenue cost of product revenue consists primarily of the amortization of software products acquired by us through business acquisitions completed in and the acquired software products and their related technologies are embedded in the products we licensed to our customers 
the acquired software products are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
in  the amount amortized was million compared to in the reduction is due to the fact that the acquired software products were completely amortized by the end of september cost of product revenue also included the cost of inventory purchased from third parties and sold to our customers and the write off of excess inventory 
in  we did not purchase or sell any inventory to our customers 
as part of our restructuring in  we reduced the number of products we were selling to the marketplace  and accordingly expensed the remaining value of inventory we had purchased in the amount of million 
cost of services revenue cost of services revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in  a reduction of 
the decrease is a result of our restructuring initiatives through which we reduced our average professional services headcount from in to in a reduction of 
we ended and with and professional services personnel respectively 
the percentage reduction in average headcount is greater than the percentage reduction in dollars as the average cost of those employees who we terminated was lower than those employees that remained 
cost of services revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in research and development research and development r d expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  a reduction of 
the decrease is a result of our decision to focus on the market for mobile data services in the mobile network operator sector through which we reduced our average r d headcount from in to in a reduction of 
we ended and with and research and development personnel respectively 
the percentage reduction in average headcount is greater than the percentage reduction in dollars as the average cost of those employees who we terminated was lower than those employees that remained 
we believe our current r d staff is sufficient to build the products we license in the mobile network operator sector and will continue to evaluate our r d expenditure needs based on our new product architecture and services and the current market environment 
for a further discussion of our decision to focus on the mobile network operator sector and its impact on our business  please see the section entitled restructuring below

the decrease is a result of our decision to focus on the market for mobile data services in the mobile network operator sector 
we reduced the average number of sales and marketing personnel from in to in a reduction of 
we ended and with and sales and marketing personnel respectively 
this reduction was necessary to bring the size of the sales force in line with our projected revenue 
the reduction to the sales force was also designed to address the specific market upon which we are currently focused 
the amount also reflects a reduction of approximately  in our spending on discretionary marketing programs  primarily achieved through reduced public relations reduction of  and reduced company sales events reduction of 
for a further discussion of our decision to focus on the mobile network operator sector  please see the section entitled restructuring below 
we continue to monitor our sales and marketing expenditures to ensure that they remain aligned with our targeted opportunities as well as prevailing market conditions 
s m expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in general and administrative g a expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in a reduction of 
the decrease in g a expenses reflects our restructuring initiatives in which we have reduced our average yearly headcount in g a from in to in  a reduction of 
the reduction in personnel accounted for approximately million of the decrease in g a expenses 
we ended and with and g a headcount respectively 
as part of our decision to focus on the market for mobile data services in the mobile network operator sector  we closed certain offices and simplified our general and administrative functions  such as corporate procurement  resulting in the need for significantly fewer g a personnel in order to efficiently conduct our operations 
the percentage reduction in average headcount is greater than the percentage reduction in dollars as the average cost of those employees who we terminated was lower than those employees that remained

g a expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in depreciation depreciation expense was  in the year ended december   compared to million in depreciation decreased significantly because we wrote off approximately of fixed assets in as a result of our restructuring and a significant portion of our remaining assets  specifically software  became fully depreciated in the write off included data center and computer equipment of million and office furniture and leasehold improvements of million 
the fixed asset write off resulted in a reduction in depreciation of million in compared to also  we purchased significant amounts of software in that were depreciated over twelve months 
because we reduced capital expenditures in  our depreciation expense related to software was reduced in depreciation expense related to software was lower by million in compared to due to our restructurings  which included exiting the hosting business  our capital acquisitions totaled  in we believe we have sufficient assets to run our business but do anticipate we will need to add to our fixed assets in stock based compensation stock based compensation decreased to million for the year ended december   including  related to the fair value of options granted in  compared to million in the comparative period in the expense included significant charges related to the immediate recognition of deferred stock based compensation associated with employees who were terminated as part of our restructuring plan as well as the immediate recognition of the unamortized portion of the deferred stock compensation for those employees who tendered their options as part of our stock option exchange initiative in january in addition  the deferred stock compensation associated with the tantau acquisition was higher in as it was fully amortized by the end of january restructuring costs during  we determined it was appropriate to implement additional cost reductions 
these efforts were implemented in order to reduce our total cost structure from approximately million in the first quarter of to a projected total cost structure of million in the third quarter of on an operational basis  we anticipate that we will save approximately million in cash per quarter as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
as part of these restructuring efforts  we reduced our worldwide work force by approximately people in professional services  in sales and marketing  in research and development  and in general and administration 
this headcount reduction was a result of eliminating redundant development personnel by closing our chicago office  and reducing our marketing and sales employees from whom we did not expect to generate significant revenue 
this restructuring activity also resulted in a significant cut to our personnel in our toronto office  which reduced our exposure to movements in the canadian dollar  but resulted in a proportionate increase in our exposure to the euro 
these activities were substantially completed by june as a result of these transactions  we recorded  in restructuring charges of which  related to severance and  related to lease exit costs 
the reductions were mostly offset by a reduction to our hosting exit reserve by  from the unpaid amount originally accrued in with respect to a restructuring done at that time  as actual hosting related costs were lower than our original estimate see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
specifically  we adjusted our hosting reserve because a one of our customers reduced its hosting requirements resulting in projected savings of  and b we renegotiated our contract with our hosting partner resulting in projected savings of included in our accrued liabilities as at december  is approximately million in restructuring reserve 
this includes severance costs of  lease exit costs of  and hosting exit costs of  see note to our annual audited consolidated financial statements for further details 
in  we recorded million in restructuring charges 
during  we concluded that the adoption of wireless technologies by the financial services industry had slowed considerably 
at the same time  we judged that the market for mobile data services in the mobile network operator sector was potentially larger and likely to develop sooner 
as a consequence  we began a process to restructure our company to focus on the pursuit of business in the mobile network operator marketplace 
during  we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately people and recorded approximately million in severance charges and closed our offices or significantly reduced our office space in toronto and recorded approximately million in lease exit costs 
in addition  as part of that restructuring  we formed a three year alliance with computer sciences corporation csc to support our then current hosting agreements and recorded a charge of approximately million 
the total restructuring charge in was million 
in addition to the restructuring charge  we wrote off approximately million of inventory  comprised of million in sms messages and software licenses of  when we determined we would be unable to resell this inventory  and recorded a charge of million for the write down of fixed assets  comprised of data center and computer equipment of million and office furniture and leasehold improvements of million 
the restructuring activities undertaken in were completed within the year  shortly after the reduction in the workforce occurred in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
all amounts provided for were settled in the year except for i severance in the amount of  which was settled in  ii lease exit costs related to abandoned premises in the amount of  that continues to be paid over the term of the leases having of which  remained outstanding as at december   and iii hosting exit costs in the amount of  which are being settled over a three year period  of which  remain outstanding as at december  the severance amounts were paid in the first half of  of the lease exit costs were paid in in  the company paid  and also negotiated a reduction in the amounts owing under the hosting arrangement  thereby reducing the amount of the future payments by as we have indicated  we evaluate costs on an ongoing basis to determine if costs of a particular product or function are warranted given the anticipated revenue from that product or function 
write down of goodwill  intangibles and other assets sfas no 
and the canadian institute of chartered accountants handbook section require goodwill to be assessed for impairment only  rather than being amortized  on a prospective basis starting january  see significant accounting policies  note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we assessed the carrying value of our goodwill 
we compared the carrying value of our net assets approximately million  including the amount then assigned to goodwill to the quoted market price which we believe is an indicator our fair market value of our stock approximately million calculated using the average closing price of our shares on the nasdaq stock market on the business days in december 
based on this analysis  we concluded that an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill had occurred 
after allocating our fair value to the fair value of our tangible and intangible assets which we estimated to be higher than the book value the resulting implied value of goodwill was determined to be zero 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of million 
at the end of  the carrying value of goodwill was zero 
interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  in interest was derived from cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments  representing primarily the unused portion of the proceeds from our issuances of common shares 
interest income is net of interest expense relating to a note payable 
the note was fully repaid by the end of the first quarter of interest income decreased in compared to due to declining interest rates and because we had reduced holdings of cash  cash equivalent balances and short term investments 
net loss our net loss decreased to million for year ended december  compared to million in our net loss has decreased due to a number of factors 
we incurred significant restructuring charges and write downs of intangible and fixed assets in related to our restructuring efforts 
stock based compensation charges and depreciation expense decreased significantly in and our restructuring initiatives have resulted in significantly lower operating costs 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial information as of december   and in thousands as at december cash and cash equivalents short term investments restricted cash working capital current assets less current liabilities at december   our cash and short term investments were million compared to million in  a reduction of million

our accounts receivables balance as at december  was million  with over of the balance being either current or less than days past due 
we did not incur any bad debt expense in or in and we believe that the current reserve of  is sufficient and that accounts receivable will be collected 
our accrued liabilities balance of million includes approximately  of restructuring reserves that we anticipate will be paid in other accrued liabilities and accounts payable are anticipated to remain at approximately the same levels

we expect our quarterly cash expenditures in to increase somewhat from the million achieved in the fourth quarter of  as we add additional headcount to our development and on site support teams to support our customer installations  but we will maintain our focus on cost management 
we estimate our projected cash needs for to be approximately to million  including capital expenditures 
most of our revenue contracts are based on a per user  per transaction or quarterly or monthly fixed fee basis 
if our customers  or our largest customer hewlett packard as reseller to sprint pcs decides not to use our software or increase their use of our software  our license and maintenance and support revenue will be significantly negatively impacted 
we anticipate that our cash on hand  together with our cash from operations will be sufficient to cover our cash requirements for at least the next months 
while we have no current plans to raise additional capital  we will consider any appropriate plans  proposals or arrangements to raise additional capital if we determine that doing so is necessary or desirable to expand or continue our business operations 
we may require additional financing if we expand our operations at a faster rate than currently expected  if our costs unexpectedly increase  if our revenues decrease  if we lose one or more significant customers including hewlett packard  or if we seek to effect one or more significant acquisitions

differences in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented under canadian gaap under canadian securities requirements  we are required to provide supplemental information to highlight significant differences that would have resulted in the information provided in this section had we prepared it our using canadian gaap financial information 
there were no differences between the company s financial statements as prepared under us and canadian gaap for the year ended december  and we have identified and disclosed the significant differences between canadian and us gaap as applied to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the only gaap differences impacting the components of operating loss are the application under canadian gaap of the requirement to account for the convertible notes as a compound instrument and the requirement to separate the instrument into a liability and equity component 
under canadian gaap  we calculated the liability component of the secured convertible notes as the present value of the future obligation using a discount rate of 
the liability component amounted to approximately million 
the residual amount of  represents the estimated equity component for the conversion option and is recorded under canadian gaap as the equity portion of the secured convertible notes 
the difference between the amounts allocated to the liability and the principal amount of the notes of million is being amortized as non cash imputed interest expense over the period to maturity and the liability is being accreted up to its maturity value 
the additional interest expense for the year ended december  amounted to additionally  under us gaap  the costs related to the issuance of the secured convertible notes payable are recorded as a long term asset and are amortized over the term of the notes 
for canadian gaap purposes  these costs are allocated on a pro rata basis between the debt and equity components of the compound instruments 
the amount allocated to the debt component has been recorded as a long term asset and amortized over the term of the notes  and the amount allocated to the equity component has been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
as a result  under canadian gaap  the amortization of the deferred costs is lower by  for the year ended december  recently issued accounting pronouncments canada and united states in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of interest rate exposure as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash  of which million consisted of short term investments and restricted cash 
a significant portion of the cash earns interest at variable rates 
in addition  although our short term investments are fixed rate instruments  the average term is short 
accordingly  our interest income is effectively sensitive to changes in the level of prevailing interest rates 
our convertible notes payable to related parties bear interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  we currently do not have any interest rate exposure on our indebtedness 
impact of foreign exchange rate exposure our functional currency is the us dollar  as we recognize the majority of our revenues in dollars 
in the foreseeable future  the majority of our non us dollar denominated expenses will be incurred in canadian dollars  euros  swiss francs and united kingdom pounds sterling 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the us dollar may result in currency gains and losses  which could affect our operating results 
we do not currently hedge against these currency fluctuations 
in the year ended december   we incurred realized and unrealized foreign currency losses relating to the translation of our non us dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of approximately
