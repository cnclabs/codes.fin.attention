item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction deltic timber corporation deltic or the company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber 
deltic owns approximately  acres of timberland  primarily in arkansas and north louisiana 
the company s sawmill operations are located at ola in central arkansas the ola mill and at waldo in south arkansas the waldo mill 
in addition to its timber and lumber operations  the company is engaged in real estate development in central arkansas 
the company also holds a percent interest in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard mdf 
deltic is a calendar year company for both financial and income tax reporting 
the company is organized into four segments woodlands  which manages the company s timberlands  mills  which consists of deltic s two sawmills that manufacture a variety of lumber products  real estate  which includes the company s real estate developments and a related country club operation  and corporate  which consists of executive management  planning  accounting  information systems  human resources  purchasing  treasury  income tax  and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units 
the company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units 
the company s timberlands consist primarily of southern pine  known in the industry as a type of softwood 
deltic considers its timberlands to be the company s most valuable asset and the harvest of stumpage to be its most significant source of income  accordingly  deltic actively manages its timberlands in order to increase productivity and maximize the long term value of these timber assets 
the company harvests timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans and sells such timber in the domestic market or converts it to lumber in its sawmills 
stumpage supplied to the company s sawmills is transferred at prices that approximate market 
the company implemented a timberland acquisition program in late  and this ongoing program has enabled the company  when desired  to increase harvest levels  while expanding its timber inventory 
thus far  the company has focused its acquisition program on timberland in its current operating area 
the company also initiated a program in to identify for possible sale non strategic timberland and higher and better use lands 
whenever possible  the company structures such sales to qualify as tax deferred like kind exchanges 
the company s two sawmills employ modern technology in order to improve efficiency  reduce labor costs  maximize utilization of the timber resource  and maintain high standards for production quality with safety being one of its highest priorities 
in addition  each mill is strategically located near significant portions of the timberlands 
the mills produce a variety of lumber products  including dimension lumber  boards  timbers  decking  and secondary manufacturing products  such as finger jointed studs 
these lumber products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors  lumber treaters  and truss manufacturers in the south and midwest and are used mainly in residential construction  roof trusses  and laminated beams 
the company s real estate operations were started in to add value to former timberland strategically located in the growth corridor of west little rock  arkansas 
since that time  the company has been developing chenal valley  a  acre upscale planned community 
the property is being developed in stages  and real estate sales to date have consisted primarily of residential lots  which are sold to builders or individuals  and commercial sites 
in addition to chenal valley  deltic has developed chenal downs  a acre development located just outside chenal valley  and red oak ridge  an acre development in hot springs  arkansas 
also  the company disclosed in plans for the ridges at nowlin creek  an upscale   acre  low impact residential development located just west of chenal valley  that will feature state of the art best management practices to protect water quality in response to its site adjacent to lake maumelle 
the del tin fiber plant is located near el dorado  arkansas 
construction of the plant was completed  and initial production began in the plant is designed to have a rated annual capacity of million 
table of contents square feet mmsf on a inch basis  making it one of the largest plants of its type in the world 
mdf  which is used primarily in the furniture  flooring  and molding industries  is manufactured from sawmill residuals such as chips  shavings  and sawdust  held together by an adhesive bond 
executive overview with the exception of its diversification in real estate development  deltic is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity based business environment 
this environment is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates  imports  foreign exchange rates  housing starts  residential repair and remodeling  commercial construction  industry capacity and production levels  the availability of raw material  and weather conditions 
robust housing starts in the us and canada  fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates  increased demand for softwood lumber products during this demand resulted in significant improvements in average lumber prices when compared to given its relative size and the nature of most commodity markets  the company has little or no control over pricing levels for its wood products 
therefore  the company will continually seek to wring controllable costs and expenses from its manufacturing process 
sales of real estate are affected by general economic conditions and interest rates  specifically as such factors are manifested in the company s operating area of central arkansas 
a strong housing market  helped by low interest rates and an improving economy  benefited the company s residential real estate sales activity during four significant accomplishments for the year of were deltic s mills segment achieved a dramatic recovery in its financial results through the substantial improvement in average lumber prices combined with record finished lumber production levels  the company s real estate operations had a record level of residential sales activity  closing lots during the year  del tin fiber significantly improved its operating and financial results culminating in the joint venture reporting its first profitable year of operation  and deltic lowered outstanding long term debt by just under million during the woodlands segment continued its trend of steady contributions to earnings during the current year 
for  pine sawtimber harvest prices were unchanged compared to  and the harvest volume decreased slightly from  tons to  tons 
however  the segment s operating profit was percent lower than  which benefited from higher sales of timberland including a choice  acre  higher and better use tract from deltic s  acre timberland holdings just west of the chenal valley real estate development 
deltic s average pine sawtimber prices have remained fairly stable over the past three years  despite a percent increase in the company s average finished lumber prices since the company s average pine sawtimber prices for  and were per ton  per ton and per ton  respectively  and deltic expects this trend in pricing levels to continue into over the long term  there is a fundamental correlation between the level of lumber prices and pine sawtimber prices 
however  in the short term  the geographical size differential between the lumber and pine sawtimber markets results in the two acting somewhat independently of each other 
pine sawtimber markets operate primarily within local or regional areas with sales being mainly to sawmills 
these mills are subject to a relatively fixed level of demand for raw materials that is driven by the facilities required production levels 
increases in pricing levels within the lumber market typically do not have a significant effect on the existing demand for raw materials in the short term  resulting in little impact to pine sawtimber prices 
this trend would typically also be true in the short term  during times of a suppressed lumber market 
ultimately  the company s ability to sell pine sawtimber at acceptable prices in the future will be dependent upon the size or existence of markets for manufactured lumber and other wood products 
the harvest level allows the company to manage its forests on a sustainable yield basis 
during  deltic increased the return requirements previously established for the sale of higher and better use and non strategic timberland  and accordingly  expects further reduction in timberland sales activity in timberland designated as higher and better use consists of tracts with market values that exceed the land s worth as a timber growing platform 
deltic s  acre timberland holdings in the expanding westward 
table of contents growth corridor of little rock  arkansas is an example of such land 
non strategic timberland is composed primarily of tracts too small to allow efficient timber management  those geographically isolated from other company fee lands  and acreage otherwise not deemed strategic to deltic s operations or growth 
prior to the current year  the company had identified several tracts of such acreage in the southwest portion of arkansas to sell  however  the active marketing of this land grouping was concluded during for the mills segment  the status of the lumber market and the resulting impact on the company s commodity softwood lumber products will continuously impact operating strategies and financial results 
the trade dispute between the us and canada remained unresolved throughout increases in canadian lumber imports were encountered in  as many canadian producers continued their increased production levels in efforts to reduce their per unit manufacturing costs 
however  this increasing supply of lumber was outpaced by consumer demand in  as us housing starts reached their highest level since this strong housing market  as well as  the growth in repair and remodeling activity continued to be driven by historically low mortgage interest rates and an overall strong us economy 
in addition  further upward pressure on us lumber prices arose from an inadequate supply of product transportation systems  which failed to meet the strong demand for wood products 
the resulting effect for deltic s sawmill operations in was an increase in average prices for lumber products to levels not realized since as with any commodity market  the company expects the historical volatility of lumber prices to continue in the future 
the company  along with other members of our industry  awaits the resolution of the us canadian softwood lumber trade dispute and knows that future pricing levels within the us lumber market are likely to be impacted by the outcome 
industry analysts are projecting the us housing market to continue its strong pace into  although a slowdown has been predicted for the second half of the year  predominately from a projected slight increase in mortgage interest rates 
since commodity based markets rarely benefit from real price growth  after inflation  deltic has concentrated management s attention  in regard to its manufacturing operations  on improving sales realizations through product and customer mix enhancements and improving production efficiencies and the cost structure at its lumber mills 
these production efficiency improvements are largely dependent upon increases in hourly production rates and mill uptime percentage 
for  the average sawmill production per hour at the company s two mills increased percent  while planermill production improved percent 
in an additional effort to further increase production levels at its ola mill  modifications were made in april which increased the operating hours structure at the facility 
sales activity levels for the company s real estate developments are affected by economic conditions that influence the level of housing starts in the central arkansas region  including general economic conditions and interest rates 
low mortgage interest rates in aided demand for residential lots in chenal valley  as evidenced by the company s lots sold in  which reduced available uncommitted inventory in this development to lots at the end of weather related construction delays prevented the company from offering for sale the lots planned for completion in chenal valley during the fourth quarter of however  construction of these lots was completed in january and offered for sale on january   with purchase commitments on of the lots offered  representing million in future revenue 
this indicates that demand for real estate within chenal valley remains strong 
the company expects this trend of strong demand to continue as deltic plans to develop another lots within chenal valley later in in deltic s other two active developments  red oak ridge and chenal downs  a total of lots were sold  leaving developed lots in red oak ridge and in chenal downs uncommitted as of year end while chenal downs is fully developed  deltic plans to develop an additional lots within red oak ridge in future annual lot development levels will be dependent upon the demand for the company s residential lots  which is expected to remain strong as long as interest rates remain at or near current levels 
during  the company disclosed plans for a  acre upscale residential development  the ridges at nowlin creek  on a portion of its large land holdings located west of chenal valley 
construction activity at this site is scheduled to begin in a portion of the development is located within the watershed of lake maumelle  a principal source of drinking water for little rock 
due to this environmentally sensitive locale  the company has determined to implement the most modern and proven best management practices to create a low impact development in order to protect water quality in the lake 
current activities include finalizing 
table of contents environmental and civil engineering features of the development and attempting to reach an accord with local utilities and government agencies that the development will be fully protective of water quality 
the local water utility continues to express its intention to acquire this watershed acreage  including by condemnation 
the average sales price for residential lots sold in of  decreased percent when compared to average price for a reporting period is largely dependent on the mix of lots sold in that period 
deltic s lot development plans provide for a mix of lot offerings that represent all real estate market segments for a planned community 
for example  neighborhoods adjoining chenal country club s new hole  championship golf course designed by robert trent jones  jr 
represent the highest market segment in the chenal valley development 
despite of the residential lots sold in being located in the first three neighborhoods adjoining the new golf course  compared to in  the average sales price for residential lots decreased due to increased sales of non golf course lots 
the mix of lot offerings for any given year will be driven by remaining lot availability and expected demand 
commercial real estate sales activity is by nature less predictable than residential activity 
with the number of residents in chenal valley  and other west little rock areas  growing steadily and momentum created from previous sales of commercial acreage in the development  interest in the company s remaining commercial acreage is increasing 
commercial sales only totaled acres in versus acres in  which consisted primarily of acres to wal mart stores  inc  acres to a group of private investors for retail development  and acres for the construction of a multi family housing complex 
as of december   about acres  or percent of the acres of property currently zoned as commercial in chenal valley was available for sale in future periods 
no commercial acreage is included in the chenal downs or the ridges at nowlin creek developments 
red oak ridge is planned to include approximately acres of commercial property 
the company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites as this development s population density increases 
on april   red development llc announced plans for the promenade at chenal  a acre  open air  lifestyle shopping center 
the sales contract regarding this site remains in its feasibility period  and originally was scheduled to close before the end of however  as is the inherent unpredictable nature of commercial real estate sales  the initial contract has been extended and is now scheduled to close in some extensions of similar contracts in the past have been followed by the termination of the commercial sale 
in addition  the real estate segment completed the sale of acres of undeveloped real estate property within chenal valley in  resulting in a pretax gain of million 
unlike residential lots and commercial acres  undeveloped real estate property is not directly marketed by the company  and sales of such property have been historically sporadic in nature and are usually initiated by inquiry from a potential purchaser 
operating results for del tin fiber are affected primarily by the overall mdf market and plant operating performance 
china s mdf industry continues to grow rapidly as the country ended representing almost one third of global capacity 
in addition  segments of the us furniture manufacturing industry have relocated to the far east  furniture manufacturers being a primary purchaser of mdf 
these trends  combined with continued north american mdf production  resulted in the us mdf market being oversupplied until the latter portion of however  with the continued strong levels of housing starts and repair and remodeling activity in the us  mdf consumption grew three and a half percent in  and industry analysts project a continued upward trend in growth rates over the next five years 
the level of imports has continued to grow steadily  but the weakening us dollar might prove to be the most effective means of slowing down further increases in most producers in the industry need sustained high pricing levels  in addition to manufacturing cost reductions  to remain profitable 
the predicted increases in consumption should strengthen the market unless import levels surge 
operationally  del tin fiber continued to make significant advances during the plant s management remained focused on raising the plant s uptime percentage to be in line with the industry average and improving the plant s cost structure 
in addition  the facility continued its improvements in the percentage of production of premium grade product  which increased sales realizations 
change in the product mix at the plant also positively impacted average sales prices  as the percentage of thin board was further increased due to improvements in the plant s operating performance 
in addition  improvements to the plant s raw material mix were implemented and the plant improved productivity levels 
these improved operating activities  combined with the favorable mdf market  allowed the joint venture to report its first ever profitable year of operations in future efforts are being concentrated on further improving productivity levels and 
table of contents plant efficiencies and making additional reductions in the plant s manufacturing cost per thousand square feet msf 
unfortunately  continued advancements at the joint venture were slowed as deltic announced on january   that production activities at del tin fiber would be temporarily curtailed due to damage sustained at the facility from a fire within the plant 
the fire damaged the facility s fiber storage and handling systems 
neither the refiner systems nor continuous press were involved or damaged and no injuries were experienced 
repair of the damaged units was commenced immediately  and the plant resumed production on february  significant events from the time production began at del tin fiber in until the fourth quarter of  both operating and financial performance were below the expectations established at the time that the decision to construct the plant was made 
as a result  on april   deltic announced that banc one capital markets  inc had been retained as financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the company s investment in del tin fiber 
subsequently  deltic s management and board of directors completed its review of these strategic alternatives and announced the company intended to exit the mdf business upon the earliest  reasonable opportunity provided by the market 
as a result of this decision  the company s evaluation of possible impairment of the carrying value of its investment in the joint venture was based primarily upon the estimated cash flows from a sale of the company s interest during and resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december  the investment was written off  to zero  and the write off amounted to million before income taxes 
due to the company s commitment to fund its share of any of the facility s operating working capital needs until the facility was able to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements or deltic s ownership was sold  the company recognized equity in del tin fiber equal to the extent of these advances during for the year of  such advances approximated the company s equity share of losses for the plant  accordingly  the investment in del tin fiber at december   was zero 
the company also continued to utilize its management resources to work with del tin s management and the joint venture partner to improve operating performance at the plant 
as a result of these improvements  on december   deltic s board of directors revised its intent regarding the company s investment in del tin fiber and ceased efforts to sell the company s interest in the joint venture  while continuing to focus on improving operating and financial results of the plant 
due to this decision  the evaluation of fair value for the investment was based primarily upon the future net cash flows from del tin fiber s operations over the remaining life of the plant 
the estimated fair value from this evaluation indicated that no impairment existed as of december  in  the company recorded its equity share of the operating results of the joint venture 
on august   del tin fiber successfully refinanced its existing long term debt by entering into a credit agreement consisting of a letter of credit and term loan with multiple lending institutions pursuant to which  million of its million industrial revenue bonds were redeemed 
under the new credit agreement  the lenders  on september   loaned del tin fiber million  which will be repayable over five years in equal quarterly installments  beginning december   and issued on del tin fiber s behalf  a letter of credit in the amount of million to support the remaining industrial revenue bonds originally issued in by union county  arkansas 
this refinancing resulted in more favorable credit terms for the joint venture  the most notable of which was the removal of the remaining required bond sinking fund payments of million due in under the prior debt facility 
for additional information about the company s investment in del tin fiber  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   deltic redeemed the  outstanding shares of its percent redeemable preferred stock 
this was primarily effected by utilizing proceeds from the company s issuance of million of privately placed  long term senior notes on december  these notes bear interest at a fixed stated rate of percent 
this redemption has produced an after tax savings and reduced net cash

other matters impact of inflation general inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results during the three years ended december  the company s timber operations are more significantly impacted by the forces of supply and demand in the southern united states than by changes in inflation 
lumber manufacturing operations are affected by the supply of lumber available in the north american market and by the demand for lumber by both the north american and foreign export markets 
sales of real estate are affected by changes in the general economy and long term interest rates  specifically as such may manifest themselves in the central arkansas region 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments  either derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
the company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies  however  deltic does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial 
table of contents instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s funds held by trustee  long term debt  including current maturities  contractual guarantees of debt  and letters of credit at december   were zero  million  million  and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt of million and contractual guarantees of debt of 
million  while the fair value of the company s funds held by trustee and letters of credit would be unchanged 
fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
the estimated pretax earnings and cash flows impact for resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately 
million  holding other variables constant 
foreign exchange rate risk the company currently has no exposure to foreign exchange rate risk because all of its financial instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk the company has no financial instruments subject to commodity price risk

critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified six of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  five of these policies require significant assumptions and or estimates on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee  and deltic has not made any material changes to its critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
these policies  along with explanations of the key assumptions and or estimates considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs  including amenities 
indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis  while indirect costs for the company s four development areas chenal valley  chenal downs  red oak ridge  and the ridges at nowlin creek are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf course at chenal country club  the amenity 
table of contents around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  are charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
in determining future indirect development costs  management relies on cost projections for its development plans provided by independent  professional engineering consultants 
independent appraisers are utilized to provide the potential market value for unsold acreage 
investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is carried at cost and is adjusted for the company s proportionate share of del tin fiber s undistributed earnings or losses 
the company s equity method basis carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as applicable under the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this evaluation as of december   based on the intent of the company s board of directors to exit the business  resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated balance sheet 
on december   the company s board of directors revised its intent in regard to selling deltic s interest in the joint venture 
the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value  which was zero as of december   and the company resumed recording its equity share of the operating results of del tin fiber 
likewise  cash advances to the joint venture are recorded as increases in the company s investment in the facility  while cash distributions received from the joint venture are reflected as reductions in its investment 
for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners  the factors used in evaluating the impairment of the investment s carrying value  and the estimate of the fair value of the company s guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period 
in evaluating the possibility of the existence of an impairment for the company s carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber under apb  management must estimate future net cash flows from the possible courses of action available for its investment  such as continuing to maintain or sell its investment  to determine both recoverability of the carrying amount and fair value of the investment 
more specifically  management must determine the possible courses of action and estimate the probability of each potential action  as well as the related future net cash flows 
then  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  management must determine if this impairment is other than temporary 
if so  then an impairment write down is required 
in estimating the fair value of the guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement  deltic s management must first assess how the same debt instrument would have been structured without the guarantees of the joint venture partners  in order to estimate the premium resulting from deltic s guarantee 
a range of probabilities of estimated future cash outflows under the premium previously determined are then assembled 
a probability weighted present value of the estimated future cash outflows is then calculated 
the resulting balance represents the fair value of the obligation  which is the estimate of the value of assets required currently to settle the liability in the future

timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities  is stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities 
the cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company s professional foresters estimate its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of timber and timberland purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized 
fee timber carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of fee timber harvested expense reported 
per ton costs for ranged from to per ton for pine sawtimber 
had the company opted to use a composite depletion rate  cost of pine sawtimber harvested would have been 
million more in  million more in  and million less in 
million  million  
million  respectively  net of applicable income taxes than as reported due to the mix of harvest by company during the year 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of fee timber harvested recognized is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation 
for additional information about the company s timber and timberlands  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
management has also evaluated any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate an impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying values would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations

stock based compensation at december   deltic had two stock based compensation plans for which the company applies the recognition and measurement principles of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for those plans 
stock based employee compensation expense is accrued for the intrinsic value  if any  of stock options or restricted stock granted over the applicable vesting periods using the straight line method 
options granted by the company have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as of november  the company eliminated certain option exercise procedures  resulting in a change to fixed plan accounting treatment for all options 
prior to that date  the company was required to apply variable plan accounting standards which required adjustment of the cost of options granted for changes in the market value per share of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company has awarded restricted stock awards to selected employees 
the vesting of these awards are subject to either time restrictions  applying fixed plan accounting standards  or performance restrictions  applying variable plan accounting standards 
for additional information  see note incentive plans 
the effect on net income loss and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  for the years ended december consisted of the following thousands of dollars  except per share amounts net income loss  as reported plus total stock based compensation expense determined under the intrinsic value method for awards  net of related tax effects  included in the determination of net income less pro forma total stock based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income loss basic earnings per share as reported pro forma dilutive earnings per share as reported pro forma for the pro forma net income calculation in the preceding table  the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions for awards in   and  respectively dividend yields of 
percent  percent  and percent  expected volatility of percent  percent  and percent  risk free interest rates of percent  percent  and percent  and expected lives of five years 
using these assumptions  the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted in   and was   and  respectively 
the key management decision factors for stock based compensation are the decision  prior 
table of contents to  to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  or the fair value recognition and measurement principles of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stocked based compensation transition and disclosure  and the determination of the exercise price for options granted 
as of december   a company s management could elect to adopt sfas or continue to use apb for recognizing stock option expense in its financial statements 
if continued use of apb was elected  the income statement generally reflected a lesser amount for stock based compensation expense  and the potential impact of adopting sfas and sfas would only be disclosed on a pro forma basis in the financial statement footnotes 
under the company s stock incentive plan  option exercise price for options granted was equal to the fair market per share stock price on the date of the grant  which resulted in no stock based compensation expense for future options granted under the company s stock incentive plan 
however  options granted in february were subject to shareholder approval at the company s annual stockholders meeting on april   the accounting measurement date for these options 
as a result  these options had an intrinsic value of per share due to an increase in the market price of the company s common stock between february and april  and the resulting stock based compensation expense is being recognized over the vesting periods of these options 
in  the company will adopt the provisions of sfas revised  share based payment 
this standard requires the company to expense the fair market value of all stock based compensation  eliminating the first key management decision factor discussed above
