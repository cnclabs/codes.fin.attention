item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a holding company organized under the laws of the cayman islands with our principal executive office in bermuda 
we are a reinsurer of life insurance  annuities and annuity type products 
these products are written by life insurance companies and other financial institutions located principally in the united states  as well as around the world 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance north america 
scottish re holdings limited and its subsidiary  scottish re limited  specialize in niche markets in developed countries and broader life insurance markets in the developing world 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance international 
life reinsurance north america and life reinsurance international are each a reporting operating segment 
to a lesser extent  we directly issue variable life insurance and variable annuities and similar products to high net worth individuals and families for insurance  investment and estate planning purposes 
in prior years  we referred to this portion of our business as wealth management  which was another reportable operating segment 
as this business is no longer a material contributor to our results  we have combined it with the other segment for all periods presented 
other revenues and expenses not related to life reinsurance are reported in the other segment 
on december   we completed the acquisition of the individual life reinsurance business of ing 
we have reinsured the liabilities of all of ing s individual life reinsurance business through a coinsurance transaction 
ing transferred to us assets of approximately billion 
the assets transferred are subject to certain post closing adjustments 
certain of these assets will be held in trust to secure the reserve obligations of the business 
additionally  ing transferred certain operating assets associated with the business 
in addition to the assets transferred by ing  we have raised an additional million in new capital  which will be used to satisfy the capital requirements for the acquired business 
this new capital includes equity of million provided by the cypress group  a private equity firm  and an additional million in capital raised through the issuance by one of our subsidiaries of trust preferred securities guaranteed by scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
in a private transaction to institutional investors 
on december   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of scottish re life corporation formally erc life reinsurance corporation  for million in cash 
on february  erc life corporation s name was changed to scottish re life corporation 
scottish re life corporation was a subsidiary of general electric s employers reinsurance corporation  which we call ge erc  and was one of the companies through which ge erc conducted life reinsurance business in the united states 
scottish re life corporation s business consists primarily of a closed block of traditional life reinsurance 
no ge erc employees were transferred to scottish re 
ge erc agreed to administer the business of scottish re life corporation for a fixed monthly fee for up to nine months from the date of acquisition and to assist with the transition of the business to scottish re s systems 
this transition period has now been completed 
all amounts are reported in thousands of united states dollars  except per share amounts 
revenues we derive revenue from three principal sources o premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business  o investment income from our investment portfolio  and o realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business are included in revenues over the premium paying period of the underlying policies 
when we acquire blocks of in force business  we account for these transactions as purchases  and our results of operations include the net income from these blocks as of their respective dates of acquisition 
reinsurance assumed on annuity business does not generate premium income but generates investment income over time on the assets we receive from the ceding company 
we also earn fees in our financial reinsurance transactions with us insurance company clients 
because some of these transactions do not satisfy the risk transfer rules for reinsurance accounting  the premiums and benefits are not reported in the consolidated statements of income 
a deposit received on a funding agreement also does not generate premium income but does create income to the extent we earn an investment return in excess of our interest payment obligations thereon 
our investment income includes interest earned on our fixed income investments and income from funds withheld at interest under modified coinsurance agreements 
under gaap  because our fixed income investments are held as available for sale  these securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on these securities is not included in investment income on our statements of income  but is included in comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses include gains and losses on investment securities that we sell during a period  write downs of securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
expenses we have five principal types of expenses o claims and policy benefits under our reinsurance contracts  o interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities  o acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  o operating expenses  and o interest expense 
when we issue a life reinsurance contract  we establish reserves for future benefits 
these reserves are our estimates of what we expect to pay in claims and policy benefits and related expenses under the contract or policy 
from time to time  we may change the reserves if our experience leads us to believe that benefit claims and expenses will ultimately be greater than the existing reserve 
we report the change in these reserves as an expense during the period when the reserve or additional reserve is established 
in connection with reinsurance of annuity and annuity type products  we record a liability for interest sensitive contract liabilities  which represents the amount ultimately due to the policyholder 
we credit interest to these contracts each period at the rates determined in the underlying contract  and the amount is reported as interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities on our consolidated statements of income 
a portion of the costs of acquiring new business  such as commissions  certain internal expenses related to our policy issuance and underwriting departments and some variable selling expenses are capitalized 
the resulting deferred acquisition costs asset is amortized over future periods based on our expectations as to the emergence of future gross profits from the underlying contracts 
these costs are dependent on the structure  size and type of business written 
for certain products  we may retrospectively adjust our amortization when we revise our estimate of current or future gross profits to be realized 
the effects of this adjustment are reflected in earnings in the period in which we revise our estimate 
acquisition costs also include collateral financing and letter of credit costs 
operating expenses consist of salary and salary related expenses  legal and professional fees  rent and office expenses  travel and entertainment  directors expenses  insurance and other similar expenses  except to the extent capitalized in deferred acquisition costs 
interest expense consists of interest charges on our borrowings 
factors affecting profitability we seek to generate profits from two principal sources 
first  in our life reinsurance business  we seek to receive reinsurance premiums and financial reinsurance fees that  together with income from the assets in which those premiums are invested  exceed the amounts we ultimately pay as claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
second  within our investment guidelines  we seek to maximize the return on our unallocated capital 
the following factors affect our profitability o the volume of business we write  o our ability to assess and price adequately for the risks we assume  o the mix of different types of business that we reinsure  because profits on some kinds of business emerge later than on other types  o our ability to manage our assets and liabilities to manage investment and liquidity risk  and o our ability to control expenses 
in addition  our profits can be affected by a number of factors that are not within our control 
for example  movements in interest rates can affect the volume of business that we write  the income earned from our investments  the interest we credit on interest sensitive contracts  the level of surrender activity on contracts that we reinsure and the rate at which we amortize deferred acquisition costs 
other external factors that can affect profitability include mortality experience that varies from our assumed mortality  changes in regulation or tax laws which may affect the attractiveness of our products or the costs of doing business and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises applies to our traditional life policies with continuing premiums 
for these policies  future benefits are estimated using a net level premium method on the basis of actuarial assumptions as to mortality  persistency and interest established at policy issue 
assumptions established at policy issue as to mortality and persistency are based on anticipated experience  which  together with interest and expense assumptions  provide a margin for adverse deviation 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense in a constant percentage of the gross premiums using these assumptions established at issue 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments applies to investment contracts  limited premium contracts  and universal life type contracts 
for investment and universal life type contracts  future benefit liabilities are held using the retrospective deposit method  increased for amounts representing unearned revenue or refundable policy charges 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as a constant percentage of gross margins using assumptions as to mortality  persistency  and expense established at policy issue without provision for adverse deviation and are revised periodically to reflect emerging actual experience and any material changes in expected future experience 
liabilities and the deferral of acquisition costs are established for limited premium policies under the same practices as used for traditional life policies with the exception that any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recognized into income as a constant percentage of insurance in force 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency  maintenance expense and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
our premiums earned are recorded generally in accordance with information received from our ceding companies  or are estimated where this information is not current with the reporting period 
these premium estimates are based on historical experience as adjusted for current treaty terms and other information 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management monitors actual experience  and should circumstances warrant  will revise its estimates of premiums earned 
the development of policy reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our products requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse  expense and investment experience 
such estimates are primarily based on historical experience and information provided by ceding companies 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management monitors actual experience  and should circumstances warrant  will revise its assumptions and the related reserve estimates 
in the normal course of business  we acquire in force blocks of business 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse rates and expenses 
these estimates are based on historical experience  actuarial studies and information provided by the ceding companies 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
present value of in force business is established upon the acquisition of a subsidiary and is amortized over the expected life of the business at the time of acquisition 
the amortization each year will be a function of the gross profits or revenues each year in relation to the total gross profits or revenues expected over the life of business  discounted at the assumed net credit rate 
the determination of the initial value and the subsequent amortization require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future business results that could differ materially from actual results 
estimates and assumptions involved in the present value of in force business and subsequent amortization are similar to those necessary in the establishment of reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
goodwill is established upon the acquisition of a subsidiary 
goodwill is calculated as the difference between the price paid and the value of individual assets and liabilities on the date of acquisition 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill deemed to have an indefinite life is subject to an annual impairment test 
goodwill recognized in the consolidated balance sheet relates to our acquisition of scottish re holdings limited and has been tested for impairment 
we have determined that there is no impairment 
fixed maturity investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairments in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas and emerging issues task force recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized assets eitf as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under these pronouncements  realized losses are recognized on securities if the securities are determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
factors involved in the determination of potential impairment include fair value as compared to amortized cost  length of time the value has been below amortized cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
our funds withheld at interest arise on modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance transactions 
derivatives implementation group issue no 
b embedded derivatives bifurcation of a debt instrument that incorporates both interest rate and credit rate risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument dig b indicates that these transactions contain embedded derivatives 
the embedded derivative feature in our funds withheld treaties is similar to a fixed rate total return swap on the assets held by the ceding companies 
the swap consists of two parts 
the first is the market value of the underlying asset portfolio and the second is a hypothetical loan to the ceding company 
the hypothetical loan is based on the expected cash flows of the underlying reinsurance liability 
we have developed models to systematically estimate the value of the total return swap 
the fair value of the embedded derivative is affected by changes in expected cash flows  credit spreads of the assets and changes in risk free interest rates 
the change in fair value is included in our calculation of estimated gross profits and  therefore  also affects the amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
in addition to our quota share indemnity funds withheld contracts  we have entered into various financial reinsurance treaties that  although considered funds withheld  do not transfer significant insurance risk and are recorded on a deposit method of accounting 
as a result of the experience refund provisions of these treaties the value of the embedded derivative is currently considered immaterial 
changes in our expectations of future cash flows could result in material changes to the financial statements 
our accounting policies addressing premiums earned  reserves  deferred acquisition costs  value of business acquired  goodwill  investment impairment and embedded derivatives involve significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
changes in these assumptions  judgments and estimates could create material changes in our consolidated financial statements

the increase in fee income arises principally from our acquisition of scottish re life corporation 
the increase in investment income is due to growth in our invested assets  which arises from business growth and acquisition  our offering of ordinary shares in july and our hycu offering in the fourth quarter of and trust preferred debt offerings in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of growth in these areas has been offset by realized losses and a decrease in the change in value of embedded derivatives

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires bifurcation of a debt instrument into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument 
under dig b modified coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld reinsurance agreements where interest is determined by reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets  are arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
in addition  reinsurance contacts with experience refunds are also considered to be arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
dig b was effective for fiscal quarters beginning october  we reviewed all contracts at october  and determined that the value of this derivative  net of related deferred acquisition costs  after taxation was a loss of million 
this is shown in the consolidated statements of income as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december  the change in value of the derivative  net of related deferred amortization costs  during the year ended december  amounted to a gain of million 
in the quarter and year ended december   the change in value of this derivative amounted to a gain of million 
the change in value is primarily due to movements in risk free interest rates

management reviews securities with material unrealized losses and tests for other than temporary impairments on a quarterly basis 
factors involved in the determination of impairment include fair value as compared to amortized cost  length of time the value has been below amortized cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
we review all investments with fair values less than amortized cost  and pay particular attention to those that have traded continuously at less than of amortized cost for at least six months or of amortized cost for at least months and other assets with material differences between amortized cost and fair value 
investments meeting those criteria are analyzed in detail for other than temporary impairment 
when a decline is considered to be other than temporary a realized loss is incurred and the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value 
under eitf  a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis is considered to be an other than temporary impairment whenever there is an adverse change in the amount or timing of cash flow to be received  regardless of the resulting yield  unless the decrease is solely a result of changes in market interest rates

as a result  approximately million of current tax expense and a corresponding million of deferred tax benefit is not reflected in the income statement consistent with purchase accounting principles

the increase in the number of securities with unrealized losses is primarily attributable to increases in interest rates

funds withheld at interest funds withheld at interest arise on contracts written under modified coinsurance agreements and funds withheld coinsurance agreements 
in substance  these agreements are identical to coinsurance treaties except that the ceding company retains control of and title to the assets 
the deposits paid to the ceding company by the underlying policyholders are held in a segregated portfolio and managed by the ceding company or by investment managers appointed by the ceding company 
these treaties transfer a quota share of the risks 
the funds withheld at interest represent our share of the ceding companies statutory reserves 
the cash flows exchanged with each monthly settlement are netted and include  among other items  our quota share of investment income on our proportionate share of the portfolio  realized losses  realized gains amortized to reflect the statutory rules relating to interest maintenance reserve  interest credited and expense allowances 
at december   funds withheld at interest were in respect of seven contracts with four ceding companies 
at december   funds withheld at interest were in respect of six contracts with three ceding companies 
at december   we had three contracts with lincoln national insurance company that accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances 
additionally we had two contracts with security life of denver international that accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances 
the remaining contracts were with illinois mutual insurance company and american founders life insurance company 
lincoln national insurance company has financial strength ratings of a from am best  aa from standard poor s  aa from moody s and aa from fitch 
in the event of insolvency of the ceding companies on these arrangements we would need to exert a claim on the assets supporting the contract liabilities 
however  the risk of loss is mitigated by our ability to offset amounts owed to the ceding company with the amounts owed to us by the ceding company 
reserves for future policy benefits and interest sensitive contract liabilities relating to these contracts amounted to billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
at december   the funds withheld at interest totaled billion with an average rating of a  an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of as compared with an average rating of a  an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of at december  these are fixed income investments and include marketable securities  commercial mortgages  private placements and cash 
the market value of the funds withheld amounted to billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
the investment objectives for these arrangements are included in the agreements 
the primary objective is to maximize current income  consistent with the long term preservation of capital 
the overall investment strategy is executed within the context of prudent asset liability management 
the investment guidelines permit investments in fixed maturity securities  and include marketable securities  commercial mortgages  private placements and cash 
the maximum percentage of below investment grade securities is and other guidelines limit risk  ensure issuer and industry diversification as well as maintain liquidity and overall portfolio credit quality

in periods of growth of new business our operating cash flow may decrease due to first year commissions paid on new business generated 
for income recognition purposes these commissions are deferred and amortized over the life of the business 
the decrease in operating cash flow is partly attributable to settlement of a tax liability of approximately million 
this liability resulted from actions taken by the former owner of scottish re life corporation immediately prior to its acquisition in december when adjusted for this payment  cash inflows from operations in the year ended december  were million compared to inflows million in this decrease is due to the timing of receipt of reinsurance receivables and settlement of reinsurance payables 
during the year ended december  we settled reinsurance payables outstanding at december cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in in comparison with cash flow of million used in operating activities in the increase in operating cash flow from was million 
it related primarily to increases in premiums  fees  and investment income being greater than increases in benefits  reserve movements and expenses paid 
cash from premiums and fees increased by million due to growth in our life reinsurance business 
cash from investment income increased by million due to the growth in our invested asset base 
the increase was offset by declining yields 
cash used to settle benefits increased by million due to the growth in our life reinsurance business 
this use of cash was offset by an increase in related reserves of million 
cash used to pay acquisition and other expenses  including commissions and interest  increased by million 
this increase related principally to new business written in our life reinsurance north america segment  increased operating expenses and increased debt 
acquisition costs include commissions on first year business that are deferred when paid and therefore do not impact net income until later years 
we believe cash flows from operations will be positive over time 
however  they may be positive or negative in any one period depending on the amount of new life reinsurance business written  the level of ceding commissions paid in connection with writing that business  the level of renewal premiums earned in the period and the timing of receipt of reinsurance receivables and settlement of reinsurance payables 
to address the risk that operating cash flows may not be sufficient in any given period we maintain a high quality  fixed maturity portfolio with positive liquidity characteristics 
these securities are available for sale and can be sold to meet obligations if necessary

total capitalization is analyzed as follows december  december  december  dollars in thousands shareholders equity    mezzanine equity   long term debt    convertible junior subordinated notes 
 the increase in capitalization is due to the net income for the year ended december  of million  the issuance of ordinary shares  warrants and notes to the cypress entities  totaling million  the issuance of trust preferred debt of million  the issuance of share capital to employees on the exercise of options of million and an increase in other comprehensive income of million offset by dividends paid of million 
other comprehensive income consists of the unrealized appreciation on investments and the cumulative translation adjustment arising from the translation of scottish re holdings limited s balance sheet at exchange rates as of december  the million increase in capitalization in is due primarily to the net proceeds of our equity offering of million  the net proceeds of the offering of hycus which are included in mezzanine equity of million  the trust preferred securities offerings of million  net income for the year of million and increases in other comprehensive income 
these increases have been offset by dividends paid of million

in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin provides a framework for identifying variable interest entities and determining when a company should include its assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of activities in the consolidated financial statements 
a variable interest entity is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support  has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if a party with an ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the variable interest entity is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns  or both 
a variable interest holder that consolidates the variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary 
we are the primary beneficiary of the collateral finance facility discussed in note and thus have consolidated the variable interest entity in accordance with fin during the quarter ended september   eitf the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share was issued 
eitf requires that certain instruments with embedded conversion features that are contingent upon market price triggers be included in diluted earnings per share calculations regardless of whether the contingency has been met 
our senior convertible notes are convertible on the basis of a market price trigger 
on october  we amended the terms of these notes so that we are required to settle the principal amount of million in cash on conversion or repurchase 
as a result we shall continue to apply the treasury stock method in calculating diluted earnings per share for amounts in excess of the principal of million

these risks and uncertainties include o uncertainties relating to the ratings accorded to our insurance subsidiaries  o the risk that our risk analysis and underwriting may be inadequate  o exposure to mortality experience which differs from our assumptions  o risks arising from our investment strategy  including risks related to the market value of our investments  fluctuations in interest rates and our need for liquidity  o uncertainties arising from control of our invested assets by third parties  o developments in global financial markets that could affect our investment portfolio and fee income  o changes in the rate of policyholder withdrawals or recapture of reinsurance treaties  o the risk that our retrocessionaires may not honor their obligations to us  o terrorist attacks on the united states and the impact of such attacks on the economy in general and on our business in particular  o political and economic risks in developing countries  o the impact of acquisitions  including the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses  the competing demands for our capital and the risk of undisclosed liabilities  o the risk that we do not receive shareholder approval for new shares to be issued to the cypress group  o loss of the services of any of our key employees  o losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  o uncertainties relating to government and regulatory policies such as subjecting us to insurance regulation or taxation in additional jurisdictions  o the competitive environment in which we operate and associated pricing pressures  and o changes in accounting principles

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we measure and manage market risks and other risks as part of an enterprise wide risk management process 
the market risks described in this section relate to financial instruments  primarily in our investment portfolio  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  credit risk premiums or spreads  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
our investments  which are primarily fixed income securities  are subject to market value  reinvestment  and liquidity risk 
our invested assets are funded not only by capital but also by the proceeds of reinsurance transactions  some of which entail substantial deposits of funds or assets 
the cash flows required to pay future benefits are subject to actuarial uncertainties and  in some cases  the policies that we reinsure contain provisions that tend to increase benefits to customers depending on movements in interest rates 
we analyze the potential results of a transaction  including the cash flows of the liabilities and of the related assets  and any risk mitigation measures  and we price transactions to cover our costs  including estimated credit losses  and earn a desirable risk adjusted return under various scenarios 
we use interest rate swaps as tools to mitigate these risks 
we may also retrocede some risks to other reinsurers 
interest rate risk interest rate risk consists of two components in a falling rate scenario  we have reinvestment risk  which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities  and in a rising rate scenario  we have the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will then be trading at depreciated values 
with some annuity liabilities  these risks are compounded by variability in liability cash flows arising from adverse experience in withdrawals  surrenders  mortality  and election of early retirement 
we mitigate both components of risk through asset liability management  including the technique of simulating future results under a variety of interest rate scenarios and modifying the investment and hedging strategy to mitigate downside risk to earnings 
our investment portfolio is composed of fixed maturity bond investments  of which the majority are at fixed interest rates 
for fixed rate investments backing reinsurance liabilities  the maturity structure has been designed to have approximately the same exposure to changes in interest rates as the related liabilities 
floating rate liabilities  including borrowings  are backed primarily by floating rate assets 
in the capital account  however  we own investments that are also sensitive to interest rate changes and this sensitivity is not offset by liabilities 
our overall objective is to limit interest rate exposure 
credit risk credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest 
we measure and manage credit risk not only of bond issuers but also of counter parties in reinsurance  retrocession and hedging transactions 
in our investment portfolio  credit risk is manifested in three ways o actual and anticipated deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issue  as may be reflected in downgrades in its ratings  tend to reduce its market value  o our managers might react to the actual or expected deterioration and or downgrade of an issuer by selling some or all of our positions  realizing a loss or a profit smaller than would have been realized if the deterioration or downgrade had not occurred  and o the issuer may go into default  ultimately causing us to realize a loss 
one of our key objectives in managing credit risk is to keep actual credit losses below both the amounts that we have assumed and allowed for in pricing reinsurance transactions and the amounts we would have lost  given the general level of experience for comparably rated securities of the same type in the general market 
we seek to prevent credit risk  in the aggregate  from becoming the dominant source of risk in our overall book of retained risks as a reinsurer 
we mitigate credit risk by adopting an investment policy  approved by our board of directors  which limits overall exposure to credit risk and requires diversification by limiting exposure to any single issuer 
we also use outside professional money management firms and monitor their capabilities  performance and compliance with our investment and risk management policies 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  our uk subsidiaries  scottish re holdings limited and scottish re limited  maintain operating expense accounts in british pounds  parts of their investment portfolios in euros and british pounds  and receive other currencies in payment of premiums 
all of scottish re limited s original us business is settled in united states dollars  all canadian  latin american and certain asia and middle east business is converted and settled in united states dollars  and all other currencies are converted and settled in euros or british pounds 
the results of the business recorded in euros and in british pounds are then translated to united states dollars 
scottish re attempts to limit substantial exposures to foreign currency risk  but does not actively manage currency risks 
to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  we may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may enter into investment  insurance and reinsurance transactions in the future in currencies other than united states dollars 
our objective is to avoid substantial exposures to foreign currency risk 
we will manage these risks using policy limits  asset liability management techniques and hedging transactions 
sensitivity analysis change in interest rates we regularly conduct analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rates on our financial condition 
techniques include  but are not limited to  comparison of option adjusted duration of assets and liabilities and simulation of future asset and liability cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios 
financial simulations are also used to evaluate exposure to credit spreads and will be used as we consider investments and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
on a monthly basis  we measure the gap between the effective duration of the investments and the target duration 
for assets supporting liabilities  we set the target duration to minimize interest rate risk for each liability transaction 
our investment policy limits the duration gap to years 
for floating rate borrowings and liabilities  we target floating rate assets  which have a duration near zero 
for capital account assets  we target a duration of years 
quantitative disclosure of interest rate risk the following tables provide information as of december  about the interest rate sensitivity of the portion of our investment portfolio managed by external managers 
the tables do not include other cash balances of million  or modified coinsurance assets of billion 
the tables show the aggregate amount  by book value and fair value  of the securities that are expected to mature in each of the next five years and thereafter  as well as the weighted average book yield of those securities 
the expected maturity is the weighted average life of a security and takes into consideration par amortization for mortgage backed securities  call features and sinking fund features 
in addition to the maturity structure of our controlled asset portfolio illustrated below  scottish re has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and a maturity of july this swap is used to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure on the balance sheet and has the effect of shortening the duration on our overall controlled portfolio by years or approximately equivalent to reducing our five year maturity exposure by million
