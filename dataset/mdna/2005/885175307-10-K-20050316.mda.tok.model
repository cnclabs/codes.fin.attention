the forward looking statements included in this form k are made only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of circulatory support products for use by patients with congestive heart failure  or chf 
our vads are used primarily by these chf patients to perform some or all of the pumping function of the 
table of contents heart and we currently offer the widest range of products to serve this market 
we believe that our long standing reputation for quality and innovation and our excellent relationships with leading cardiovascular surgeons worldwide position us to capture growth opportunities in the expanding congestive heart failure market 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  itc  we design  develop  manufacture and market point of care diagnostic test systems that provide fast  accurate blood test results to improve patient management  reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
our business is comprised of two segments  cardiovascular and itc 
the major product lines within the cardiovascular segment are circulatory support products 
our circulatory support products include vads for the short term and long term treatment of congestive heart failure 
vascular graft products 
we have developed small diameter grafts using our proprietary materials to address the vascular access market 
our grafts are sold in the united states and internationally for use in hemodialysis 
the major product line of our itc segment is point of care diagnostics 
we are a leading supplier of point of care blood diagnostics test systems that provide fast  accurate blood test results to improve patient management  reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
growth in out itc segment assumes increased patient testing  better patient outcomes  and increased decentralization of testing from central laboratories to point of care 
our business model the two product lines that represent the majority of our product sales are vad and point of care diagnostic test systems and services 
historical product sales mix has been as follows cardiovasular vad pumps including associated products and services grafts point of care diagnostic test systems product sales acquisitions and strategic investments on march   we made an investment in biocardia  inc under the terms of the investment documents  we i will assist biocardia in exploring opportunities for developing devices for the surgical delivery of biotherapeutics  ii have limited exclusive rights to negotiate the distribution  licensing or purchase of surgical delivery technology developed by biocardia and iii through an observational board seat  subject to biocardia s authorization will be able to review relevant clinical data accumulated by biocardia through its multiple trials 
we have accounted for this investment on the cost basis as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over biocardia s operating and financial policies 
this investment is included on our consolidated balance sheet in other long term assets 
on september   we completed an asset purchase of the immediate response mobile analysis  or irma  point of care blood analysis system product line from diametrics medical  inc we paid approximately million in cash and assumed trade payables 
the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of assets acquired as determined by an independent valuation firm 
there was no goodwill recorded with the transaction 
as a result of the acquisition   relating to in process research and development was expensed in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents restructuring plan in june  following the merger with tca  we initiated a restructuring plan to consolidate all of our vad manufacturing operations to our facilities in pleasanton  california 
through april  the completion date of the restructuring plan  we recorded a total of million in restructuring charges 
these charges represent estimated employee severance costs and stock option acceleration charges 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
evaluation of purchased intangibles and goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management must make estimates of these future cash flows and the approximate discount rate  and if any of these estimates proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets on our consolidated balance sheet could become significantly impaired 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased amortizing purchased goodwill 
we complete an impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets subject to amortization as required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
upon completion of our impairment tests as of the end of the year  we determined that neither goodwill nor intangible assets were impaired 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales for our cardiovascular and itc business segments when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers upon shipment 
one of our distributors has certain limited product return rights 
one other distributor has certain rights of return upon termination of its distribution agreement 
a reserve for sales returns is recorded for these customers applying reasonable estimates of product returns based upon significant historical experience 
no other direct sales customers or distributors have return rights or price protection 
sales of certain cardiovascular segment products to first time customers are recognized when it has been determined that the customer has the ability to use such products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
for most customers  training is not essential to the functionality of the products as the customers already possess sufficient expertise and experience to use the products 
in these situations  training is provided as a best practice to optimize the use and success of the products 
the amount of revenue under these arrangements allocated to training is based upon fair market value of the training  which is performed principally by third party providers 
the amount of product sales allocated to the cardiovascular segment products is done on a fair value basis 
under this basis  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the cardiovascular segment products based on the relative fair market value of the training and products 
the amount of product sales allocated to training is recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized when the training is completed 
as of the end of fiscal  all products that had been delivered and recorded as product sales were delivered to customers for which training had been 
table of contents completed 
there was no amount of product sales deferred related to this training not yet completed at the end of  however   of such product sales were deferred at the end of and million at the end of the majority of our products are covered by up to a two year limited manufacturer s warranty from the date of installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated management makes decisions on such things as credit worthiness and warranty reserves 
if these decisions prove incorrect  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet could be significantly different 
reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management must make judgments to determine the amount of reserves to accrue  if management estimates prove incorrect  our financial statements could be adversely affected

our sales of destination therapy implants were lower in than we had originally anticipated  and we expect product sales for this indication to increase more slowly than we had originally projected 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales for and was and  respectively 
within these essentially flat margins were the following significant fluctuations a higher margin on cardiovascular products resulting from a shift in sales mix from lower to higher margin products  partially offset by higher manufacturing costs 
a lower margin on point of care revenue  primarily related to the irma product line  plus higher manufacturing and shipping costs associated in part with the shift in sales from distributor to direct channels 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in the million increase in spending was primarily attributable to the following increased headcount from employees at the end of to at the end of to at the end of  together with annual salary  fringe benefit and other cost increases of million

the primary component of our research and development costs is employee salaries and benefits 
research and development costs also include regulatory and clinical costs associated with our compliance with fda regulations 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million compared to million in as there were no new acquisitions coupled with the million write off of the aria assets at the end of fiscal year in process research and development costs we had no in process research and development charges in in process research and development expense in was million related to our acquisition of the irma product line

we did not have these notes or any other debt instrument in interest income and other interest income and other in was million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our portfolio based on increased cash balances in compared income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the reduction in our effective tax on a comparative basis was due primarily to a combination of reduced tax basis profitability in the current year  increased interest income from tax favorable investments  increased research and development credits  offset in part by increased expenditures for non deductible expenses 
fiscal years and product sales product sales in were million compared to million in the primary components of the million  or  increase in product sales were as follows higher vad sales of million

higher graft sales of million 
higher revenue from sales of ancillary products of million 
higher revenue from itc sales of point of care diagnostic test systems of million revenue of million from irma product line acquired by itc in the fourth quarter of gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in to in due to the following higher vad average selling prices resulted in a increase in margin  largely as a result of sales in of our heartmate vad representing a higher percentage of our revenue when compared to the lower priced thoratec vad 
the heartmate vad typically had an average selling price of between  and  while the thoratec vad typically sold for between  and  lower margins on our itc products resulted in a decline in our overall margins 
this includes the impact of the irma product line we acquired in the fourth quarter of which operated with margins in the range  compared to the margins on other products sold by itc which were typically in the range  and the impact of higher scrap  higher freight  and lower asp s in our incision product line 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in the million increase in spending was primarily attributable to the following increased headcount from employees at the end of to at the end of to at the end of  together with annual salary increases aggregating effective january higher spending on medicare reimbursement activities and market research and related activities  primarily associated with destination therapy  and costs associated with the irma product line acquired in the fourth quarter of higher insurance premiums higher facilities costs related to higher headcount 
these higher costs were offset in part by lower legal costs in due to our filing with the sec a registration statement in that did not recur in  and lower meeting expenses related to a customer event in that did not recur in research and development research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in research and development costs are largely project driven  and the level of spending depends on the level of project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted

impairment of intangible asset subsequent to the year ended  we completed an assessment of the final results from our feasibility clinical trial for the aria cabg graft  which was ongoing through fiscal based on the clinical trial results  we determined that it would not devote additional resources to the development of the aria graft 
upon the decision to discontinue product development  we recorded an impairment charge of million as of january  to write off purchased intangible assets related to the aria graft  which were recorded as a result of the merger with tca

interest expense there was no interest expense in and million in this decrease was due to less interest paid due to the redemption of our debentures in march we had no debt in interest income and other interest income and other in was million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on invested cash in  which resulted in a decrease in interest income  and the impact of our foreign exchange hedging program commenced in income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to an effective tax rate of in this reduction reflects the relatively larger impact of various tax incentives  nondeductible expenses and tax credits in when net income subject to tax was less than million 
based on a pre tax loss in of million  the impact of these tax differences was proportionately lower 
liquidity and capital resources at january   we had working capital of million compared with million at january  cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments at january  were million compared to million at january  the increase is due primarily to unexpended proceeds from our convertible debt offering in the second quarter of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january  was million  after payments of litigation expenses for a settled litigation matter and annual bonuses accrued at january  totaling million 
in addition  investing activities used million  with million net purchases of investments and million to acquire property  plant and equipment 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment consisted of million for equipment and million for leasehold improvements 
cash provided by financing activities for the year was million  including million net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible notes and an additional million from proceeds related to stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million paid to repurchase million shares of stock under our stock repurchase programs 
a portion of the debt offering proceeds were used to purchase and pledge million to the trustee under the indenture for the exclusive benefit of the holders of the convertible notes  us government securities to provide for the payment  in full  of the first six scheduled interest payments 
additional net proceeds were used to repurchase million shares of our outstanding common stock for million 
the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include additional stock repurchases  strategic investments or acquisitions 
the convertible notes were issued at an issue price of per note  which is of the principal amount at maturity of the notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount at maturity  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  from november  until may  beginning on may   the original issue discount will accrue daily at a rate of per year on a semi annual bond equivalent basis and  on the maturity date  a holder will receive  per note 
as a result  the aggregate principal amount of the notes at maturity will be million 
in february and july  the board of directors authorized stock repurchase programs under which up to an aggregate of million of our common stock could be acquired in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases were based on several conditions  including the price of our stock  general market conditions and other factors 
in may  in conjunction with our convertible notes offering  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock 
as of january   we had repurchased and retired million shares with an aggregate purchase price of million under these combined programs 

table of contents we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and stock repurchase programs for at least the next twelve months 
the impact of inflation on our financial position and the results of operations was not significant during any of the periods presented 
contractual obligations as of january   we had the following contractual obligations in millions total thereafter long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our operating lease obligations of million were comprised of our various leased facilities and office equipment 
our purchase obligations of million were comprised of supply agreements in effect at january  a includes interest of million and original issue discount of million 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements in this report for data related to long term debt 
letter of credit in the third quarter of we obtained an irrevocable standby letter of credit for  as part of our worker s compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is not collateralized 
the letter of credit expires on june  and is scheduled to automatically renew each year on june th 
accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement share based payment this statement requires that stock based compensation be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such cost be measured based on the fair value of the stock based compensation 
our adoption of this statement  which we expect to occur in the third quarter of  will have a material  although non cash  impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to provide additional guidance in determining whether investment securities have an impairment which should be considered other than temporary 
on september  the fasb issued proposed fsp eitf issue a to address the application of the eitf issue to debt securities that are affected by interest rate and or sector spread changes only 
on september   the fasb issued fsp eitf issue  which delayed the effective date of certain paragraphs of the eitf until eitf a is issued 
we did however  adopt the disclosure provisions in the fourth quarter of  the adoption had no effect on our operating results or financial condition 
management expects that the adoption of the delayed portions of this issue and the related fsp s will not have a significant effect on our operating results or financial condition once adopted 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  relating to contingently convertible securities to provide disclosure guidance for contingently convertible securities 
we adopted the disclosure provisions in the second quarter of as they apply to the convertible notes 
the million shares underlying our convertible notes are reportable under this new disclosure are antidilutive and  therefore  have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share 
see note in october  eitf issue no 
 accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share was issued 
issue no 
states that shares 
table of contents available under contingently convertible debt should be included in diluted earnings per share  or eps  in all periods  since the notes were issued  except when inclusion is anti dilutive  regardless of whether the contingency is met and regardless of whether the market price contingency is substantial 
our adoption of this proposed interpretation  in the fourth quarter of  did not have a material impact on our most recent consolidated results as the effect of the million shares issuable upon conversion of the notes was anti dilutive 
if in future periods the shares would be dilutive  then million shares will be added to our share count used to calculate diluted earnings per share  and this inclusion could result in lower diluted eps than if the existing guidance had not been changed by eitf item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is made up of cash equivalent and marketable investments in auction rate securities  money market funds  debt instruments of government agencies  us treasuries  local municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
all investments are carried at market value and are treated as available for sale 
all investments mature within two years or less from the date of purchase  except for some investments in us treasuries held as restricted investments as collateral for future interest payments related to our convertible debt  which mature within three years from the date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline which could result in a loss if we are forced to sell an investment before the scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points the change in our net unrealized loss on investments would be nominal 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued at a fixed rate of interest 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
our international operations consist primarily of sales and service personnel for our ventricular assist products  who report to our us sales and marketing group and are internally reported as part of that group 
all assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the period end exchange rates and the resulting translation adjustments are included in comprehensive income 
the period end translation of the non functional currency assets and liabilities primarily assets and liabilities on our uk subsidiary consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds at the period end exchange rates result in foreign currency gains and losses  which are included in interest income and other 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of these non functional currency assets and liabilities 
these derivatives are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges under sfas no 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts are included as interest income and other 
the change in the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts typically offsets the change in value from revaluation of the non functional currency assets and liabilities 
these contracts typically have maturities of three months or less 
at january  and january   we had forward foreign currency contracts in pounds sterling and euros with a notional value of million and million  respectively 
these contracts had an average exchange rate of euros to pounds sterling of 
and pounds sterling to the us dollar of 
as of january  the impact of foreign currency revaluation  net of forward foreign currency contracts  was million for the year ended january  and was negligible for the year ended january
