item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recent developments we are currently enrolling patients in a pivotal phase iii trial in which our polyheme human hemoglobin based oxygen carrier is being used for the first time in the us to treat severely injured patients in hemorrhagic shock before they reach the hospital 
under this protocol  treatment with polyheme begins at the scene of the injury or in the ambulance and continues during transport and the initial hour post injury period in the hospital 
since blood is not presently carried in ambulances  the use of polyheme in this setting has the potential to improve survival and address a critical  unmet medical need 
the trial has a planned enrollment of patients 
approximately patients have been enrolled in the trial as of june  at the current enrollment rate  at the presently active sites  northfield projects enrollment of approximately patients by calendar year end 
our current goal is to complete the patient enrollment phase of our trial in early calendar our ability to achieve this goal will depend  in part  on the number of clinical sites participating in our trial and the ability of these sites to enroll patients at the projected rates 
since northfield s incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we have incurred operating losses during each year of our operations since inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for the next several years 
from northfield s inception through may   we have incurred operating losses totaling  we will be required to complete our pivotal phase iii trial and obtain regulatory approval from fda before polyheme can be sold commercially 
the fda regulatory process is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
we therefore cannot at this time reasonably estimate the timing of any future revenues from the commercial sale of polyheme 
the costs incurred by northfield to date and during each period presented below in connection with our development of polyheme are discussed in our financial statements 
our success will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain fda regulatory approval of polyheme and our manufacturing facilities  obtain sufficient quantities of blood to manufacture polyheme in commercial quantities  manufacture and distribute polyheme in a cost effective manner  enforce our patent positions and raise sufficient capital to fund these activities 
we have experienced significant delays in the development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve these goals or that we will be able to realize product revenues or profitability on a sustained basis or at all 
results of operations we reported no revenues for the fiscal years ended may   or from northfield s inception through may   we have reported total revenues of  all of which were derived from licensing fees 
operating expenses operating expenses for our fiscal years ended may   and totaled   and  respectively 
measured on a percentage basis  fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by  while fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by during fiscal  research and development expenses totaled  an increase of  or  from fiscal expenses of  during fiscal  we significantly expanded our pivotal phase iii trial 
nine additional trial sites were opened during fiscal with the attendant community consultation  training and trial initiation costs 
patient enrollment likewise accelerated with more clinical sites open and more sites gaining experience with the trial protocol 
the direct costs of the trial  hospital site activity and contract research activity increased by  or  in fiscal additional costs were also recorded for increasing staff  benefit costs and science consulting 
we anticipate a continued high level of research and development spending in fiscal continued patient enrollment at an expanded number of clinical sites is forecast during fiscal following completion of the enrollment stage of the trial  we will begin the significant task of data assembly  analysis and reporting to fda 
preparing the biologics license application for polyheme to be filed with fda will likely continue beyond fiscal at the same time  we will be manufacturing product for the trial and undergoing an extensive process of preparation for fda s review of our manufacturing facility 
northfield s internal research and development resources will be focused on these tasks and the use of external resources will be expanded to complete the tasks in a timely manner 
during fiscal  research and development expenses totaled  an increase of  or  from the fiscal expenses of  during fiscal  we began enrolling patients in our pivotal phase iii trial 
in december   the first trial site was initiated and by may   the number of sites enrolling patients had grown to eleven 
the expense of site training  initiating and monitoring along with patient study costs were the sources of the increased costs 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year totaled  an increase of  or  from the expense incurred in the prior fiscal year 
the extensive procedure  documentation and testing requirements relating to our internal controls over financial reporting mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of were primarily responsible for a  or  increase in professional services in fiscal compared to fiscal also  state corporate franchise taxes  which are calculated based on northfield s share capital  significantly increased following our successful public stock offering in february general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended may  totaled  an increase of  or  from the expenses incurred in the comparable prior year period 
during our fiscal year  we pursued significant administrative initiatives to expand and further protect our intellectual property portfolio and to conduct market research on the commercial potential of polyheme 
expenses in connection with these initiatives accounted for all of the increases in fiscal we anticipate a decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to the  incurred in fiscal ongoing internal controls compliance costs are expected to be reduced in fiscal and should offset cost increases anticipated for new hires and commercialization planning 
throughout fiscal  the corporate focus will remain centered on successfully executing our pivotal phase iii trial 
interest income interest income in fiscal equaled  compared to  in fiscal the current year increase is the result of larger available cash resources as well as higher interest rates on our short term investments 
in february  we raised  in net proceeds from an underwritten public stock offering 
these funds are currently invested in short term marketable securities 
available interest rates at the beginning of the current fiscal year were between and for money market investments and for high quality one year securities 
money market rates in july were approximately to and high quality one year securities were approaching 
as our current investments mature  they will be rolled over into higher yielding securities until the funds are required for our business 
interest income in fiscal equaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the  in interest income reported in fiscal lower available investment balances and lower interest rates caused the decrease 
following our successful public offering in february  we anticipate that interest income will increase significantly in fiscal the extent of the increase will be dependent on the rate of our use of cash in operations and the timing of investment in plant and equipment  as well as available interest rates 
a rate increase yields  in additional interest income on a  investment over a month period 
net loss the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increased net loss was the result of increased clinical trial expenses and professional service fees 
the net loss per share increased by only 
because the average number of shares outstanding in the current fiscal year increased as a result of our recent public offering and diluted the increased dollar loss in the current fiscal year 
the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increased net loss was primarily due to higher research and development costs associated with our pivotal phase iii trial 
the net loss per share was the same for both fiscal years because the average number of shares outstanding in our fiscal year increased as a result of fundraising efforts completed in fiscal which diluted the increased dollar loss in fiscal liquidity and capital resources from northfield s inception through may   we have used cash in operating activities and for the purchase of property  plant  equipment and engineering services in the amount of  for the fiscal years ended may   and  these cash expenditures totaled   and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in cash utilization is due primarily to expenses related to our pivotal phase iii trial 
we have financed our research and development and other activities to date through the public and private sale of equity securities and  to a more limited extent  through the license of product rights 
in february  we raised  in net proceeds from an underwritten public stock offering 
as of may   we had cash and marketable securities totaling  we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund the completion of the patient enrollment phase of our pivotal phase iii clinical trial  the preparation and submission of a biologics license application for polyheme with fda  our planned construction of a  unit commercial manufacturing facility  and our operating capital requirements for approximately the next months 
thereafter  we may require substantial additional funding to continue our operations 
we may issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  which could provide us with additional funding or absorb expenses we would otherwise be required to pay 
we are also pursuing potential sources of government funding 
any one or a combination of these sources may be utilized to raise additional capital 
we believe our ability to raise additional capital or enter into a collaborative arrangement with a strategic partner will depend primarily on the results of our clinical trial  as well as general conditions in the business and financial markets 
our inability to raise sufficient levels of capital could materially delay or prevent the commercialization of polyheme  even if it is approved by fda 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated because of the timing and results of our clinical testing of polyheme  the establishment of relationships with strategic partners  changes in the scale  timing or cost of our commercial manufacturing facility  competitive and technological advances  the fda regulatory process  changes in our marketing and distribution strategy and other factors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policy reflects our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required  such as our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event we were to determine that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their carrying value  an adjustment to recognize the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of may   we have recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  less than contractual obligations total one year years years lease obligations     other obligations   total contractual obligations     the lease for our evanston headquarters is cancelable with six months notice combined with a termination payment equal to three months base rent at any time after february  if the lease is cancelled as of february  unamortized broker commissions of  would also be due 
represents payments required to be made upon termination of employment agreements with two of our executive officers 
the employment contracts renew automatically unless terminated 
figures shown represent compensation payable upon the termination of the employment agreements for reasons other than death  disability  cause or voluntary termination of employment by the executive officer other than for good reason 
additional payments may be required under the employment agreements in connection with a termination of employment of the executive officer following a change in control of northfield 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r for the period ended august  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see footnote no 
stock based compensation for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts  for through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have an impact on our statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not have any foreign currency exchange risk 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that the financial market risk exposure is not material 
a one percentage point decrease in the interest rate received over a one year period on our cash and marketable securities of million at may  would decrease interest income by
