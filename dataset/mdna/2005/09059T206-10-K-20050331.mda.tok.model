overview we develop needle free injection systems that improve the way patients receive medications and vaccines 
in fiscal  we changed our fiscal year end from march to december the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto prepared in accordance with us gaap contained elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion and analysis explains trends in our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  and for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  unaudited 
our long term goal is to become the leading supplier of needle free injection systems to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries 
in  we continued to focus our business development efforts on new and existing licensing and supply agreements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
in  we i signed a second license and supply agreement with merial granting an exclusive license for use of a modified version of our vitajet needle free injector system for use in veterinary clinics to administer vaccines for the companion animal market  ii signed a supply agreement with ferring pharmaceuticals inc ferring to provide it with our needle free vial adapters to be used with a drug currently on the market  iii signed a collaboration agreement with program for appropriate technology in health path  an international non profit organization  to design and develop a needle free  single dose cartridge immunization system for their evaluation  and iv entered into a license agreement with a leading japanese pharmaceutical company whereby our iject product will be utilized to administer an undisclosed indication exclusively in japan 
by bundling customized needle free delivery systems with partners injectable medications and vaccines  we can enhance demand for these products in the healthcare provider and end user markets 
in  our clinical research efforts continued to be aimed primarily at collaborations in the areas of vaccines and drug delivery 
currently  we are involved in collaborations with institutions 
in  our research and development efforts focused on moving our ml iject from the clinical phase to the production phase  which includes bringing on line our sterile fill capabilities 
in addition  we have continued to work on product improvements to existing devices and development of products for our strategic partners 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
various factors may affect quarterly and yearly operating results including i the length of time to close product sales  ii customer budget cycles  iii the implementation of cost reduction measures  iv uncertainties and changes in product sales due to third party payer policies and proposals relating to healthcare cost containment  v the timing and amount of payments under licensing and technology development agreements  and vi the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
we do not expect to report net income in termination of certain employees effective june   we completed a corporate reorganization which eliminated layers of management  reduced our negative cash flow in future periods  and allows for more direct interface with senior management and operations 
we terminated our executive vice president and general manager  our senior vice president and chief scientific officer and our senior director of manufacturing operations 
we do not intend to refill these positions 
severance related to these terminations totaled  of which  was satisfied with  shares of our common stock and  of which was paid in we anticipate annualized savings of approximately  of salary plus taxes and benefits of  related to these terminations 
the severance expense is included in our statement of operations for as follows manufacturing expense research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense of the total severance expense   is included in accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid over the next three quarters  and  is included in equity on our consolidated balance sheet at december  cash requirements for next twelve months anticipated requirements for cash for the next twelve months from december  are estimated to total approximately million as follows estimated cash required for operations current portion of long term debt current portion of capital leases estimated cash capital expenditures cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  in addition to our current cash resources  we have a million line of credit with million available at december  results of operations due to the fiscal year end change to december  the fiscal year ended december  is comprised of only nine months

these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in sales of our vial adapter product to berlex 
these increases were due to an increase in units sold 
we did not have any significant sales price increases for our products in compared to significant sales of our vial adapter to amgen began in the third quarter of amgen packages the vial adapter with one of its drugs for resale to the end user 
in september  we signed a supply agreement with ferring to provide it with our needle free vial adapters to be used with a drug currently on the market 
we anticipate annual product sales related to this agreement to total between  and  with  recognized in the million  or  increase in product sales in compared to was due primarily to million in sales of our vial adapter product to amgen in compared to nominal sales to amgen in the increase was partially offset by reduced serojet sales  which were  in compared to  in the million  or  increase in license and technology fees in compared to was primarily due to the recognition of an additional  in compared to  pursuant to the terms of the production and companion animal license and supply agreements we have with merial  and the recognition of a  non refundable development fee and a  wind down fee from a potential licensing partner 
the million  or  decrease in license and technology fees in compared to was primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition see discussion of deferred revenue below and the recognition of a million non refundable development fee in  which was received from amgen 
this fee was received in the quarter ended december  and was to be recognized over the term of the agreement with amgen 
however  in the quarter ended march   amgen terminated its license and development agreement and  accordingly  we recognized the entire million in that quarter 
we currently have active licensing and or development agreements with serono  merial  and an undisclosed japanese pharmaceutical firm 
we currently have active product supply agreements with amgen  ferring and chronimed 
manufacturing expense manufacturing expense is made up of the cost of products sold and manufacturing overhead expense related to excess manufacturing capacity

selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative costs include labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
the  or  decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to was primarily due to a  reduction in recruiting and relocation costs  a  decrease in non severance related salaries and a  decrease in various other costs  partially offset by  of severance costs in related to the terminations discussed above 
the  or  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to increases in labor and legal costs being mostly offset by lower consulting costs 
interest income interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates and lower cash and investment balances in compared to and in compared to the lower cash and investment balances are due to the fact that  until the fourth quarter of  we had not raised any capital since december and  therefore  had been utilizing existing cash and investment balances for operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold  shares of series d convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
in addition  we received million of proceeds from a term loan in the fourth quarter of accordingly  we anticipate increased interest income in compared to interest expense interest expense increased to  in compared to  in due to our million outstanding term loan with us bank  which was not outstanding during the periods and was repaid in the fourth quarter of  as well as our million term loan  which was entered into in the fourth quarter of we expect interest expense to increase in as a result of our million term loan

total cash  cash equivalents  short and long term marketable securities and restricted funds at december  were million compared to million at december  working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  the overall decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities during resulted primarily from million used in operations  million used for capital expenditures   used for other investing activities  primarily patent applications  million used for principal payments on long term debt and capital leases and  of debt issuance costs  partially offset by million of net proceeds from the sale of series d preferred stock and million of proceeds from a term loan

capital expenditures of million in were primarily for the purchase of production automation equipment for sterile fill for our iject disposable product and capital expenditures related to our move to a larger facility in the second quarter of we anticipate spending up to a total of million in for production molds and manufacturing capabilities 
accounts payable increased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to increased inventory purchases  partially offset by a reduction of balances owed to our contract filler and mold suppliers 
other accrued liabilities decreased to  at december  from  at december  due primarily to the reduction of accrued sales tax and accrued payments to our sterile fill process vendor  offset by the accrual of  of severance at december   which will be paid over the next three quarters and  related to a warrant to be issued 
deferred revenue totaled  at december  compared to  at december  the balance at december  represents amounts received from serono pursuant to their license agreement and from a japanese pharmaceutical company

if the closing price of our common stock is at or above per share for consecutive trading days  the fee will be reduced to per month 
under the credit agreement  we granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets to pfg to secure their obligations under the credit agreement 
at december   we did not have any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and million was available for future advances 
both the term loan and credit agreement restricted our ability to incur additional debt and prohibit us from paying dividends  repurchasing stock and engaging in other transactions outside the ordinary course of business  among other things 
our obligations under the term loan and credit agreement accelerate upon certain events  including a sale or change of control of bioject 
in connection with these agreements  on december   we issued to pfg a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires on december  the value of this warrant was determined to be  utilizing the black scholes valuation model 
the unamortized value of  at december  is recorded on our balance sheet as components of other current assets and other assets  net  as described above 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond long term debt capital commitments operating leases capital leases purchase order commitments new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues  inventory valuation  and long lived asset impairment 
revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  product development revenue is recognized  to the extent of cash received  on a percentage of completion basis as qualifying expenditures are incurred 
licensing revenues  if separable  are recognized over the term of the license agreement 
the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf finalized eitf accounting for multiple element arrangements in november eitf requires arrangements with multiple elements to be broken out as separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only if the amount due can be reliably measured and the earnings process is substantially complete 
any units that can not be separated must be accounted for as a combined unit 
our accounting policy is consistent with eitf should agreements be terminated prior to completion  or our estimates of percentage of completion be incorrect  we could have unanticipated fluctuations in our revenue on a quarterly basis 
amounts received prior to meeting recognition criteria are recorded on our balance sheet as deferred revenues and are recognized according to the terms of the associated agreements 
at december   deferred revenues totaled approximately  and include amounts received from serono and a japanese pharmaceutical company pursuant to their agreements 
inventory valuation we evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including the following historical and forecasted sales and usage rates  anticipated technology improvements and product upgrades  as well as other factors 
all inventories are reviewed quarterly to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices and if certain components have become obsolete 
we record valuation adjustments for inventory based on the above factors 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate our long lived assets and certain identified intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
based on these analyses  we did not recognize any impairment on our long lived assets during the periods presented 
if circumstances related to our long lived assets change  we may record an impairment charge in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and on our fixed and variable interest rate debt 
we mitigate the risk in our investment portfolio by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have outstanding a variable rate term loan and line of credit agreement 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in rates 
at december   we had million outstanding under our term loan at an interest rate of 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit agreement at december  assuming the balances remained constant in  a increase in interest rates would result in an approximately  increase in interest expense
