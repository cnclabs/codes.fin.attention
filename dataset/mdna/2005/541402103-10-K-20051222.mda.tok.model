overview logic is one of the smallest publicly traded semiconductor makers 
following our formation  we initially developed plug compatible second source products that were form  fit  and function compatible with products offered by other manufacturers 
beginning in  we began identifying unique  proprietary products driven by our existing customer base 
while this transition to proprietary products required us to obtain advanced design automation tools and to increase the number of people involved in product development  it enabled us to focus our sales channels and limit the costs of those channels  and to compete in markets with pricing and delivery demands that are not as highly competitive as the markets for second source products 
we primarily derive our revenues from the sale of semiconductor chips that perform high speed dsp in video image filtering and digital communications applications 
our transition to a proprietary product focus has had a significant impact on our financial results 
we anticipated increased revenues from the hdtv market starting in  but the delays in the broadcast industry s transition to high definition from analog signals originally scheduled to be and currently scheduled to be completed by resulted in less revenues from these products than we anticipated 
we anticipate revenues from our newer proprietary products to increase as the hdtv market begins to ramp up 
beginning november  the fcc directed that television broadcasters begin a transition from analog broadcasts to hdtv  which offers cleared pictures and better sound  with all analog broadcasts now scheduled to cease by originally scheduled for 
unfortunately  the broadcasters remain behind the schedules mandates 
in august  the fcc issued an order to television manufacturers that requires digital tuners to be incorporated into percent of the television sets with screens of or more inches starting in  into percent of the sets with screens of inches starting in  and into all sets with screens of inches or more by on october   the us court of appeals for the dc circuit upheld the fcc mandate that  by  all but the very smallest television sets sold in the us must be equipped for receiving digital  along with traditional analog  television signals 
the court said the fcc s mandate was needed because the industry was not moving quickly enough to make new tuners available 
on december   we elected to change our calendar business year to a fiscal year ending september previously  our fiscal years were comprised of weeks of seven days  each beginning on monday and ending on sunday  with fiscal ending september  as a result of this change  our fiscal year ended september  rather than september  the additional four days were included in our first quarter for fiscal  which ended december  liquidity and capital resources despite a loss of  for fiscal  our operations produced net cash of  which is mainly the result of a reduction of inventories of  the collection of a sales tax refund of  and an increase in accounts payable of  at year end 
the increase in accounts payable was from the timing of purchases and invoices being received but not yet due at year end 
we maintain our prompt payment terms with our vendors 
the percent decrease in our net cash balance from  in fiscal to  at september  was the result of a substantial increase in capital expenditures totaling  including one time purchases of  of engineering design software and capitalized software development costs of  during fiscal  our operations produced  of net cash  despite a  net loss 
this was mainly from the net collection of accounts receivable of  reductions in inventories of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses of  and an increase in accounts payable of  at year end 
even though we maintain prompt payments to vendors  the accounts payable balance increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the invoices of some vendors being received during the last week of the fiscal year and not yet being due as of the end of the fiscal year 
we also received  of cash from the exercise of common stock options 
we used this and the cash from operations to fund capital purchases of  and capitalized software development costs of  which resulted in our cash position decreasing by one percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal during fiscal  our operations produced  of net cash  despite a  net loss 
this was mainly the result of the net collection of accounts receivable of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses of  at the same time  we maintained our prompt payment terms with vendors  so accounts payable decreased  we used cash from operations to purchase capital assets aggregating  and to fund the repurchase of  of our common stock on the open market 
our cash position increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal our current working capital requirements are greatly reduced due to the cost cutting of the past few years 
we believe that these cost cutting actions and our continued focus on higher margin products should result in after tax cash earnings being sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
based on the fact that  as of december   we hold approximately million in cash reserves and our cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than our current revenue rate  we believe we can cover our cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
working capital our investment in inventories has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
however  during the past few years  we have been able to reduce our levels of inventories as we shift from more competitive second source products to proprietary sole source products 
we seek to further streamline our inventories as we continue to shift to sole source proprietary products 
we rely on third party suppliers for our raw materials  particularly our processed wafers  for which we currently rely primarily on two suppliers  and as a result  maintain substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
we have periodically experienced disruptions in obtaining wafers 
as we continue to shift towards higher margin proprietary products  we expect to be able to reduce inventory levels by streamlining our product offerings 
periodically  we review inventory to determine recoverability of items on hand using the lower of cost or market locom and excess methods 
we group and evaluate our products based on their underlying die or wafer type our raw materials  silicon wafers  can generally be used to make multiple products  to determine the total quantity on hand and average unit costs 
management uses judgment in comparing historical sales quantities to the quantity on hand at the end of the fiscal year 
if the quantity on hand exceeds the sales quantities  we provide a reserve for the potentially obsolete or slow moving items 
for the locom analysis  we compare the average historical sales price to the average unit cost of inventories at the end of the fiscal year 
if the average unit cost exceeds the average sales price  we provide a reserve 
with continuing low revenue levels  our management felt it necessary to also review our raw materials and work in process 
our products generally exhibit an active sales product life cycle of ten or more years 
however  due to rapid changes in process technology  we are generally unable to obtain wafers for our products for as long a period as their life cycles 
as a result  early in a product s life  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle and purchase materials upfront 
on some occasions  our expectations become lower and we provide a reserve for potential excess materials 
in fiscal and  we increased our inventory reserve by  and  respectively  for potential excess materials 
in addition  during fiscal and  we scrapped inventory of  and  respectively  and in fiscal  we wrote off  of work in process inventory  all of which was directly expensed to the cost of revenues 
we believe our current reserve of  for inventory provides a reasonable estimate of the recoverability of inventories at the end of fiscal although current levels of inventory impact our liquidity  we believe that this is a less costly alternative to owning a wafer fabrication facility or continuously redesigning our products to newer process technologies  which would divert limited engineering resources from new product development 
we continue to evaluate alternative suppliers to diversify our risk of supply disruption 
however  this requires a significant investment in product development to tool masks with new suppliers 
such efforts compete for our limited product development resources 
we seek to achieve on going reductions in inventory  although there can be no assurance we will be successful 
in the event economic conditions remain slow  we may consider identifying additional portions of inventory to write off at a future date 
historically  due to customer order scheduling  up to of our quarterly revenues were often shipped in the last month of the quarter  so a large portion of the shipments included in year end accounts receivable were not yet due per our net day terms 
this results in year end accounts receivable balances being at their highest point for the respective period 
financing while we will continue to evaluate future debt and equity financing opportunities  we believe the cost reductions implemented in the past few years have resulted in the cash flow generated from operations providing an adequate base of liquidity to fund future operating and capital needs 
based on the fact that  as of december   we hold approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than our current revenue rate  we believe we can cover our cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
contractual obligations below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations 
payment timing may be subject to change 
payments due by period total within year years after years operating leases buildings equipment off balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues for fiscal decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  we continue to experience a drop off in sales of our older products that is not yet offset by revenues from newer products 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry and a sluggish economy also contributed to the decrease in revenues 
in fiscal  we introduced a new video frame buffer product  the lf  and continue to pursue new sales of the lf  which we introduced at the end of fiscal we hope to generate increased revenues from the lf and its related family of parts in fiscal while net revenues decreased by percent  cost of revenues increased three percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result  our gross profit as a percentage of revenues actually decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal gross profit declined as a result of a  increase to our inventory reserve  which is included in cost of revenues 
our products generally exhibit an active sales product life cycle of ten or more years 
however  due to rapid changes in process technology  we are generally unable to obtain wafers for our products for as long a period as their life cycles 
as a result  early in a product s life  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle and purchase materials upfront 
on some occasions  our expectations become lower and we provide a reserve for or write down potential excess materials 
while new product introductions are key to our future growth and success  our decreasing revenues continue to strain our research and development efforts 
research and development r d expenditures decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  resulting primarily from reductions in staffing that took place during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  this amount is closer to our goal of percent percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal 
we believe our current team is made up of very qualified individuals that are capable of accelerating new product introductions in the future 
we continue to control our spending by reducing selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses  while still supporting an adequate sales force to sell existing products and new product introductions 
in fiscal  our sg a expenditures decreased percent from  in fiscal to  while net revenues decreased  the greater reductions in expenditures resulted in a decrease in our loss from operations from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  an percent reduction  even though we made a significant increase to our inventory reserve 
a reduction in our cash balances during fiscal resulted in interest income from deposits decreasing from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of the foregoing  our net loss decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  despite the percent reduction in net revenues 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues for fiscal decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  this decrease was due to a down cycle of the semiconductor industry  a continued sluggish economy  and the prolonged delay in the widespread adoption of hdtv broadcasting 
in addition  we continued to experience a drop off in sales of our older products that is not counterbalanced by revenues from newer products 
while our net revenues decreased by percent  our cost of revenues  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased by percentage points 
this reduction in the cost of revenues is the result of the cost cutting of the past several years and the changes to the inventory reserve being much higher in fiscal compared to fiscal we increased our inventory reserve by approximately million in fiscal  while we increased the reserve by only  in fiscal as a result of the foregoing  our gross profit increased by percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal revenue constraints forced us to decrease r d expenditures percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal however  as a percentage of net revenues  this decrease in expenditures still left us over our target of percent 
as a percentage of net revenues  r d expenditures decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditures decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this reduction is a result of the cost cutting of the past several years  including but not limited to a reduction in staffing  a reduction of office space and rent  and reductions in directors and officers insurance levels 
while we incurred a reduction of net revenues in fiscal  greater reductions of expenditures resulted in a percent decrease in the loss from operations  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to slightly decreased cash balances during the year  our interest income from deposits decreased percent in fiscal from  in fiscal to  as a result of the foregoing  our net loss for fiscal decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this report and the data used to prepare them 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and we are required to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
the summary of accounting policies included with the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our judgments  estimates  and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  and valuation of long lived assets 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are the critical accounting policies we believe are affected by significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide the distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
revenues from such sales are recognized upon shipment  with a provision for estimated returns and allowances recorded at that time  if applicable 
while distributors are allowed to return items for stock rotation  they are required to place an order of equal or greater value at the same time 
therefore  no allowance for returns is recorded 
because we generally do not change the pricing of our products more than once a year  there have not been any pricing issues in the past several years  therefore  there is no allowance for price protection recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness  and current economic conditions 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to receivables 
inventories we write down our inventories for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves  and obsolescence reserves 
as a result of production requirements and contraints  we are often required to estimate the sales expectations for the entire life cycle of a product which can be ten or more years and purchase materials upfront 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
conversely  if demand increases for product types that have been fully reserved  future margins may be higher 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets  are assessed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  or whenever management has committed to a plan to dispose of the assets 
such assets are carried at the lower of book value or fair value as estimated by management based on appraisals  current market value  and comparable sales value  as appropriate 
assets to be held and used affected by such impairment loss are depreciated or amortized at their new carrying amounts over the remaining estimated life  assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are not subject to further depreciation or amortization 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we use undiscounted future cash flows without interest charges compared to the carrying value of the assets 
deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when we are unable to conclude that our deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax income assets that may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that we will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of september  accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets as of september  impact of new financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  it does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
further  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect of sfas on our financial statements and related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payments 
sfas r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
we are required to apply sfas r on a modified prospective method 
under this method  we are required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
in addition  we may elect to adopt sfas r by restating previously issued financial statements  basing the amounts on the expense previously calculated and reported in their pro forma disclosures that had been required by sfas sfas r is effective for the first reporting period beginning after june  management has not completed its evaluation of the effect that sfas r will have  but believes that the effect will be consistent with the application disclosed in our pro forma disclosures in the notes to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct all of our transactions  including those with foreign suppliers and customers  in us dollars 
we are therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and do not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks 
of course  demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to us may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier s domestic currency to the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  changes in the relative value of the us dollar may change the price of our products relative to the prices of our foreign competitors 
we also do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments that are not considered cash under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
