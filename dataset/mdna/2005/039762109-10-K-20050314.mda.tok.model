results of operations the results of operations for fiscal and reflect the pervasive impact of a labor dispute in the company s trade area that commenced october  and concluded february  the collective bargaining agreement covering the majority of the company s employees  as well as other participating employers in southern california  expired on october  on october   the ufcw declared a strike against vons and in turn  albertsons and ralphs locked out their ufcw employees 
on february   the ufcw announced that employees of these three major grocery retailers ratified a new contract thereby ending the labor dispute 
prior to the labor dispute  the company had agreed with the ufcw to continue operating under a contract extension and to be bound by all modifications regarding trust funds and hourly wage rates as negotiated between the ufcw and the three major grocery retailers 
in return  the ufcw agreed not to strike the company and gelson s remained open 
in a vote held on march   employees of the company who are members of the ufcw  ratified a new labor contract on terms similar to those reached by the three major grocery retailers 
the new labor contract expires in march the labor dispute resulted in a temporary shift in consumer shopping patterns and a significant increase in the company s sales and operating income during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of since the labor dispute  customers have returned to their previous shopping patterns 
however  the company has successfully retained some of the incremental sales from new shoppers that experienced the gelson s format and service during the labor dispute 
during the third quarter of  the company revised the way it classifies income from licensed operations within its supermarkets  subleases  leases and finance charges 
the net rental  license and other income is now recorded as a component of sales on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
previously  the revenue for these items had been classified as a reduction of delivery  selling  general and administrative dsg a expense 
additionally  sales and cost of sales for one licensed department in the company s stores were recorded on the gross basis rather than reporting the net licensed revenue received 
income from all licensing arrangements  rental income and finance charges represents less than of sales for all periods presented  and therefore is not disclosed separately on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the company has revised these amounts as previously reported for each of the periods presented 
none of the classification changes has an impact on operating income  net income  net cash flow or any element of the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company does not consider the effect of these revisions in classification in or in prior periods  individually or in the aggregate  to be material

the company does not believe that inflation or changing prices contributed significantly to the sales increase

the higher expense was partially offset by higher average union health and welfare and pension rates per hour in compared to the prior year  as well as the suspension of ufcw pension plan contributions for two months during in addition  the company incurred fees of approximately  in in connection with sarbanes oxley section compliance 
the new collective bargaining agreement ratified by employees of vons  ralphs and albertsons eliminated the health care maintenance of benefits obligation included in the prior agreement 
the same agreement was ratified by gelson s employees 
the expired agreement provided that if health care maintenance of benefits is eliminated in a successor collective bargaining agreement  employers are required to contribute an amount sufficient to restore the total cash reserves to an amount equal to the unpaid health care claims liability 
the labor dispute resulted in a depletion of funds in the multi employer health and welfare trust fund 
the company was assessed  to pay union health care claims and restore trust fund reserves to the required levels 
this  was reflected as a charge to income in as noted above 
the company contributes to several multi employer union pension and health care plans

no assurance can be given that this change will ultimately result in a reduction in workers compensation expense or limit future increases 
the company devotes substantial time and commitment to maintaining a safe work environment 
the ultimate cost of workers compensation is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of health care costs and the company s ability to manage claims

at this point in time  the company is unable to predict how this legislation will impact overall costs

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management has established accounting policies that they believe are appropriate in order to reflect the accurate reporting of the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
the company applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
management bases their estimates on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for 
table of contents making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  and therefore actual results may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
investments investments are accounted for under the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date 
debt securities for which the company does not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale investments and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders equity

any decline that is determined to be other than temporary is recorded as a loss on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in accordance with eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain issues 
inventories supermarket nonperishable inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
perishable inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first in  first out fifo method or market 
inventory reserves are maintained for dry goods at historical run rates that are adjusted annually  and trued up at each physical count three times per year to ensure adequacy of the reserve 
inventories of perishable items are taken at the end of every month  and balances are adjusted accordingly and flowed through cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized when estimated future cash flows undiscounted and before interest charges are less than carrying value 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
if impairment analysis assumptions change  then an adjustment to the carrying value of the company s long lived assets could occur 
to the extent that an asset is impaired  the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against earnings
