item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this report beginning on page f the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to the differences are discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of high performance  highly reliable fiber optic subsystems and modules for fiber optic transmission systems that are used to address the bandwidth limitations in metropolitan area networks  or mans  local area networks  or lans  and storage area networks  or sans  markets 
our subsystems and modules include optical transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders that convert electronic signals into optical signals and back to electronic signals  enabling high speed communication of voice and data traffic over public and private networks 
we began our operations and shipped our first products in november of furukawa beneficially owns all of our outstanding class b common stock  representing of our outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock as of the fiscal year ended september  since our inception  we have purchased substantially all of our lasers and the majority of our other fiber optic components from furukawa 
we have relied on furukawa s research and development capabilities to provide us with technologically advanced lasers and fiber optic components that we purchase from furukawa for inclusion in our products 
we currently purchase the majority of lasers from furukawa under a master purchase agreement which we entered into with furukawa on october  this agreement automatically renewed on october  and october  and renews automatically each year thereafter unless it is terminated upon written notice by either furukawa or us prior to renewal 
in the last two years  we have negotiated price reductions for the lasers we purchase from furukawa 
however  the laser price reductions that we have been able to obtain from furukawa have been less than the price reductions for the associated products that we have given our customers in response to market conditions 
as a result  our gross margins have been negatively impacted  and may be negatively impacted in the future 
while we continue to negotiate with furukawa with respect to the pricing of the lasers we purchase from them  and while we are exploring alternative sources of supply for the lasers we purchase from furukawa  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in addressing this negative impact on our gross margins 
we operate in one industry segment  the design and manufacture of fiber optic subsystems and modules 
we sell our products to communication equipment manufacturers or cems  their contract manufacturers or cms  who incorporate them into systems they assemble for cems and to distributors 
we define our customers as cems who have purchased our products directly or indirectly through cms and distributors 
we recognize revenue upon product shipment  and sales returns and allowances have been insignificant 
historically  a relatively small number of end customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue 
our largest customers accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively with alcatel and cisco systems including sales to each of their contract manufacturers accounting for approximately and of our total revenue  respectively  in fiscal alcatel and cisco systems including sales to each of their contract manufacturers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and for financial reporting purposes  we consider our customers to be the cems  cms and distributors who place purchase orders with us directly 
for the fiscal year ended september  no direct order contract manufacturer accounted for more than of our total revenue 
for the fiscal year ended september  comstar communications accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
no other direct sales customer accounted for more than of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  although our revenue from sales to our other customers continues to increase  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
our sales are made on a purchase order basis rather than by long term purchase commitments 
our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders without penalty on short notice 
in october  methode electronics  inc filed a lawsuit against infineon technologies corporation and us seeking unspecified damages  including monetary damages  injunctive relief  attorneys fees and costs arising from our alleged infringement of some of the claims contained in patents assigned to methode  including patents relating to our x pin configuration products 
after methode initiated the lawsuit  it assigned to stratos lightwave  inc  a methode spin off  all of methode s rights  title and interest in the patent at issue 
the court subsequently added stratos as a plaintiff to the lawsuit 
on april   we resolved our patent infringement litigation with stratos 
the settlement resolved all claims in the lawsuit among us and stratos 
as part of the settlement  we entered into a five year license agreement with stratos covering stratos portfolio of optoelectronic transceiver patents 
in consideration of the license agreement  we are required to pay a total of million over the license term 
as of september    remained outstanding and is expected to be paid by fiscal year our optoelectronic products covered by this license include our x  gbic  small form factor sff and small form factor pluggable sfp product families 
at the end of the five year term  we have the option to renegotiate with stratos for an extension of the license 
the unfavorable economic conditions in the united states that began in detrimentally affected the us manufacturing industry  particularly sales of fiber optics equipment to service providers and communication equipment companies 
announcements by fiber optics equipment manufacturers and their customers at the time indicated that there was a reduction in spending for fiber optic equipment as a result of the economic slowdown and efforts to reduce then existing inventories 
based on these and other factors  some of our customers reduced  modified  cancelled or rescheduled orders for our products and expressed uncertainty as to their future requirements 
despite an improvement in general economic conditions in the united states since that time  capital spending by service providers in the fiber optic communications industry on network infrastructure has remained substantially below pre levels 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have seen a higher level of activity from our customers which resulted in an increase in new orders compare to previous quarters 
we cannot provide any assurance that the increase in customer activity will continue or that our business will not be negatively impacted in the future as a result of our customers declining business activities 
on october   we acquired certain assets of cielo communications  inc  cielo communications a research and design company located in broomfield  colorado  focused on creating vcsel technology for fiber optic communication networks for a cash purchase price of million and direct costs of million 
the purchase price included the acquisition of capital equipment and intellectual property 
in october we acquired certain assets of cielo communications  inc  a research and design company located in broomfield  colorado  focused on creating nm vcsel technology for fiber optic communication networks 
the purchase price was million and included the acquisition of capital equipment  inventory and intellectual property 
we expect to cease the operation of our colorado facility as of january   because the cost of fabry perot lasers has been decreasing  making nm vcsel technology less attractive as a cost effective replacement  and because of the delay in development of the next generation of optical modules 
as a result  we expect to cease the immediate development of products based on nm vcsel technology  although we will retain the related intellectual property for future development 
on january   we acquired parallel optical module assets and intellectual property from gore photonics  an industry leader in the research and development of vcsel parallel optical modules for fiber optic communication networks located in elkton  maryland  for a cash purchase price of million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment and inventory 
the average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature from factors such as increased competition  the introduction of new products  increased unit volumes  and price concessions required by our customers 
we anticipate that average selling prices of our existing products will continue to decline in future periods although the timing and degree of the declines cannot be predicted with any certainty 
we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices on a timely basis 
our cost of revenue consists principally of materials  as well as salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we purchase several key components for our products from a limited number of suppliers 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel  cost of developing prototypes  and depreciation of test and prototyping equipment 
our research and development expenses also consist of materials and overhead costs related to major product development projects 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our future success 
accordingly  we may expand our internal research and development capabilities in the future to develop new products 
as a result  our research and development expenses in absolute dollar amounts may increase in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  commissions paid to sales personnel and independent manufacturers representatives  marketing and promotion costs 
we may expand our sales and marketing efforts in order to increase sales and market awareness of our products 
we believe that investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and that these expenses may increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  stock compensation and related expenses for our administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect that our legal and consulting fees will increase as a result of our analysis of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities that may be pursued by our management and board of directors 
as a result  our general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars may increase in future periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our financial statements describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  the allowance for inventory obsolescence  warranty accruals  long lived assets and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  was million as of september   compared with million as of september  the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns as of september  was  compared with  as of september  the allowance is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts and potential returns 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay and historical customer returns 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if actual future customer returns were to deviate from our expectations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our operations 
inventory write downs our inventory balance was million as of september   compared with million as of september  at september  and inventory with a historical cost of million and million  respectively  has been written down as excess and obsolete inventory 
we estimate our excess and obsolete inventory primarily through reference to historical usage and future demand forecasts 
at the point of write down  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our write down for excess and obsolete inventory was   and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase inventory write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals the liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was  as of september   compared with  as of september  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  and labor costs 
the provision for product warranties issued during fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than the expectations on which the accrual has been based  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
long lived assets we monitor and evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
for purposes of estimating future cash flows from potentially impaired assets  the company groups assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
our long lived assets subject to impairment are our property  plant and equipment and our intangible assets which had net carrying values of million and  respectively at september  we currently estimate that undiscounted future cash flows will be sufficient to recover the value of our long lived assets 
however  our estimates of future cash flows are subject to change because the underlying assumptions  such as revenues and expenses  are based on projections that may differ from actual future results 
should our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we would be required to determine the fair value of those assets and record a loss for the difference  if any  between the carrying value and the fair value of those assets 
income taxes at september   the unadjusted net book value of our deferred income tax assets totaled approximately million  which was principally comprised of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards and or credit carryforwards and differences between the book and tax bases or our inventories 
the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  require a valuation allowance when  based upon currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
our valuation allowance was increased by  during the year ended september  we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support its reversal 
also  until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  we do not expect to recognize any domestic income tax benefits in future results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data and percentage of change for the twelve months ended september  and twelve months ended sept  change change revenue    cost of revenue    gross profit    expenses research and development    selling and marketing   general and administrative   total expenses    gain from sale of real property loss from operations   other income  net    income loss before income taxes  income taxes net income loss   fiscal years ended september  and revenue revenue decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  revenue attributable to our top ten customers was approximately million less in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the most significant product decreases were in receivers and transmitters 
this reflects slightly softer demand for our products as compared to fiscal we have also experienced pressure for price concessions from customers during the current fiscal year 
we cannot assure you that our decrease in revenue will reverse in future periods  as the average selling prices for existing products may continue to decline in response to product introductions by competitors or us  or other factors  including the reduction of customer demand for our products or pressure from customers for price concessions 
the following table sets forth revenue attributable to each of our product groups as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
fiscal years ended september  receivers transceivers transmitters other revenue cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  gross margin decreased to in the fiscal year ended september  from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in cost of material to as a percentage of revenues from of revenues in fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the most significant component of the increase in material cost was a decrease in inventory used in production in the fiscal year ended september  that was previously written down as excess inventory compared to the fiscal year ended september  the company utilized approximately million of inventory in production during fiscal that had previously been written down to zero  compared to million during fiscal this million decrease in the use of written down inventory is approximately as a percentage of the revenues for the current fiscal year 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this most significant components of the decrease were a decrease in bonus expense of million  in supplies of  and in compensation and benefits of  related to the reduction in the number of employees in research and development 
we do not expect the current year decrease in expense or any potential decrease in expense in fiscal to have a material impact on our ongoing research and development efforts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense 
we believe that investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and these expenses may increase in absolute dollars in the future 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense of  and a decrease in the company s premiums for directors and officers insurance 
our general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of an increase in legal and consulting fees associated with analysis of strategic alternatives that have been undertaken by our management and board of directors 
gain from sale of real property on june   the company sold the building located in chatsworth  california which was its former corporate headquarters and recognized a gain of  the net proceeds from this transaction were approximately million 
other income  net other income  net increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase was due to an increase in investment income as a result of rising interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense was  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to income tax expense of  for the fiscal year ended september  income tax expense for the fiscal year ended september  was comprised of foreign taxes in the amount of  and federal alternative minimum taxes in the amount of  offset by a state income tax benefit of  related to current year estimated liability offset by prior year benefits taken in the current year 
income tax expense for the fiscal year ended september  was comprised of foreign taxes in the amount of  state income taxes in the amount of  and  resulting from an adjustment to prior year s net deferred tax assets

revenue from our largest ten customers increased to million in fiscal year ended september  from million in fiscal year september   or approximately of the increase in absolute dollars 
sales of our products for metropolitan area networks were approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  compared to approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  sales of our products for local area and storage area networks were approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  and for the fiscal year ended september  we do not expect that our rate of year over year growth in revenue will be sustainable in future periods  as the average selling prices for existing products may decline in response to product introductions by competitors or us  or other factors  including the reduction of customer demand for our products or pressure from customers for price concessions 
the following table sets forth revenue attributable to each of our product groups as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
fiscal years ended september  receivers transceivers transmitters other revenue cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase in cost of revenue is mainly due to the increase in sales volume 
gross margin increased to in the fiscal year ended september  from in the same period last year 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a million increase in inventory used in production in the fiscal year ended september  that was previously written down as excess inventory compared to the fiscal year ended september  and a decrease in overhead costs as a percentage of revenue in the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  the company utilized approximately million of inventory in production during fiscal that had previously been written down to zero  compared to million during fiscal research and development research and development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to an increase in engineering supplies resulting from an increase in research and development activities 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase was primarily due to an increase of  in salaries and benefits resulting from additional sales and marketing personnel and an increase of  in commissions paid to our direct sales force and independent manufacturers representatives as a result of increase revenue 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  during the third quarter of  the company repurchased stock from two executives and recorded a million expense associated with this stock repurchase as stock compensation expense 
no stock compensation expense was recorded in fiscal year ended september  in addition  the decrease was due to a decrease in insurance expense primarily related to a decrease in directors and officers insurance premiums and bad debt expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in salaries and benefits resulting from additional personnel hired 
gain from sale of real property on june   the company sold the building located in chatsworth  california which was its former corporate headquarters and recognized a gain of  the net proceeds from this transaction were approximately million 
other income  net other income  net decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was due to a decrease in investment income  which was primarily the result of a decrease in interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense was  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended september  income tax expense for the fiscal year ended september  is comprised of foreign taxes in the amount of  state income taxes in the amount of  and  resulting from an adjustment to prior year s net deferred tax assets 
the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended september  includes a charge of million related to the valuation allowance of certain deferred tax assets and state net operating loss and credit carry forwards 
supplementary data quarterly results the following table sets forth some of our selected financial information for our eight most recently completed fiscal quarters

we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors which could cause our operating results to vary include fluctuations in the demand for and sales of our products  the timing of customer orders  the cancellation of existing orders  competitive factors such as introductions of new products  our ability to develop  introduce and manufacture new products in a timely manner  our ability to control expenses  the availability of components for our products  the mix of our products sold  changes in industry standards and general economic conditions in the communications and related industries 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   our primary source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents balance of million and million of marketable securities  which consist primarily of united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents balance and million in marketable securities 
the total of our cash and cash equivalents balance and our marketable securities balance decreased during the fiscal year primarily due to inventory purchases to support increasing backlog for our product which were partially offset by the increase in accounts payable 
current assets and current liabilities since inception  we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations 
additional financing has been generated through term loans and through our initial public offering of our class a common stock  which we completed on november  as of september   our working capital was million with a current ratio of compared to our working capital of million with a current ratio of as of september  our working capital increased during the fiscal year primarily due to a million increase in inventory and a  decrease in current liabilities 
we believe that additional cash could be borrowed if necessary  however  our current cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities  are expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the next months 
on june   we sold the building located in chatsworth  california which was our former corporate headquarters 
net proceeds from this transaction were approximately million 
in august  we fully repaid our long term debt 
as of september   there is no balance outstanding under our term loan agreement 
cash flows provided by used in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated cash flow information dollars in thousands fiscal year ended september operating activities   investing activities    financing activities  net increase decrease in cash and    cash equivalents cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended september  was primarily the result of a million increase in inventory  particularly in the fourth fiscal quarter  to support a million increase in backlog during the fiscal year 
in addition  the cash flow statement indicates a reduction in accrued bonus of million as we used cash to pay out fiscal based bonuses during fiscal these uses of cash were partially offset by net income and non cash depreciation and amortization of million as well as an increase in accounts payable of million 
cash generated by operating activities during the previous fiscal year ended september  was primarily due to an income tax refund of million 
in the fiscal year ended september   the net loss was offset by non cash depreciation as well as a decrease in inventory and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended september  was primarily related to the maturation and conversion to cash and cash equivalents of marketable securities aggregating to million 
this was partially offset by  for purchases of property  plant and equipment  particularly machinery and equipment for manufacturing and engineering 
the cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was due to million increase in marketable securities resulting from our purchases being greater than the maturities and million in capital expenditures 
this was partially offset by million net proceeds from the sale of the building located in chatsworth  california in the third quarter 
in the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was due to the million cash paid for acquisitions  a million increase in marketable securities and million in capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended september  was from the issuance of stock for the exercise of employee stock options and stock plan purchases 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash used by financing activities was due to million retirement of long term debt  partially offset by  provided by the issuance of common stock for the exercise of employee stock options and stock plan purchases 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash used by financing activities was due to  retirement of long term debt  partially offset by  provided by the issuance of common stock for the exercise of employee stock options and stock plan purchases 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from our historical expenditures 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including o the market acceptance of our products  o the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  o price discounts on our products to our customers  o our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  o the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  o capital improvements to new and existing facilities  o technological advances  o our competitors response to our products  o our pursuit of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  and o our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
at this time we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of future minimum payments due under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at september  other liabilities consists of remaining license payments due 
operating other fiscal year leases liabilities total thereafter total we also have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  equipment and outside services in aggregate of approximately million for fiscal year ending september  in addition  total purchase commitments to related party for fiscal is million 
based on our current operations  we believe that our current cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities  are expected to be sufficient to meet all of the known requirements 
inflation inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by inflation in the future 
other events we have no other events or off balance sheet arrangements to disclose at september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are currently exposed to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and cash equivalents includes million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts 
in addition  we have million invested in marketable securities  which represents investments in united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
as of september   our investment in marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent united states treasury notes and treasury bonds with a maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
maturities on held to maturity marketable debt securities range from three to ten months 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the result would be an annual increase or decrease of interest income of million on our investment portfolio 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk sales to foreign customers are denominated in us dollars and as such we have no foreign currency fluctuation risk
