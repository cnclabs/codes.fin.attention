executive summary and outlook we are a media  marketing services  direct marketing and retail company primarily targeting generation y  the approximately million boys and girls in the united states between the ages of and our business is comprised of two distinct divisions alloy merchandising group and alloy media marketing 
alloy merchandising group consists of the direct marketing and retail stores reportable segments 
alloy media marketing consists of the sponsorship and other activities reportable segment 
our direct marketing segment derives revenues from sales of merchandise to consumers through our catalogs and websites 
our retail stores segment derives revenue primarily from the sale  through delia s retail and outlet stores  of merchandise to consumers 
our sponsorship and other activities segment derives revenue largely from traditional blue chip advertisers that seek to market generation y through our products and services including but not limited to our print publications  websites  and display media boards  as well as through promotional events  product sampling  customer acquisition programs and other marketing programs 
our loss from operations in fiscal was million while our loss from operations in fiscal was million 
our operating loss in fiscal is primarily the result of the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets in our sponsorship and other segment  the losses associated with our delia s retail stores  as reported in our retail stores segment  and increased corporate expenses due to our enlarged business and costs we faced as a result of increased litigation and related matters 
with respect to our direct marketing and retail segments collectively referred to as the merchandising businesses  much of our emphasis in has been placed on deriving synergies from the delia s acquisition purchased in september of during the first half of the fiscal  we ceased the operations of our girlfriends la and old glory catalog businesses  enabling us to remain focused on delia s and alloy as our brands to the generation y girl market and on ccs and dan s comp as our brands to the generation y boy market 
we also relocated the fulfillment and call center activities for the alloy and ccs catalogs from a third party facility to more efficient company owned facilities 
we closed seven delia s retail stores during fiscal  and are now beginning to consider expanding our stores in a more effective and strategic manner 
during the third quarter  we began to realize many of the synergies we expected to result from combining our direct marketing operations with those of delia s  leveraging our combined scale  selling across our combined databases while controlling overall catalog circulation  and consolidating fulfillment operations in delia s hanover  pennsylvania warehouse and westerville  ohio contact center 
we anticipate that we will continue to realize these savings going forward 
we continue to review expansion of our sponsorship and other businesses while also undertaking cost saving opportunities 
in march we acquired insite advertising inc  a national indoor media company  to further extend our marketing reach to include the year old demographic 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal  youth  our youth media and marketing arm  entered into an arrangement with regal cinemedia corporation sm  the media subsidiary of regal entertainment group reg  the largest theatre operator in the world  to establish a multi faceted  targeted marketing channel throughout reg s theatre circuit 
the reg theatre network extends our advertising reach to over million annual theatergoer visits  and marks our further expansion from our youth market foundation into the young adult market 
separately  in an effort to improve earnings in our sponsorship business we have been selectively eliminating positions and reducing other fixed costs  while adding sales specialists in a number of our business units to pursue regional and local sales opportunities 

table of contents a number of key management changes have been made in strategic areas to establish the creative  buying and planning teams necessary to execute the successful selection and presentation of merchandise to gain consumer acceptance 
we have also added a number of individuals in our sponsorship division as a result of acquisitions and other hires 
we believe that these individuals are highly qualified for the positions for which they were hired and bring with them extensive cross functional management skills 
as an overall corporate initiative  we intend to continue pursuing our previously announced exploration of separating our sponsorship and merchandising businesses at an opportune time in the foreseeable future 
we have entered into a letter of agreement with our largest shareholder  mlf investments llc which is controlled by one of our directors  whereby mlf investments has agreed to backstop a contemplated million rights offering of shares of common stock of the merchandise business at a specified exercise price 
by agreeing to backstop this proposed offering  mlf investments has committed to purchasing the unsubscribed portion of such shares 
the letter agreement contemplates an exercise price that would be equivalent to a million pre money valuation on the merchandise business 
as we pursue strategic alternatives for positioning and financing the merchandise business  we believe that the arrangement we have made with mlf investments presents an option 
the company is currently analyzing a number of strategic alternatives for its merchandising business 
no decision has yet been made by the board to proceed with either the separation of the merchandise business or the rights offering  and no determination has yet been made about possible distribution ratios for the potential separation or subscription ratios for the possible rights offering 
in the meantime  the company has decided to redeem its series b preferred stock in exchange for alloy common stock to devote corporate capital to fund retail expansion and other operational requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses  among other things  our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the estimates that required management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below revenue recognition direct marketing revenues are recognized at the time products are shipped to customers  net of any promotional price discounts and an allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based upon our return policy  historical experience and evaluation of current sales and returns trends 
merchandise revenues also include shipping and handling billed to customers 
shipping and handling costs are reflected in selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and approximated million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale  net of any promotional price discounts and an allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based upon our return policy  historical experience and evaluation of current sales and returns trends 
sponsorship revenues consist primarily of advertising provided for third parties in our media properties or via marketing events or programs we execute on an advertiser s behalf 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized  net of the commissions and agency fees  when the underlying advertisement is published  broadcasted or otherwise delivered pursuant to the terms of each arrangement 
delivery of advertising in other media forms is 
table of contents completed either in the form of the display of an impression or based upon the provision of contracted services in connection with the marketing event or program 
in catalog print advertising revenues are recognized as earned pro rata on a monthly basis over the estimated economic life of the catalog 
billings in advance of advertising delivery are deferred until earned 
other revenues consist of book development publishing revenue and other service contracts 
publishing revenues are recognized upon publication of each property 
service revenues are recognized as the contracted services are rendered 
in our advertising placement activities  an analysis of our pricing and collection risk  among other tests  is made to determine whether revenue is reported on a gross or net basis 
catalog costs catalog costs consist of catalog production and mailing costs 
catalog costs are capitalized and charged to expense over the expected future revenue stream  which is principally three to five months from the date the catalogs are mailed 
an estimate of the future sales dollars to be generated from each individual catalog drop is used in our catalog costs policy 
the estimate of future sales is calculated for each catalog drop using historical trends for similar catalog drops mailed in prior periods as well as the overall current sales trend for the catalog brand 
this estimate is compared with the actual sales generated to date for the catalog drop to determine the percentage of total catalog costs to be classified as prepaid on our consolidated balance sheets 
prepaid catalog costs on the consolidated balance sheets and selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income are affected by these estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon our forecasted plans to sell our inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing their valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the amounts that we may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions  trends  or competitive conditions differ from our estimates and expectations 
these estimates affect the balance of inventory on our consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to customer credit issues and bankruptcies 
we provide reserves for these situations based on the evaluation of the aging of our accounts receivable portfolio and a customer by customer analysis of our high risk customers 
our reserves contemplate our historical write offs on receivables  specific customer situations  and the economic environments in which we operate 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment and is dependent upon the overall economic environment and our customer viability 
these estimates affect the balance of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets and selling and marketing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
goodwill and intangible assets prior to february   goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  was being amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future periods to be benefited  ranging from three to five years 
effective february   we adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  and requires these assets to be subject to annual impairments tests 
intangible assets consist of trademarks  mailing lists  customer relationships  noncompetition agreements  websites and marketing rights acquired in connection with our business acquisitions 
trademarks currently have indefinite lives  however  the other identified intangible assets are amortized over their expected benefit periods  ranging from two to eight years 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is designed to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit generally  our reportable segments with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
in addition to the use of an independent valuation firm  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of our reporting units which also may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the economic environment in which we operate 
these estimates affect the balance of goodwill and intangible and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted in  long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal direct marketing revenues 
direct marketing revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in direct marketing revenues for fiscal versus fiscal was due primarily to the decreased sales from our alloy  girlfriends la  old glory  ccs and dan s comp brands 
we ceased the catalog operations of our girlfriends la and old glory brands during the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in revenues in our alloy  ccs and dan s comp brands resulted primarily from a planned decline in the number of catalog pages circulated to prospects outside our database and to non buyers inside our database 
this decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of direct marketing revenues generated from our delia s brand which we acquired in september our results only included months of delia s direct marketing revenue 
retail stores revenues 
retail stores revenues totaled million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the retail stores revenue was generated from the delia s retail stores that were open for all or some portion of fiscal during fiscal  we closed of these retail stores 
as of january   we operated delia s retail stores 
our retail stores were acquired on september  in connection with the delia s acquisition  therefore  our total retail store revenue for fiscal reflects approximately months of retail store revenues  while our total retail store revenue for fiscal reflects a full months 
sponsorship and other activities revenues 
sponsorship and other activities revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sponsorship and other revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in revenue generated from our event marketing and promotional programs and newspaper advertising placement business 
this decrease was partially offset by the sponsorship and other revenues generated by insite  which we acquired in march  and the inclusion of a full year s revenue from ocm  which we had acquired in may cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of the cost of the merchandise sold plus the freight cost to deliver the merchandise to the warehouse and retail stores  together with the direct costs attributable to the sponsorship and advertising programs we provide and the marketing publications we produce 
our cost of revenues increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in cost of revenues was due primarily to a full year s cost of revenues for the cost of merchandise sold by delia s acquired in september  offset partially by decreases in cost of goods sold related to the revenue declines of the alloy  ccs and dan s comp direct marketing brands 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the lower gross margin profile of our retail revenues and the inclusion of a full year of retail revenues in fiscal in addition  gross margins within our sponsorship business units declined due to more competitive market conditions in fiscal  which required us to reduce our margins to win sponsorship business contracts 
total operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of our catalog production and mailing costs  our call centers and fulfillment operations expenses  delia s retail store costs  freight costs to deliver goods to our merchandise customers  compensation of our sales and marketing personnel  marketing costs  and information technology expenses related to the maintenance and marketing of our websites and support for our advertising sales activities 
these selling and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of delia s selling and marketing expenses acquired in september and the inclusion of a full year of ocm s selling and marketing expenses 
table of contents acquired in may  partially offset by decreases resulting from reduced catalog circulation and lower fulfillment costs in our direct marketing segment 
as a percentage of total revenues  our selling and marketing expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal fulfillment expenses  including credit card processing charges  decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the efficiencies that resulted from transferring all of our fulfillment operations for our alloy and ccs units to our delia s in house fulfillment operations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative  finance and management personnel  as well as support services and professional service fees 
these expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the addition of a full year of delia s general and administrative expenses 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was approximately million for fiscal as compared with million for fiscal in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires an annual impairment review of such assets 
the decrease in intangible asset amortization is due to an impairment of long lived assets in fiscal  which in turn decreased amortization expense in fiscal goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment 
operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected in fiscal for the sponsorship and other reporting unit and when considered together with market information publicly available  the valuation of the sponsorship and other reporting unit was unable to support the goodwill balance in the reporting unit 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized since the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill by this amount 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  impairment charges for trademarks of approximately  and  were recognized in the direct marketing segment and the sponsorship and other segment  respectively 
estimates of trademark fair values were determined using the income approach 
impairment of other long lived assets 
we performed an impairment analysis of long lived assets in the sponsorship and other segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal since the carrying amounts of certain groups of assets exceeded their estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge of approximately  was recognized in the sponsorship and other segment 
alloy determined that the carrying amounts of non competition agreements totaling  were impaired 
in addition  an impairment charge of  related to property and equipment was recorded 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges totaled approximately  for fiscal as compared with  for fiscal during fiscal  we made the decision to relocate the operations of our mpm business from santa barbara  california to our principal office in new york  new york and terminated several mpm employees 
as a result  we recognized a restructuring charge in the sponsorship and other segment comprised of severance costs and the write off of leasehold improvements 
the mpm operations were completely relocated to our new york offices during the third quarter of fiscal no additional restructuring charges associated with the mpm relocation are expected to be recognized 
income loss from operations total loss from operations 
our loss from operations was million for fiscal as compared with million for fiscal the increase in operating loss is primarily due to the intangible asset impairment issues discussed previously  the loss from the delia s retail operations over the course of a full year  and increased corporate expenses 
income loss from direct marketing operations 
our income from direct marketing operations was million for fiscal while our loss from direct marketing operations was million for fiscal the transition from direct marketing operating loss to direct marketing operating income is primarily a result of the intangible asset issues recorded in fiscal and the improvement in efficiencies noted previously 

table of contents loss from retail stores operations 
our loss from retail stores operations was million in fiscal while our loss from retail stores operations was million in fiscal our fiscal loss from retail store operations reflects a full year of activity  while our fiscal loss reflects approximately four months of operations as we acquired delia s in september income loss from sponsorship and other activities operations 
our loss from sponsorship and other operations was million for fiscal while our income from sponsorship and other operations was million for fiscal the transition from income to loss from sponsorship and other operations is primarily a result of the goodwill impairment of million recorded in fiscal and a decrease in revenue generated from our event marketing and promotional programs and newspaper advertising placement business 
this decrease was partially offset by the sponsorship and other revenues generated by insite  which we acquired in march and contributed million in revenue  and ocm which we acquired in may interest income expense  net in fiscal  we generated interest income of  and had interest expense of million 
in fiscal  we generated interest income of  and had million of interest expense  primarily related to the issuance in of our convertible senior debentures due august  the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower cash and cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities balances during fiscal and the increase in interest expense  resulted primarily from a full year of interest expense associated with the convertible senior debt 
realized gain loss on marketable securities and write off of investments  net net realized losses on the sales of marketable securities were approximately  in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we wrote off a  minority investment in a private company that was having difficulty funding its operations 
in fiscal  net realized gains on the sales of marketable securities were approximately  in addition  in fiscal  we wrote off  of minority investments in private companies that either declared bankruptcy or ceased operations 
income tax benefit expense in fiscal  we recorded an income tax expense of  due to state income taxes 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax expense of million due to our decision to establish a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset of million 
the valuation allowance was established as a result of increased uncertainty over the realization of the deferred tax asset  in part as a result of the acquisition of delia s

fiscal compared with fiscal revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal direct marketing revenues 
direct marketing revenues decreased to million from million in fiscal revenue from our alloy  girlfriends la  ccs  and dan s comp brands decreased as a result of both a planned decline in catalog circulation following our acquisition of delia s and lower customer response rates to the catalogs we did mail during the second half of the fiscal year due to less desirable merchandise assortments 
we acquired delia s in september primarily to improve catalog circulation productivity by overlaying similar name databases  add a strong  teen focused brand  and capitalize on cost saving opportunities in combining the businesses 
delia s direct marketing revenue from september through the end of fiscal totaled million  which partially offset the decreased sales in our other brands 
retail stores revenues 
retail stores revenues totaled million for fiscal compared with none for fiscal the retail stores revenue was generated solely from delia s retail stores 
we owned no retail stores prior to our acquisition of delia s in september 
table of contents sponsorship and other activities revenues 
sponsorship and other activities revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was the result of three main factors the addition of ocm revenue from the date of its acquisition in may the twelve months of revenue from mpm during fiscal compared with the five and one half months of revenue from mpm during fiscal  and our expanding client base and our strengthened client relationships within our promotional marketing business units 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of the cost of the merchandise sold plus the freight cost to deliver the merchandise to the warehouse and retail stores  together with the direct costs attributable to the sponsorship and advertising programs we provide and the marketing publications we produce 
our cost of revenues increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in cost of revenues was due primarily to the additional costs of goods sold by ocm acquired in may  a full year s cost of revenues for our mpm ad placement business  and the cost of merchandise sold by delia s acquired in september  offset partially by decreases in cost of goods sold related to the revenue declines of the alloy  girlfriends la  ccs and dan s comp direct marketing brands 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the lower gross margin profile of our sponsorship and other revenues as an increased proportion of these revenues were generated from our lower gross margin advertising placement and event and field marketing activities 
in addition  gross margins within our sponsorship business units declined due to more competitive market conditions in fiscal  which required us to reduce our margins to win sponsorship business contracts 
gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods due primarily to the changing revenue contributions of our different sponsorship activities 
total operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of our catalog production and mailing costs  our call centers and fulfillment operations expenses  delia s retail store costs  freight costs to deliver goods to our merchandise customers  compensation of our sales and marketing personnel  marketing costs  and information technology expenses related to the maintenance and marketing of our websites and support for our advertising sales activities 
these selling and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of delia s selling and marketing expenses since september the inclusion of ocm s selling and marketing expenses since its acquisition in may  increased information technology spending to support our expanded advertising sales force  increased occupancy expenses of our expanded advertising sales and execution staff  and the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative  finance and management personnel  as well as support services and professional service fees 
these expenses increased to million in fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily was driven by the addition of ocm s expenses since the acquisition date  the inclusion of delia s expenses since september   the acquisition date  an increase in compensation expense for additional personnel to handle our growing business  the costs of an internal investigation into certain accounting matters  and increased expenses associated with growing a public company such as professional fees  insurance premiums  occupancy costs due to office expansions  and telecommunications costs 
our general and administrative expenses increased to as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to the addition of high general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in the acquired delia s business 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was approximately million for fiscal as compared with million for fiscal in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires an annual impairment review of such assets 
the increase in intangible asset amortization is due to our acquisition activities during the last twelve months and the associated allocation of purchase price to amortizable identified intangible assets 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment 
due to the decline in catalog response rates  operating profit and cash flows were lower than expected during fiscal based on that trend  as well as the addition and integration of delia s  the projected cash flows could not support the goodwill within the direct marketing reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized since the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  an impairment charge for trademarks of million and million was recognized in the direct marketing segment and the sponsorship and other segment  respectively

impairment of other long lived assets 
as a result of triggering events such as the discontinuance of the old glory and girlfriends la catalog brands  we performed an analysis pursuant to sfas no 
of the recoverability of long lived assets in the direct marketing segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of this analysis  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the direct marketing segment 
we determined that the carrying amounts of the non competition agreement of  related to old glory  the website of  related to old glory and the non competition agreement of  related to girlfriends la were impaired as we planned to discontinue marketing our old glory and girlfriends la brands 
in addition  the future cash flows related to dan s comp could not fully support the carrying amount of dan s comp s long lived assets 
as a result  an impairment charge related to the non competition agreement of  property and equipment of  and mailing list of  was recorded 
restructuring charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we made the strategic decision to outsource substantially all of our fulfillment activities for our girlfriends la unit to new roads 
we determined that we would not be able to sublease our existing fulfillment facilities due to real estate market conditions 
as a result  we recognized a first quarter charge of approximately  in our direct marketing segment  representing the future contractual lease payments  severance and personnel costs  and the write off of related leasehold improvements 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we made the strategic decision to transfer substantially all of our call center and fulfillment activities for our alloy and ccs units from new roads  a third party service provider  to our distribution center in hanover  pennsylvania and call center in westerville  ohio 
as a result  we were required to 
table of contents pay new roads an exit fee 
we recognized a charge of approximately  in the third quarter of in our direct marketing segment  representing the contractual exit payment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off an abandoned facility lease and equipment no longer required in our business operations when we determined that we could not exit the lease or sublease the space 
as a result  we took a fourth quarter charge of million 
income loss from operations total income loss from operations 
our loss from operations was million for fiscal while our income from operations was million for fiscal the transition from operating income to operating loss is primarily due to the goodwill impairment  the incurrence of operating losses in our direct marketing business  the loss from the delia s retail operations  increased corporate expenses  and increased depreciation and amortization expenses 
income loss from direct marketing operations 
our loss from direct marketing operations was million for fiscal while our income from direct marketing operations was million for fiscal the transition from direct marketing operating income to direct marketing operating loss was primarily a result of goodwill impairment and lower revenues resulting from reduced catalog circulation and reduced productivity in the catalogs we did circulate 
loss from retail stores operations 
our loss from retail stores operations was million in fiscal the loss was generated from the delia s retail stores acquired in september income from sponsorship and other activities operations 
our income from sponsorship and other operations decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to the increased amortization of acquired intangible assets and the impairment of trademarks 
interest income expense  net in fiscal  we generated interest income of  and million of interest expense  primarily related to the issuance in july and august of our convertible senior debentures due august  in fiscal  we generated interest income of million and had interest expense of  the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower cash and cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities balances during fiscal realized gain loss on marketable securities and write off of investments  net net realized gains on the sales of marketable securities were approximately  in fiscal in addition  we wrote off  of minority investments in private companies that either declared bankruptcy or ceased operations 
realized gains from sales of marketable securities in fiscal were approximately  income tax benefit expense in fiscal  we recorded an income tax expense of million due to our decision to establish a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset of million 
the valuation allowance was established as a result of increased uncertainty over the realization of the deferred tax asset  in part as a result of the acquisition of delia s 
in fiscal  we received an income tax benefit of million due to the release of our valuation reserve in the fourth quarter due to the anticipated likelihood of future profits 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities as we generated negative cash flow from operations with the exception of fiscal and fiscal at january   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our principal commitments at january  consisted of the debentures  redeemable convertible preferred stock  accounts payable  bank loans  accrued expenses and obligations under operating and capital leases 

table of contents we have entered into a letter of agreement with our largest shareholder  mlf investments llc which is controlled by one of our directors  whereby mlf investments has agreed to backstop a contemplated million rights offering of shares of common stock of the merchandise business at a specified exercise price 
by agreeing to backstop this proposed offering  mlf investments has committed to purchasing the unsubscribed portion of such shares 
the letter agreement contemplates an exercise price that would be equivalent to a million pre money valuation on the merchandise business 
as we pursue strategic alternatives for positioning and financing the merchandise business  we believe that the arrangement we have made with mlf investments presents an option 
the company is currently analyzing a number of strategic alternatives for its merchandising business
