the 
table of contents forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
there are a number of important factors that could cause varian semiconductor s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this report and presented by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause varian semiconductor s financial results to differ are described under the heading risk factors 
overview varian semiconductor is the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips 
varian semiconductor designs  manufactures  markets and services semiconductor processing equipment for virtually all of the major semiconductor manufacturers in the world 
the viista ion implanter products are designed to leverage single wafer processing technology for the full range of semiconductor implant applications 
varian semiconductor has shipped over  systems worldwide 
varian semiconductor provides support  training  and after market products and services that help its customers obtain high utilization and productivity  reduce operating costs  and extend capital productivity of investments through multiple product generations 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor was ranked number one in customer satisfaction in vlsi research inc s customer survey for all large suppliers of wafer processing equipment  an honor received in eight of the past nine years 
varian semiconductor s business is cyclical and depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depends on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
in fiscal years and  semiconductor equipment manufacturers experienced a significant contraction in the demand for products due to the slowdown in economies worldwide  specifically the slowdown in technology sectors that utilize integrated circuits 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor experienced an increase in business activity owing to a generally strengthening economy and increased demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductor industry products continued and varian semiconductor s fiscal year revenue increased over fiscal year for fiscal year  varian semiconductor s revenue increased over fiscal year as customers migrate to single wafer systems  which favor varian semiconductor s product offering 
although visibility is significantly limited  varian semiconductor is anticipating a flat global semiconductor equipment market in fiscal year critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates varian semiconductor s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon varian semiconductor s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires varian semiconductor to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continual basis  varian semiconductor evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  accounts receivable  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  deferred revenue  post retirement benefits  contingencies  and foreign currencies 
varian semiconductor operates in a highly cyclical and competitive industry that is influenced by a variety of diverse factors including  but not limited to  technological advances  product life cycles  customer and supplier lead times  and geographic and macroeconomic trends 
estimating product demand beyond a relatively short forecasting horizon is difficult and prone to forecasting error due to the cyclical nature and inherent lack of visibility in the industry 
varian semiconductor bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also the factors discussed in the section titled risk factors 
varian semiconductor believes that the following sets forth the critical accounting policies used by varian semiconductor in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenue includes established products  new products  upgrades and spare parts 
varian semiconductor recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
for established and new products  a portion of the total purchase price is typically not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
for established products  the lesser of the amount allocated to the equipment or the contractual amount due upon delivery is recorded as product revenue upon delivery 
the amount deferred is recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
for new products  revenue allocated to the equipment is recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue related to spare parts and upgrade sales is recognized upon the later of delivery or when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
products are classified as established products if post delivery acceptance provisions and the installation process have been determined to be routine  due to the fact that the acceptance provisions are generally a replication of pre shipment procedures  and there is a demonstrated history of achieving predetermined installation cost targets 
the majority of products are designed and manufactured to meet contractual customer specifications 
to ensure customer specifications are satisfied  the systems are tested at varian semiconductor s manufacturing facility prior to shipment 
to the extent that customers conditions cannot be replicated in varian semiconductor s facilities  or if there is not a demonstrated history of meeting newer customer specifications  then the product is treated as new for revenue recognition purposes 
varian semiconductor has predetermined criteria for changing the classification of a new product to an established product 
a new product must achieve a set number of acceptances and a set target for installation cost 
once the criteria have been achieved for a new product  the product is considered established 
service revenue includes revenue from maintenance and service contracts  extended warranties  paid service and system installation services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
extended warranty revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable warranty term 
revenue related to paid service is recorded when earned and revenue related to installation is recorded upon fulfillment of the service obligation and customer acceptance 
it takes approximately three to six weeks for varian semiconductor technicians to complete the installation of varian semiconductor products and perform tests agreed to with customers 
certain customers formally document their acceptance of varian semiconductor s products at this time 
other customers elect to perform additional internal testing prior to formal acceptance  and this process generally takes eight to twelve weeks 
royalty and license revenue is recognized when contractual obligations are met  and in the case of royalties  upon receipt of a royalty report from the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
when fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recorded when payments become due 
varian semiconductor s transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to all elements  except systems  based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon hourly rates at the estimated time to complete the service 
the fair value of all other elements is based upon the price charged when these amounts are sold separately and unaccompanied by other elements 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts varian semiconductor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to make required payments for products and services 
accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded 
the remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the amount of days the balance is past due  and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history 
if the financial conditions of varian semiconductor s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if accounts previously identified as a risk and reserved for subsequently stabilize  and are deemed to no longer be at risk for collection  or categories past due decrease  the allowance for doubtful accounts may be reduced 
as a result  a reduction to bad debt expense would be recognized in the period the determination was made 
inventory and purchase order commitments varian semiconductor values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the determination of lower of cost or market requires that varian semiconductor make significant assumptions about future demand for products and the transition to new product offerings from legacy products 
estimating product demand beyond a relatively short forecasting horizon is difficult and prone to forecasting error due to the cyclical nature and inherent lack of visibility in the industry 
varian semiconductor also provides for losses on those open purchase order commitments in which varian semiconductor s estimated obligation to receive inventory under the commitments exceeds expected production demand 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  supplier lead time and technological and market obsolescence 
once inventory is written down and a new cost basis has been established  it is not written back up if demand increases 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
if market conditions are more favorable than those projected by management  and specific inventory previously written down is subsequently sold  gross profit would improve by the amount of the specific write down reversed in the period the inventory is sold 
in the case of purchase order commitments  more favorable market conditions or successful negotiations with suppliers will result in a reduction of provisions in the period the excess purchase order commitments are reduced 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and income tax provision the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
on a quarterly basis  varian semiconductor evaluates both the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
varian semiconductor considers future taxable income  ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and the ability to utilize tax losses and credits in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance related to certain state tax credit carryforwards has been recorded 
management has concluded that it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized since historically the annual amount of state credits generated exceeds the amount of credits that can be used 
should varian semiconductor determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its other deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be required resulting in an expense recorded within the provision for income taxes in the statement of income in the period in which such determination was made 
it is possible that the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if future taxable income is reduced 
varian semiconductor s effective tax rate is affected by levels of taxable income in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions  us tax credits generated and utilized for research and development expenditures  us foreign income exclusion  investment tax credits and other tax incentives specific to domestic and foreign operations 
in the normal course of business  varian semiconductor and its subsidiaries are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
the irs has conducted an examination for the tax years through as part of its routine examinations of varian semiconductor s income tax returns 
fieldwork for the examination was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and submitted to the congressional joint committee on taxation joint committee for final approval 
varian semiconductor was 
table of contents notified of joint committee approval in the first quarter of fiscal year varian semiconductor anticipates recording a tax benefit and related interest income in the first half of fiscal year in the range of to million related to the favorable conclusion of this multi year tax examination 
product warranties varian semiconductor provides for the estimated cost of product warranties  the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information  at the time product revenue is recognized 
while varian semiconductor engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies  varian semiconductor s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  utilization levels  material usage  service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to varian semiconductor 
should actual product failure rates  utilization levels  material usage  service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure or supplier warranties on parts differ from varian semiconductor s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
environmental liabilities liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or varian semiconductor s commitment to a formal plan of action 
in situations where the various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate then future costs  the lower limit of an estimated range is accrued on a non discounted basis 
all other liabilities  where varian semiconductor has generally sufficient knowledge to estimate the scope of costs and future activities  are accrued on a discounted basis 
should new information become available and or different assumptions are applied in the estimation of environmental liabilities  revisions to the accrued environmental liability would be required 
results of operations fiscal year varian semiconductor s fiscal year is a or week period that ends on the friday nearest september fiscal year was comprised of a week period ended on september  fiscal year was comprised of a week period ended on october  fiscal year was comprised of a week period ended on october  fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue the following table sets forth total revenue and revenue by revenue stream for fiscal years and fiscal year change percent change amounts in millions product service royalty and license total revenue product during fiscal year  varian semiconductor believes that the overall market for systems declined by about compared to fiscal year however  varian semiconductor s product sales increased by 
the 
table of contents increase was due to a unit increase in system sales of  a shift towards viista systems  which typically have higher selling prices than legacy systems  and an increase in sales of parts and upgrades 
varian semiconductor believes that market share gains  particularly in the high current sector  and a shift in industry spending toward memory manufacturers  were the primary reasons for varian semiconductor s increase in sales versus the overall market for ion implanters and related products 
service the increase in service revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year is primarily the result of an increase in the number of system installations 
system installation revenues increased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year service contract revenues also increased by million  primarily as a result of sales of service contracts with new systems 
generally  installation revenue is influenced by shipment volume of systems  product mix  customer mix  and timing of customer acceptance 
in addition  as products mature and installations require less effort to complete  the fair value of installation revenue decreases and product revenue simultaneously increases 
royalty and license as a result of an arbitration panel ruling in the second phase of the arbitration between varian semiconductor and applied materials  varian semiconductor received payments of million during the first quarter of fiscal year for past due royalties and interest 
applied materials is also required to make quarterly unit based royalties payments to varian semiconductor on future sales of certain products found to be within the scope of the patent license agreement the agreement through the expiration of the agreement in march of the total million received in fiscal year from applied materials  varian semiconductor recognized million during fiscal year as interest income and the remaining million as royalty revenue 
pursuant to the terms of a settlement and license agreement between lam and varian semiconductor  lam was required to make quarterly cash payments of million through the first quarter of fiscal year for future use of the patents 
these quarterly cash payments were recognized as revenue in fiscal years  and customers revenue from varian semiconductor s ten largest customers in fiscal years and accounted for approximately and of revenue  respectively 
varian semiconductor expects that sales of its products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of its revenue in the foreseeable future 
in fiscal year  revenue from two customers accounted for and of varian semiconductor s total revenue 
in fiscal year  revenue from two customers accounted for and of varian semiconductor s total revenue 
fluctuations in the timing and mix of product shipments  customer requirements for systems  and the completion of the installation of the product will continue to have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in any given period see also risk factors and critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  compared to the cost of product revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year gross margin decreased in fiscal year due to less favorable factory overhead absorption  as well as higher levels of field support  distribution and inventory related costs associated with the larger installed base of systems in new fabs 
the decrease in gross margin was offset slightly by increased sales of parts and upgrades  which traditionally have higher margins than sales of other products 
cost of product revenue in fiscal years and was favorably impacted by million and million  respectively  from the sale of certain inventory for which the carrying value had been reduced in previous periods 

table of contents cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  compared to million and gross margin of for fiscal year the increase in cost of service for fiscal year was due to an increase in the number of installations completed 
further  the increase in service gross margin in fiscal year was a result of improved installation profitability primarily due to the timing and mix of completed installations 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in research and development spending is attributable to varian semiconductor s rapid development cycle and continuing efforts to improve productivity and technical development of its products 
the year over year increase was a result of increased labor and material spending associated with the development of new products  particularly new generation high current implanters 
in addition to developing new high current products  varian semiconductor continues to focus on maintaining its leadership position in the market for medium current implanters 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses was the result of increased marketing expenses related to the customer evaluations and demonstration of new generation products and increases in the cost of variable compensation programs that partially fluctuate with profitability  as well as increased legal expenses associated with patent enforcement actions 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal years and were favorably impacted by million and million  respectively  of collected trade accounts receivable that were previously included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  the first quarter of fiscal year included a million charge  largely non cash  associated with the retirement of the president and chief operating officer of varian semiconductor 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized million in restructuring costs 
the restructuring costs related to reductions in headcount and facilities in europe 
there were no restructuring costs recognized during fiscal year during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized approximately million in restructuring costs 
the fiscal year restructuring costs related to a reduction in headcount of approximately employees and were primarily severance related 
the majority of the restructuring reserve balance of million as of september   is expected to be paid during fiscal year below is a table summarizing the restructuring reserve activity included in accrued expenses on the balance sheet for fiscal years and reduction in work force facility closures other total amounts in thousands balance as of october  cash payments balance as of october  new charges cash payments balance as of september  interest income and interest expense 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor earned million in net interest income  compared to million for fiscal year interest income increased partially due to the million related to past due royalties from applied materials as a result of an arbitration ruling 
the remaining increase is due to higher cash balances and rates  along with an increased portfolio of investments 
other income expense  net 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded other income of million  primarily related to the reduction of an estimated loss contingency of million associated with patent 
table of contents infringement and antitrust litigation 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded an expense of million primarily related to the cancellation of capital projects 
other income expense  net also includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal year and in fiscal year the rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate in fiscal years and  principally due to credits and lower taxed foreign income 
future tax rates may vary from these historic rates depending on the worldwide composition of earnings and the continuing availability of income tax credits  as well as the potential resolution of tax contingencies 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca phases out the benefits from the extraterritorial exclusion in fiscal years and  and provides a new deduction for income from domestic production activities 
this deduction will become effective for varian semiconductor in fiscal year the ajca also creates a temporary incentive for us companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an elective dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
varian semiconductor completed its evaluation of the foreign repatriation provisions and decided not to repatriate foreign earnings under these provisions as it would not be beneficial to varian semiconductor 
the irs completed fieldwork for a multi year tax examination of varian semiconductor in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and submitted its report to the joint committee for final approval 
varian semiconductor was notified of joint committee approval in the first quarter of fiscal year varian semiconductor anticipates recording a tax benefit and related interest income in the first half of fiscal year in the range of to million related to the conclusion of the examination 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  for fiscal year varian semiconductor recorded net income of million  compared to net income of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year  compared to net income per diluted share of for fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue the following table sets forth total revenue and revenue by revenue stream for fiscal years and fiscal year change percent change amounts in thousands product service royalty and license total revenue product increased customer demand for single wafer ion implanters  parts and upgrades contributed to the increase in product revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year typically  viista systems have higher selling prices than legacy systems 
varian semiconductor believes that market share gains  particularly in the high current sector  and a shift in industry spending toward memory manufacturers  were the primary reason for varian semiconductor s increase in sales versus the overall market for ion implanters and related products 
service service revenue declined in fiscal year from fiscal year due to lower installation revenue 
although the number of completed installations increased by in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  
table of contents the average fair value of the completed installations declined 
furthermore  revenue in fiscal year increased toward the end of the fiscal year  thus  some installations related to the shipments were not complete until the beginning of fiscal year installation revenue is influenced by shipment volume of systems  product mix and customer mix  and timing of customer acceptance 
as described in our revenue recognition policy note  fair value allocated to installations is based upon hourly rates applied to the estimated time to complete the service 
the fair value of our completed installations declined because  as we gain experience with a product  we become more efficient in performing installations of that product 
royalty and license pursuant to the terms of a settlement and license agreement between varian semiconductor and lam  varian semiconductor received  during the first quarter of fiscal year  a warrant to purchase  shares of lam common stock at per share and a million cash payment in exchange for prior use of certain varian semiconductor patents 
total royalty and license revenue recognized from lam during the first quarter of fiscal year included the warrant  which was valued at million  and the million cash payment 
lam was required to make quarterly cash payments of million through december for future use of the patents 
these quarterly cash payments were recognized as revenue in fiscal years  and customers revenue from varian semiconductor s ten largest customers in fiscal years and accounted for approximately and of revenue  respectively 
varian semiconductor expects that sales of its products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of its revenue in the foreseeable future 
in fiscal year  revenue from two customers accounted for and of varian semiconductor s total revenue 
in fiscal year  revenue from two customers accounted for and of varian semiconductor s total revenue 
fluctuations in the timing and mix of product shipments  customer requirements for systems  and the completion of the installation of the product will continue to have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue in any given period see also risk factors and critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  compared to the cost of product revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year more efficient factory operations  primarily related to overhead absorption and supply chain operations  principally due to increased customer demand  increased gross profit by million compared to the same period a year ago 
in addition  the increased volume of parts and upgrades sales favorably impacted gross profit by million compared to the same period a year ago 
gross profit was favorably affected in fiscal year by million from the sale of certain inventory for which the carrying value had been reduced in previous periods and from the reduction of adverse inventory purchase commitments 
varian semiconductor has historically  and may in the future  sustain inventory related charges resulting from numerous factors  including changes in customers purchase commitments  changes in commitments to varian semiconductor s vendors  technology changes and varian semiconductor s manufacturing lead times 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  and gross margins were and for each period  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin for cost of service revenue in fiscal year was a result of less installation revenue  partially offset by higher paid service gross margins 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of increased labor and material spending associated with the development of new products  particularly new generation high current implanters 
varian semiconductor intends to continue its investment in research and development 

table of contents marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
the increase in expenses was the result of marketing costs related to higher revenue volume and the demonstration of new generation products  increases in the cost of variable compensation programs that partially fluctuate with profitability and legal expenses associated with patent enforcement actions 
varian semiconductor has continued to improve its accounts receivable collections experience 
as a result  million and million of customer accounts receivables were collected in fiscal years and  respectively  that were previously included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
restructuring costs 
there were no restructuring costs during fiscal year during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized approximately million in restructuring costs 
the restructuring costs related to a reduction in headcount of approximately employees and were primarily severance related 
the majority of the restructuring reserve balance of million as of october  was paid during fiscal year below is a table summarizing the restructuring reserve activity in fiscal years and reduction in work force facility closures other total amounts in thousands balance as of september  new charges cash payments balance as of october  cash payments balance as of october  interest income and interest expense 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor earned million in net interest income  compared to million for fiscal year interest income increased due to higher cash and investment balances  an increased portion of longer term investments  and higher interest rates 
interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from a full year s payments on mortgage debt assumed as part of the purchase in february of varian semiconductor s newburyport  massachusetts facility 
other income expense  net 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded costs in other expense of million primarily related to the cancellation of capital projects 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded a net loss in other expense of million 
other expense  net  primarily relates to foreign exchange gains and losses 
provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal year and in fiscal year the rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate in fiscal years and principally due to credits and lower taxed foreign income 
future tax rates may vary from these historic rates depending on the worldwide composition of earnings and the continuing availability of income tax credits as well as the potential resolution of tax contingencies 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  for fiscal year varian semiconductor recorded net income of million  compared to net income of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year  compared to net income per diluted share of for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources varian semiconductor generated million of cash from operations during fiscal year  compared to million during fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal year was derived primarily 
table of contents from net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  the tax benefit from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan issuances of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and a decrease in other current assets of million 
the cash flow effects of net income  non cash items and the changes in accrued expenses and other current assets were partially offset by increases in inventory of million 
increases in inventory were due to increased customer evaluation systems and field inventory primarily for new customers 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operations was derived primarily from net income of million  and increases in deferred revenue of million  depreciation and amortization of million and accounts payable of million 
the cash flow effects of net income and the increases in deferred revenue  depreciation and amortization and accounts payable were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
the increase in accounts receivable and inventory were directly related to the significant increase in demand for semiconductor products during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  varian semiconductor used million for the net purchase of short term investments and million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor used million for the net purchase of short term investments and million of cash for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor generated million of cash from financing activities  primarily due to the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options and under the employee stock purchase plan of million  partially offset by repayments of short and long term borrowings 
during fiscal year  million of cash was generated by financing activities  primarily due to million from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayments of short and long term borrowings 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of varian semiconductor s common stock from time to time on the open market 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor repurchased  shares at a weighted average price per share of 
varian semiconductor s liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on the normal operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
varian semiconductor believes that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at september  will be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements  commitments for capital expenditures  any future common stock repurchases and other purchase commitments  environmental contingencies and cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements varian semiconductor does not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  varian semiconductor is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if varian semiconductor had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents contractual obligations under gaap  some obligations and commitments are not required to be included in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on liquidity 
other than the principal portion of the loan payments  which is included in the balance sheet  the following commitments as of september  have not been included in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income included under
