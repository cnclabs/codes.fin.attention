as a consequence  current plans  anticipated actions and future financial condition and results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of sunlink 
you are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this form k 
we have not undertaken any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
risk factors relating to an investment in sunlink in addition to other information contained in this annual report  including certain cautionary and forward looking statements  you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating an investment in sunlink sunlink has a limited operating history in the community hospital business and a limited history of profitability 
prior to february   sunlink operated in different business segments 
while sunlink had income from continuing operations of  for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june   sunlink had a loss from continuing operations of  for the fiscal year ended june   a loss from continuing operations of  for the fiscal year ended june   a loss of for the three month transitional period ended june   a loss from continuing operations of for the fiscal year ended march   and a loss from continuing operations of for the fiscal year ended march  sunlink may experience operating losses from continuing operations in the future 
sunlink s growth strategy depends in part on making successful acquisitions via mergers or otherwise which may expose sunlink to new liabilities 
as part of its growth strategy  sunlink will seek further growth through acquisitions  via mergers or otherwise  of community hospitals to stay competitive with its increasingly larger competitors or to enhance its position in its core areas of operation 
this strategy entails risks that could negatively affect sunlink s results of operations or financial condition 
these risks include unidentified liabilities of the companies sunlink may acquire or merge with  the possible inability to successfully integrate and manage acquired operations and personnel  the potential failure to achieve the economies of scale or synergies sought  and the diversion of management s attention away from other ongoing business concerns 
acquired businesses may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations 
although sunlink has policies which require acquired facilities to implement sunlink compliance standards  and generally will seek indemnification from prospective sellers covering these matters  sunlink may become liable for past activities of acquired businesses 
significant capital investments may be required to achieve sunlink s operational and growth plans  which may affect sunlink s competitive position  reduce earnings  and negatively affect the value of your sunlink common stock 
sunlink s growth plans require significant capital investments 
significant capital investments are required for on going and planned capital improvements at existing hospitals and may be required in connection with future capital projects either in connection with existing properties or future acquired properties 
sunlink s 
index to financial statements ability to make capital investments depends on numerous factors such as the availability of funds from operations and its credit facility and access to additional debt and equity financing 
no assurance can be given that the necessary funds will be available 
moreover  incurrence of additional debt financing  if available  may involve additional restrictive covenants that could negatively affect sunlink s ability to operate its business in the desired manner  and raising additional equity may be dilutive to shareholders 
the failure to obtain funds necessary for the realization of sunlink s growth plans could prevent sunlink from realizing its growth strategy and  in particular  could force sunlink to forego acquisition opportunities that may arise in the future 
this could  in turn  have a negative impact on sunlink s competitive position 
one element of sunlink s business strategy is expansion through the selective acquisitions of community hospitals in selected markets 
the competition to acquire hospitals in the markets that sunlink targets is significant  and sunlink may not be able to make suitable acquisitions on terms favorable to it if other health care companies  including those with greater financial resources  are competing for the same businesses 
in order to make future acquisitions sunlink may be required to incur or assume additional indebtedness 
sunlink may not be able to obtain financing  if necessary  for any acquisitions that it might desire to make or it might be required to borrow at higher rates and on less favorable terms than its competitors 
many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting sales  leases or other transactions in which control of not for profit hospitals is acquired by for profit corporations 
these laws  in general  include provisions relating to state attorney general approval  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  state attorneys general in states without specific legislation governing these transactions may exercise authority based upon charitable trust and other existing law 
the increased legal and regulatory review of these transactions involving the change of control of not for profit entities may increase the costs required  or limit sunlink s ability  to acquire not for profit hospitals 
sunlink s success depends on its ability to maintain good relationships with the physicians at its hospitals and  if sunlink is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  admissions at sunlink hospitals may decrease and sunlink s operating performance could decline 
because physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions and outpatient services  sunlink s success is  in part  dependent upon the number and quality of physicians on the medical staffs of its hospitals  the admissions and referrals practices of the physicians at its hospitals  and its ability to maintain good relations with its physicians 
physicians at sunlink hospitals are generally not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and  in many of the markets that sunlink serves  most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to sunlink s hospitals 
if sunlink is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  admissions at sunlink hospitals may decrease and sunlink s operating performance could decline 
sunlink depends heavily on its senior and local management personnel  and the loss of the services of one or more of sunlink s key senior management personnel or sunlink s key local management personnel could weaken sunlink s management team and its ability to deliver health care services 
sunlink has been  and will continue to be  dependent upon the services and management experience of its executive officers 
if any of sunlink s executive officers were to resign their positions or otherwise be unable to serve  sunlink s management could be weakened and operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  sunlink s success depends on its ability to attract and retain managers at its hospitals and related facilities  on the ability of hospital based officers and key employees to manage growth successfully  and on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
sunlink has not had any material difficulties in attracting senior or local management and  to its knowledge  no key personnel intend to retire or terminate their employment with sunlink in the near future  however  if sunlink is unable to attract and retain affective local management  sunlink s operating performance could decline 

index to financial statements sunlink s success depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified health care professionals  and a shortage of qualified health care professionals in certain markets could weaken our ability to deliver health care services 
in addition to the physicians and management personnel whom sunlink employs  sunlink s operations are dependent on the efforts  ability  and experience of other health care professionals  such as nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians 
nurses  pharmacists  lab technicians and other health care professionals are generally employees of each individual sunlink hospital 
sunlink s success has been  and will continue to be  influenced by its ability to attract and retain these skilled employees 
a shortage of healthcare professionals in certain markets  the loss of some or all of its key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified health care professionals could cause sunlink s operating performance to decline 
while sunlink has experienced occasional delays in the hiring of nurses  pharmacists  certain medical technicians and other healthcare professionals  or in obtaining healthcare professionals with the optimum level of experience or training desired  the material shortages that certain healthcare providers have faced in some markets  particularly in urban areas  to date have not been present in the community hospital markets served by sunlink 
accordingly  sunlink  as yet  has not had material difficulty in attracting required healthcare professionals 
a significant portion of sunlink s revenue is dependent on medicare and medicaid payments  and possible reductions in medicare or medicaid payments or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements may reduce our revenues 
a significant portion of sunlink s revenues are derived from the medicare and medicaid programs  which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
sunlink derived approximately of its patient days and of its net patient revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs for the year ended june  previous legislative changes  including those enacted as part of the balanced budget act of  have resulted in  and future legislative changes may result in  limitations on and reduced levels of payment and reimbursement for a substantial portion of hospital procedures and costs 
future health care legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental health care programs may have a material adverse effect on sunlink s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
revenue and profitability may be constrained by future cost containment initiatives undertaken by purchasers of health care services if sunlink is unable to contain costs 
sunlink derived approximately of its net patient revenues for the fiscal year ended june  from private payors and other non governmental sources who contributed approximately of sunlink s patient days 
sunlink s hospitals have been affected by the increasing number of initiatives undertaken during the past several years by all major purchasers of health care  including in addition to federal and state governments insurance companies and employers  to revise payment methodologies and monitor health care expenditures in order to contain health care costs 
as a result of these initiatives  managed care organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services packages represent an increasing portion of sunlink s admissions  resulting in reduced hospital revenue growth nationwide 
in addition  private payers increasingly are attempting to control health care costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis  increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  referred to as ppos 
if sunlink is unable to contain costs through increased operational efficiencies and the trend toward declining reimbursements and payments continues  the results of its operations and cash flow will be adversely affected 
sunlink s revenues are heavily concentrated in georgia which will make sunlink particularly sensitive to economic and other changes in the state of georgia 
for the fiscal year ended june   our three georgia hospitals generated approximately of revenues for the year 
accordingly  any change in the current demographic  economic  competitive or regulatory 
index to financial statements conditions in the state of georgia could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects of sunlink 
sunlink faces intense competition from other hospitals and health care providers which directly affect our revenues  profitability and market share 
although each of our hospitals operates in communities where they are currently the only general  acute care hospital  they do face competition from other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers 
although these competing hospitals may be as far as to miles away  patients in these markets may migrate to these competing facilities as a result of local physician referrals  managed care plan incentives or personal choice 
the health care business is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
each of our hospitals operates in geographic areas where they compete with at least one other hospital that provides services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
some of these competing facilities offer services  including extensive medical research and medical education programs  which are not offered by sunlink s facilities 
some of the competing hospitals are owned or operated by tax supported governmental bodies or by private not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions which can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis and are exempt from sales  property  and income taxes 
in some of these markets  sunlink s hospitals also face competition from for profit hospital companies which have substantially greater resources as well as other providers such as outpatient surgery and diagnostic centers 
the intense competition from other hospitals and other health care providers directly affects sunlink s revenues  profitability and market share 
sunlink conducts business in a heavily regulated industry  changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce revenue and profitability 
the health care industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  addition of facilities and services  confidentiality  maintenance  and security issues associated with medical records  billing for services  and prices for services 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex and  in many instances  the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations  including in particular  medicare and medicaid antifraud and abuse amendments  codified in section b b of the social security act and known as the anti kickback statute 
this law prohibits providers and others from soliciting  receiving  offering or paying  directly or indirectly  any remuneration with the intent to generate referrals of orders for services or items reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  and other federal health care programs 
as authorized by congress  the united states department of health and human services  or hhs  has issued regulations which describe some of the conduct and business relationships immune from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
the fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within one of these safe harbor provisions does not render the arrangement illegal 
however  business arrangements of health care service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria risk increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 

index to financial statements we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals 
we have contracts with physicians providing services under a variety of financial arrangements such as employment contracts and professional service agreements 
we also provide financial incentives  including loans and minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws to include all health care services  whether or not they are reimbursed under a federal program 
in addition  provisions of the social security act  known as the stark act  also prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services in which the physicians or their immediate family members have an ownership interest or certain other financial arrangements 
in addition  sunlink s facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  which vary by state and could impose additional penalties 
in recent years  both federal and state government agencies have announced plans for or implemented heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts 
government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing health care laws could assert that sunlink or any of the transactions in which the company or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved  are in violation of these laws 
it is also possible that these laws ultimately could be interpreted by the courts in a manner that is different from the interpretations made by each company 
a determination that either sunlink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved in a transaction that violated these laws  or the public announcement that sunlink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is being investigated for possible violations of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on sunlink s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and sunlink s business reputation could suffer significantly 
the laws  rules  and regulations described above are complex and subject to interpretation 
in the event of a determination that we are in violation of any of these laws  rules or regulations  or if further changes in the regulatory framework occur  our results of operations could be significantly harmed 
sunlink s hospitals and other health care facilities are subject to  and depend on  certificate of need laws which could affect their ability to operate profitably 
all states in which sunlink currently owns hospitals have laws affecting acute care hospital facilities and services known as certificate of need laws 
these states require prior approval for the acquisition of major medical equipment or the purchase  lease  construction  expansion  sale or closure of health care facilities  based on determination of need for additional or expanded facilities or services 
the required approval is known generally as a certificate of need or con 
a con may be required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
the failure to obtain any required con may impair sunlink s ability to operate profitably 
in addition  the elimination or modification of con laws in states in which sunlink owns or in the future may own hospitals could subject its hospitals to greater competition making it more difficult to operate profitably 
sunlink could be subject to claims related to discontinued operations and hospitals sold by our healthmont subsidiary prior to its acquisition 
over the past sixteen years  sunlink has discontinued operations carried on by its former industrial  uk leisure marine  life sciences and engineering  and uk child safety segments  as well as our uk housewares segment 
prior to our acquisition of our healthmont subsidiaries  healthmont had sold two hospitals and it also disposed of one additional hospital as a condition to our acquisition of healthmont 
we also have disposed of one of our original hospitals 
sunlink s reserves relating to discontinued operations represent management s best 
index to financial statements estimate of possible liability for property  product liability  and other claims for which sunlink may incur liability 
these estimates are based on management s judgments using currently available information as well as  in certain instances  consultation with sunlink s insurance carriers and legal counsel 
sunlink historically has purchased insurance policies to reduce certain product liability exposure and anticipates it will continue to purchase such insurance if available at commercially reasonable rates 
while estimates have been based on the evaluation of available information  it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of many contingencies relating to discontinued operations 
furthermore  future events or evaluations could cause us to adjust existing reserves in connection with its operations 
sunlink intends to adjust its estimates of required reserves from time to time as additional information is developed and evaluated 
however  sunlink believes that the final resolution of known contingencies will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
we are subject to potential claims for professional liability  including claims based on the acts or omissions of third parties  which claims may not be covered by insurance 
we are subject to potential claims for professional liability medical malpractice  both in connection with our current operations  as well as acquired operations 
to cover these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts that we believe are sufficient for our operations  although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect 
the assertion of a significant number of claims  either within our self insured retention deductible or individually or in the aggregate in excess of available insurance  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
premiums for professional liability insurance have increased substantially in recent times and we can not assure you that professional liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the operations of our hospitals also depend on the professional services of physicians and other trained health care providers and technicians in the conduct of their respective operations  including independent laboratories and physicians rendering diagnostic and medical services 
there can be no assurance that any legal action stemming from the act or omission of a third party provider of health care services  would not be brought against one of our hospitals or sunlink  resulting in significant legal expenses in order to defend against such legal action or to obtain a financial contribution from the third party whose acts or omissions occasioned the legal action 
sunlink may issue additional equity in the future which could dilute the value of shares of existing shareholders 
sunlink s working capital is limited to cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our  credit facility of which approximately  is available to borrow at june  and its additional debt capacity is limited 
management and the board of directors of sunlink periodically have discussed the need to raise equity in the future and periodically have considered certain transactions which might be available to sunlink to raise equity 
however  sunlink has not engaged any underwriter or placement agent with respect to any potential equity offering  nor has sunlink s management made any specific proposal or recommendation to the sunlink board of directors with respect to the type of securities to be offered or of the price at which any securities might be offered 
such transactions might include one or more of the sale of common shares to outsiders  the offer to existing shareholders of the right to acquire additional shares  or the reduction in the exercise price of sunlink s outstanding warrants to a level and on terms that would be expected to result in their immediate exercise 
while the board of directors has not decided to effect any of these transactions at this time  it may do so in the future 
any of these transactions could result in dilution in the value of existing shares 
forward looking statements in this annual report may prove inaccurate 
this document contains forward looking statements about sunlink that are not historical facts but  rather  are statements about future expectations 
forward looking statements in this document are based on 
index to financial statements management s current views and assumptions and may be influenced by factors that could cause actual results  performance or events to be materially different from those projected 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
important factors  some of which are beyond the control of sunlink  could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
these factors include those described above under risk factors and elsewhere in this report under forward looking statements 
corporate business strategy since  our business strategy has focused on the acquisition and operation of community hospitals in the united states 
on february   sunlink purchased five community hospitals  leasehold rights for a sixth existing hospital and the related businesses of all six hospitals for approximately  in october  we acquired two additional hospitals through our acquisition of healthmont  inc in june  we sold our mountainside medical center  a bed hospital located in jasper  ga for approximately  through our subsidiaries  we currently operate a total of seven community hospitals in four states 
currently six of the hospitals are owned and one is leased 
our primary operational strategy is to improve the profitability of our hospitals by reducing out migration of patients  recruiting physicians  expanding services and implementing and maintaining effective cost controls 
our efforts are focused on internal growth 
however  we actively seek to supplement internal growth through acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy is to selectively acquire community hospitals with net revenues of approximately  or more which are the sole or primary hospital in market areas with a population of greater than  or a principal healthcare provider with substantial market share in communities with a population of  to  we believe all of our seven existing hospitals meet at least one of these two market area criteria 
the company considers recent prices paid by others for certain hospital acquisitions to be higher than we would seek to pay but believes there may be opportunities for acquisitions of individual hospitals particularly not for profit hospitals in the future due to  among other things  negative trends in certain government reimbursement programs and other factors 
from time to time we may consider hospitals for disposition if we determine their operating results or potential growth no longer meet our strategic objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates in january  the sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with little or no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as accounting policies critical to us management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve reserves for adjustments to net patient service revenues  evaluation of the recoverability of assets  including accounts receivable  and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  including income taxes and related tax asset valuation allowances  all as discussed in more detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

index to financial statements net patient service revenues we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments at amounts different from established charges 
payment arrangements vary and include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
our patient service revenues are reported as services are rendered at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others 
estimated net realizable amounts are estimated based upon contracts with third party payors  published reimbursement rates and historical reimbursements percentages pertaining to each payor type 
estimated reductions in revenues to reflect agreements with third party payors and estimated retroactive adjustments under such reimbursement agreements are accrued during the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as interim and final settlements are determined 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to accrue such revenue deductions 
at june   there were no material claims or disputes with third party payors 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of sunlink s receivables result from providing healthcare services to patients 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts estimated to become uncollectible in the future 
the company calculates an allowance percentage based generally upon its historical collection experience for each type of payor 
the allowance amount is computed by applying allowance percentages to receivable amounts included in specific payor categories 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are written off after all collection efforts have failed  normally within six months of billing 
risk management we are exposed to various risks of loss from medical malpractice and other claims and casualties  theft of  damage to  and destruction of assets  business interruption  errors and omissions  employee injuries and illnesses  natural disasters including earthquakes  and employee health  dental and accident benefits 
commercial insurance coverage is purchased for a portion of claims arising from such matters 
when  in our judgment  claims are sufficiently identified  a liability is accrued for estimated costs and losses under such claims 
in connection with the acquisition of the original six hospitals  we assumed responsibility for professional liability claims reported after the february  acquisition date and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims prior to the acquisition date 
we purchased claims made commercial insurance for acts prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february   but reported after february   and for claims incurred after february  these amounts are based on actuarially determined amounts 
on june  we sold mountainside medical center  one of our initial six hospitals  but retained all liabilities and obligations arising from mountainside s operations prior to its sale and purchased a year  claims made  extended discovery period tail policy for professional liability 
by virtue of our acquisition of healthmont and its two hospitals  we assumed responsibility for all professional liability claims for which healthmont was  or is  liable 
healthmont had purchased claims made commercial insurance for claims made prior to our acquisition and we have purchased claims made commercial insurance for claims made after the acquisition 
sunlink secured a claims made  extended discovery period tail policy with respect to healthmont s existing directors  officers and employment practices liability insurance policy for a term through august  because sunlink assumed responsibility for existing general and professional liability claims and claims reported after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of liability for claims assumed at the acquisition and for claims incurred after the acquisition 
these amounts are based on actuarially determined amounts 
we self insure for workers compensation and employee health risks 
the estimated liability for workers compensation and employee health risks includes estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
we accrue an estimate of losses resulting from workers compensation  employee health and professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
these accruals are estimated quarterly based upon management s review of claims reported and historical loss data 

index to financial statements we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation if it is probable a loss has been incurred and accrue the most likely amount of loss based on the information available 
if no amount within the range of losses estimated from the information available is more likely than any other amount in the range of loss  the minimum amount in the range of loss is accrued 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
goodwill and other intangibles sunlink accounts for goodwill and intangible assets from business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased 
sfas no 
recognizes that goodwill has an indefinite life and is not subject to periodic amortization 
however  goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment  using a fair value methodology  in lieu of amortization 
definite lived intangible assets  such as certificates of need  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from to years 
sunlink continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of intangible assets and they are tested for impairment as conditions warrant according to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences 
sfas no 
generally requires consideration of all expected future events other than proposed enactments of changes in the income tax law or rates 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for share options issued to employees using the intrinsic value based method of accounting 
effective july   the company will adopt sfas no 
r share based payment which will require measuring compensation cost for share options using a fair value based method for employee stock options issued after and for non vested employee stock options outstanding at the adoption date 
financial summary the results of continuing operations shown in the historical summary below are for our us community hospital operations which is composed of five facilities acquired february  shl facilities and two healthmont facilities acquired october  healthmont facilities 
years ended june  net revenues cost of patient service revenues operating profit interest expense interest income loss on early repayment of debt merger expenses earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes admissions equivalent admissions surgeries revenue per equivalent admission 
index to financial statements equivalent admissions equivalent admissions is used by management and certain investors as a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions inpatient volume by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
the equivalent admissions computation is intended to relate outpatient revenues to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume to result in a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume equivalent admissions 
results of operations all of our net revenues are from our us community hospital segment 
the operations of sunlink s former mountainside medical center which was operated during these periods is reported in discontinued operations for all periods discussed 
net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was due to a increase in equivalent admissions and a increase in surgeries 
net outpatient service revenues increased  a increase from last year to  and increased to of net revenues from last year 
the increase in net outpatient service revenues resulted from an increase in outpatient surgeries in the year ended june  compared to the prior year and one hospital which increased its outpatient net revenues by of its net revenues during the current year due to increased laboratory procedures 
net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was due to a increase in equivalent admissions primarily as a result of the acquisition of the two healthmont facilities on october  excluding our two healthmont facilities  net revenues increased from a increase in equivalent admissions  a increase in admissions and a increase in surgeries 
the two healthmont facilities had lower net revenues per equivalent admission in the year ended june  as their operations have underperformed in comparison to our shl facilities 
net outpatient service revenues increased  to  for fiscal  but decreased to of net revenues from in fiscal the decrease in net outpatient service revenues as a percentage of net revenues resulted from relatively lower outpatient revenues at our two healthmont facilities 
recruitment of new doctors and spending for capital improvements have contributed greatly to the increase in net revenues in the years ended june   and  respectively 
we added six net new doctors during the year ended june   net new doctors during the year ended june  not including the doctors added in the healthmont acquisition and net new doctors during the year ended june  during the year ended june   sunlink spent  on physician guarantees and recruiting expenses compared to  last year 
we also have expended approximately  for capital expenditures to upgrade services and facilities since july  we believe the upgraded services and facilities and the new doctors contributed to the increase in net revenues  admissions  equivalent admissions and surgeries for the years ended june  and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
we continue to seek increased patient volume by attracting additional physicians to our hospitals  further upgrading the services offered by the hospitals and improving the hospitals physical facilities 

index to financial statements the following table sets forth the percentage of net patient revenues from various payors in the company s hospitals for the periods indicated years ended june  source medicare medicaid self pay commercial insurance other during the fiscal year ended june   we have experienced a decrease in medicare as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in medicaid and commercial insurance and other revenues 
in each case  the changes were due primarily due to increased managed care patients and increased out patient revenues 
the level of our self pay net revenues as a percent of net revenues was unchanged in fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   sunlink experienced an increase in medicaid and self pay revenues as a percentage of net revenues and an offsetting decrease in medicare revenues  due primarily to the patient mix of the two acquired healthmont hospitals 
net revenues included  and  from a state indigent care program for the year ended june  and  respectively 
cost of patient services revenues  including depreciation  were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
cost of patient service revenues as of of net revenue years ended june  salaries  wages and benefits provision for bad debts supplies purchased services other operating expenses rent and lease expense salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june   primarily due to higher contract labor 
contract labor increased due to higher utilization of contract nursing services 
provision for bad debt expense decreased as a percent of net revenue in the current year due to improved up front collections and increased commercial insurance net revenues 
other operating expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june   although insurance expense increased by approximately  from the prior year due to higher premium costs and self insured reserves 
physician recruiting expense included in other operating expenses decreased from the prior year due to fewer physicians receiving guarantees during the year 
salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june   primarily due to higher contract labor and employee health insurance claims 
contract labor increased due to higher contract labor costs at our healthmont facilities and increased nursing contract labor at certain hospitals near larger metropolitan areas 
the provision for bad debts was of net revenues in the year ended june   a decrease of of net revenues from the prior year 
the decrease resulted from reclassifying approximately  of uncollectible indigent care net revenues from bad debt expense to a reduction of net revenue required by the participation of one hospital in a state s indigent care program 
without this reclassification  bad debt expense would have been of net revenues for the year ended june   
index to financial statements or an increase of of net revenues in fiscal the increase was due to more difficult collection of deductibles and co insurance payments due to the overall decline in economic conditions and a higher percentage of self pay net revenues at one of our healthmont facilities 
the increase in other operating expenses as a percent of net revenues reflects increases in insurance and physician recruiting expenses 
insurance expense increased by  in the year ended june  and physician recruiting expense increased by  as compared to the same period in we expensed previously capitalized costs of during the year ended june  relating to our acquisition of healthmont 
such costs were expensed in the second fiscal quarter of because at that time sunlink could not determine that it was probable that the healthmont acquisition would be completed 
subsequent to that time  an amended merger agreement was executed such that thereafter we believed it was probable that the acquisition would be completed  accordingly no further acquisition costs were expensed 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to decreased debt of approximately  during the year ended june   resulting primarily from the use of proceeds from the sale of mountainside in june the increase in interest expense in fiscal was due to increased debt owed for most of fiscal due to approximately  of debt assumed or undertaken in connection with the healthmont acquisition and increased revolving advance borrowings under the sunlink credit facility during the year 
in october  we repaid  from proceeds of a new  credit facility  mortgages totaling  due august  a term note with a principal amount of  due august and a revolving loan with  outstanding 
the early repayment resulted in a loss on early repayment of debt of this loss is composed of of unamortized prepaid debt costs related to the repaid debt instruments and a penalty related to the early repayment of the revolving loan 
in june  we repaid a senior subordinated note principal amount of  due january  a term note principal amount of  due march  term loan principal amount of  due june and a  revolving credit facility  outstanding which had an expiration date of december  the early repayment resulted in a loss on early repayment of debt of  the loss is composed of  of unamortized discount on the senior subordinated note  of penalty related to the early repayment of the term loan and of unamortized prepaid debt costs related to the repaid debt instruments 
we recorded income tax expense of  federal and state tax expense for the year ended june  compared to an income tax benefit of federal benefit and state tax expense for the year ended june  and an income tax expense of federal tax and state tax for the year ended june  the federal tax expense for the year ended june  included of deferred income tax expense 
the federal benefit for the year ended june  resulted from adjusting our domestic deferred asset valuation allowance to reflect expected future tax benefits from the deferred tax asset that are more likely than not to be utilized in future periods 
we had an estimated net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes of approximately  at june  use of this net operating loss carry forward is subject to the limitations of the provisions of internal revenue code section as a result  not all of the net operating loss carry forward is available to offset federal taxable income in the current year 
we have provided a valuation allowance for  of our  gross deferred tax asset the majority of which is the net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes as it is our assessment based upon the criteria identified in sfas no 
that it is currently more likely than not that only  of the gross deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
earnings from continuing operations were  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  compared to a loss from continuing operations of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  and earnings from continuing operations of  per fully diluted share for the year 
index to financial statements ended june  earnings from continuing operations in fiscal resulted from increased operating profit and lower interest expense as compared to the prior year 
the loss in fiscal resulted primarily from the loss on the early repayment of debt of  and the increased interest expense which resulted from the increased debt assumed or undertaken in connection with the healthmont acquisition 
earnings from discontinued operations of for the year ended june  included of earnings after tax from operations of mountainside after its disposition  primarily due to collection of receivables in excess of allowances at the end of the prior fiscal year  reduced by of domestic pension items and of income tax expense related to the pension items 
earnings from discontinued operations of  for the year ended june  included  of after tax gain on the sale of mountainside medical center  reduced by  of pre tax loss from operations of mountainside prior to its disposition  of domestic pension items and of income tax expense 
loss from discontinued operations of  for the year ended june  includes an asset impairment charge of  relating to the predecessor facility to the mountainside medical center  of earnings of mountainside  of income tax benefit related to a domestic capital loss carry back and for domestic pension expense 
net earning for the year ended june  were  per fully diluted share compared to net earnings of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  and net earnings of per fully diluted share for the year ended june  the weighted average common shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings loss per share increased in the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior year due to the  shares issued october  for the healthmont acquisition and shares issued from warrant exercises during the period november to april the weighted average common shares used to calculate diluted earning loss per share increased in the current fiscal year due to the share issuance previously noted and increase in the company s share price during the fiscal year 
earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization 
we understand that certain industry analysts generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a company that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of a company and its ability to service debt 
we believe an increase in our ebitda level is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations 
operating profit for the years ended june  and was as follows years ended june  shl facilities ebitda hospitals healthmont facilities ebitda hospitals corporate overhead costs depreciation and amortization operating profit liquidity and capital resources we generated  of cash from operating activities during the year ended june  compared to the use of  from operating activities during the comparable period last year 
cash was generated from net 
index to financial statements earnings  discontinued operations primarily from the collection of retained receivables of mountainside medical center and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by income taxes paid and increased net patient receivables we used  of cash from operating activities during the year ended june  compared to  provided by operating activities during the year ended june  cash used in operations in fiscal resulted from the loss from continuing operations of  increased patient receivables from higher volume and decreased accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from payment of healthmont accounts payable assumed at the acquisition date 
sunlink expended   and  for capital expenditures at our hospitals included in continuing operations during the years ended june   and  respectively 
these capital expenditures were primarily for new and replacement equipment 
we believe an attractive  up to date physical facility assists in recruiting quality staff and physicians  as well as attracting patients 
on october  sunlink entered into a  five year senior secured credit facility comprised of a revolving line of credit of up to  with an interest rate at libor plus  a  term loan with an interest rate at libor plus and a  term loan with an interest rate at libor plus the sunlink credit facility 
only the  term loan has been drawn  of which  was outstanding at june  the proceeds were used to repay  of healthmont debt which was payable on august  sunlink is using the remaining funds from the initial draw and expects to use the funds available from the revolving line of credit for hospital capital projects  equipment purchases and working capital needs 
the  term loan and draws under the  term loan are repayable pursuant to a year term amortization from the date of draw with final balloon payments due at the end of the five year maturity of the sunlink credit facility 
the total availability of credit under all components of the credit facility is keyed to the level of sunlink s earnings which would have provided for current total borrowing capacity at june  of approximately  borrowing under the  term loan may be used  subject to satisfaction of certain covenants  to satisfy a portion of certain obligations with respect to discontinued operations  to fund acquisitions or a portion thereof or to reacquire certain company securities 
costs and fees related to execution of the sunlink credit facility were the sunlink credit facility is collateralized by a first priority security interest in all assets and properties  real and personal  of the company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries  including a pledge of all of the equity interests in such subsidiaries 
if sunlink or its applicable subsidiaries experience a material adverse change in their business  assets  financial condition  management or operations  or if the value of the collateral securing the sunlink credit facility decreases  we may be unable to draw on the credit facility 
we believe we have adequate financing and liquidity to support our current level of operations through the next twelve months 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from continuing operations and availability under the sunlink credit facility 
the total availability of credit under all components of the sunlink credit facility is keyed to the level of sunlink s earnings  which  based upon the company s estimates  would provide for current borrowing capacity of approximately  at june   of which  was outstanding under a term loan 
the current remaining availability of approximately  could be adversely affected by  among other things  the risk  uncertainties and other factors listed at the beginning of item  as well as lower earnings due to lower demand for our services by patients  changes in patient mix and changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services 
cash generated from operations could be adversely affected by  among other things  the risks  uncertainties and other factors listed at the beginning of item  as well as lower patient demand for our services  higher operating costs including  but not limited to  salaries  wages and benefits  provisions for bad debts  general liability and other insurance costs  cost of pharmaceutical drugs and other operating expenses or by changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services  and the regulatory environment of the community hospital segment 

index to financial statements contractual obligations related to long term debt  non cancelable operating leases and physician guarantees at june  were as follows contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies payments due in long term debt operating leases physician guarantees year years years years years more than years at june   sunlink had contracts with seven physicians which contain guaranteed minimum gross receipts 
the table above shows the maximum obligation sunlink had at june  for physician guarantees 
sunlink expenses physician guarantees as they are determined to be due to the physician on an accrual basis 
each month  the physician s gross receipts are accumulated and the difference between the monthly guarantee and the physician s actual gross receipts for the month is calculated 
if the guarantee is greater than the receipts  the difference is accrued as a liability and an expense 
the net guarantee amount is paid to the physician in the succeeding month 
if the physician s monthly receipts exceed the guarantee amount in subsequent months  then the overage is repaid to sunlink to the extent of any prior monthly guarantee payments and the liability and expense is reduced by the amount of the repayment 
sunlink expensed   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  for physician guarantees 
at june   we had outstanding long term debt of  of which  was incurred in connection with the sunlink credit facility and was related to capital leases 
sunlink currently utilizes three different management information systems at our seven hospitals 
five hospitals utilize comprehensive systems designed for larger hospitals and two hospitals utilize a system designed for smaller hospitals 
we are converting our hospitals to a single management information system to be implemented concurrently with the expiration of our existing software lease and support agreements which have unexpired terms of up to months 
in june  sunlink entered into a license and support agreement with a management information system company for a single management information system for our seven hospitals with an estimated cost of  for software  installation  training and support 
in july  sunlink entered into a capital lease for computer and other hardware for the new system with a total commitment of approximately the total cost of the software licenses  hardware  installation and training for the new management information system is estimated to be  approximately  of which is expected to be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the new system  which is years for hardware and years for the licenses and installation 
this conversion began in the fiscal quarter ending september  and is expected to be completed by september  discontinued operations krug international uk ltd 
krug uk  an inactive uk subsidiary of sunlink  entered into a guarantee the beldray lease guarantee  at a time when it owned beldray limited  a uk manufacturing business 
the beldray lease guarantee covers beldray s obligations under a lease for a portion of beldray s manufacturing location 
in october  krug uk received correspondence from the landlord of such facility that the rent payment of  british pounds for the fourth quarter of had not been paid by beldray and requesting payment of such amount pursuant to the beldray lease guarantee 
in january  
index to financial statements krug uk received further correspondence from the landlord demanding two quarterly rent payments totaling  british pounds under the beldray lease guarantee 
on january   the landlord filed a petition in the high court of justice chancery division to wind up krug uk under the provisions of the insolvency act of and krug uk was placed into involuntary liquidation by the high court in february sunlink s non current liability reserves for discontinued operations at june   included  for a portion of the beldray lease guarantee 
such reserve was based upon management s estimate  after consultation with its property consultants and legal counsel  of the cost to satisfy the beldray guarantee in light of krug uk s limited assets and before taking into account any other claims against krug uk 
the maximum potential obligation of krug uk for rent under the beldray guarantee is estimated to be approximately  as a result of this claim and the uk liquidation proceedings against krug uk  sunlink expects krug uk to be wound up in liquidation in the uk 
in january  bradley international holdings limited bradley  an inactive subsidiary of krug uk  sold its european child safety subsidiary  klippan limited klippan  to newell limited newell 
klippan was a guarantor of certain debt of beldray when it was a subsidiary of the company 
in august  bradley received a notice from newell that klippan had received a demand notice from a lender of beldray to pay under the guarantee 
as a result of the demand notice  in a letter dated october  to bradley  newell and klippan claimed that bradley had breached contractual warranties and or representations under the sale agreement 
bradley has denied any liability on the grounds that the sale agreement required all claims under warranties to be made on or before july  and no such claim had been made 
on november   sunlink received a demand letter from a commercial leasing company demanding payment with respect to the remaining lease obligations under a master lease agreement entered into by healthmont in july  prior to its acquisition by sunlink 
the claim was for payment of equipment leases for the two healthmont facilities that sunlink currently owns and operates and two facilities that healthmont sold prior to its acquisition by sunlink 
the claim was settled on december  through the sale and assignment of the master lease to sunlink for  which settlement resulted in expense of in the year ended june  because the amount of the claims alleged could have constituted material indebtedness under the sunlink credit facility and could thereby give rise to an event of default  sunlink sought and obtained a waiver under the sunlink credit facility 
additional contingent obligations  other than with respect to our existing operations  include potential product liability claims for products manufactured and sold before the disposal of our discontinued industrial segment in fiscal and for guarantees of certain obligations of former subsidiaries 
we have provided an accrual at june  related to the beldray lease guarantee  as discussed above 
we are currently in the process of liquidating two dormant subsidiaries in germany and france 
based upon an evaluation of information currently available and consultation with legal counsel  management has not reserved any amounts for contingencies related to these liquidations 
sarbanes oxley section we are currently in the process of planning for the evaluation  documentation and testing of our internal control systems in order to permit our management to be in a position to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls over financial reporting as of june   as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley 
as a consequence  we anticipate incurring substantial additional expenses in the fiscal year ending june  and subsequent fiscal years as well as diverting substantial time of the company s management and board of directors to this task 
while we currently are planning for timely completion of such documentation  testing and evaluation  there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement the requirements of section of sarbanes oxley with adequate compliance by june  should we be unable to do so  we could be subjected to investigation by regulatory authorities  
index to financial statements incur litigation costs and or suffer loss of our amex listing 
any such actions could adversely affect our financial results and or the market price of our common shares 
we incurred incremental costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley during the year ended june  we anticipate that these costs will increase and become significant in future periods 
specifically  the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley requirements is expected to result in increased operating expenses during the fiscal year ending june  and subsequent fiscal years 
although we do not currently have specific estimates of these costs  the cost of the initial implementation as well as on going compliance with section could be particularly high for the company due to its decentralized management structure and the fact that the three different management information systems are in use among our seven hospitals are not scheduled to be completely replaced by a single system until september  recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensuses of emerging issues task force issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share

 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred fiscal years beginning after june  its adoption by the company should not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

the guidance in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with  selling  goods or services 
this statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans  which are subject to aicpa statement of position  employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
sfas  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method for accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance of apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
although those disclosures helped to mitigate the problems associated with accounting under apb opinion no 
 many investors and other users of financial statements said that the failure to include employee compensation costs in the income statement impaired transparency  comparability and credibility of financial statements

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
interpretation is expected to result in a more consistent recognition of liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  b more information about expected future cash outflows associated with those obligations  and c more information about investments in long lived assets because additional asset retirement costs will be recognized as part of the carrying amounts of the assets 
interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  its adoption by the company should not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations
